    "comment": "This proposal undermines the independence of federal workers and erodes their employment protections. Federal workers often work for a lower salary than in the private sector in trade for job protections and benefits. This is nothing more than an effort to erode the federal government and the services it provides to all Americans citizens from Social Security to Head Start. I vehemently oppose this proposal, shame on the OPM. Your are supposed to protect America, not facilitate the demolition of our institutions.",

Recent leaked Schedule F lists from NOAA disproportionately identify scientists and science leadership, rather than people who make policy! 2) Accountability must apply across the board and not just middle-management, which is what this will ultimately affect not the low performing employee, but likely the high performing boss of that employee, concurrently, very senior leadership or senior executives will engage in self preservation will be further politicized and become corrupt and divorced from the mission.

    "comment": "this is a terrible idea. The underlying logic of this proposal is that, 1) all federal employees, no matter where they are located or what they do, must first and foremost be loyal to the President. This is, of course, patently ridiculous. 2) It implies that anyone can do any Federal employee's job; there is no requirement for institutional knowledge or specialization, or years of experience. This, too, is patently ridiculous. Federal employees hold positions ranging from lower-level (security guards and janitors, for example) to highly educated and experienced roles (research scientists and administrators). In any of these roles, Federal employees need to first perform the duties of the position to the level expected in their performance documents. As part of that review process, they should not be working against the government, no matter who the President is at the time. However, allegiance to that President above all else, as implied here, is UNAMERICAN and ACONSITUIONAL.\n\nIf implemented, it would move us further into authoritarianism with Federal employees whose allegiance, rather than skill, earns them employment. It would weaken services and disrupt our national security. None of this improves Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service; rather, it would destroy the Civil Service.",

This rule is one part of a larger project to do what our founders most feared\u2014turn the President into a king. To ignore this context and consider only the narrow technicalities of the proposal would either be willful blindness or purposeful manipulation of the rule-making process by those who naively and selfishly believe they will receive some favor from the would-be king.

    "comment": "I object to OPM's proposed new rule that would reclassify 50,000 federal workers to \"at-will\" employees. \"At-will\" employment will make it easier to fire any employee for political rather than merit-based reasons. Under \"at-will\" employment, no reason is required for termination. And, there is little recourse for appeal. \n\nUS civil servants are not political appointees and as such are not subject to removal by Presidential authority. The Civil Service was established to create a professional, non-partisan workforce rather than one based on cronyism. Fealty to the President and his agenda should never be a condition of civil service employment and yet, this is exactly what this proposed regulation seeks to establish. The regulation authors say the reclassification will make it easier to fire employees for \"intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\" This is moving our government further in the direction of a dictatorship. This reclassification effort is a huge over-reach by the Executive Branch which will undermine the federal workforce and reduce public trust in government. \n\nAnother reason given for changing civil servants to at-will employees is that the current protections employees enjoy (e.g., a fair workplace) purportedly makes it difficult \"to hold employees accountable.\" If that is the case, improve the evaluation system. \n\nThe drafters of this rule assert that \"positions will remain career jobs filled on a non-partisan basis.\" This is a disingenuous claim. At-will employment undermines career employment. Job security and due process for employees are critical assurances to those who seek a career job in the federal government. These do not rule out a robust training and evaluation program to ensure good job performance. \n\nIn addition, the assertion that one can be fired without due process for \"intentionally subverting Presidential directives\" undermines the professional, non-partisan character of civil service positions. The message is clear. Obey or be gone. No professional person would choose to work under such conditions. Our government has long upheld model employment regulations. Let's not abandon our commitment to a fair working conditions for a President's political gain.",

    "comment": "Comment on Proposed Rule: \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" (Docket Number: RIN 3206-AO72)\n\nIntroduction\n\nI am submitting this comment as an academic physician-scientist with more than a decade of experience conducting NIH-funded research at Massachusetts General Hospital with appointments at Harvard Medical School and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. As a researcher with extensive experience in the NIH grant system, I am writing to express significant concerns regarding the section of the proposed rule that designates employees with \"substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking\" as potentially occupying \"policymaking positions\" that could be reclassified under Schedule Policy/Career.\n\nSpecific Concerns with the Proposed Rule\n\nThe proposed rule identifies grant-making as \"an important form of policymaking\" and suggests that employees with \"substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions.\" This characterization fundamentally misunderstands the scientific grant review process at agencies like NIH and NSF, which rely on scientific merit and peer review rather than political considerations.\n\nThe stated purpose of this rule is to allow agencies to \"quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\" When applied to scientific grant-making, this creates a dangerous framework that could politicize what should be an independent, merit-based process.\n\nEvidence-Based Arguments\n\nThe primacy of American scientific research in the world depends on insulating technical grant review from political influence:\n\n1. NIH and NSF grant review processes are designed to fund the most scientifically promising research through rigorous peer review. The NIH is \"arguably the most important institution shaping the rate and direction of scientific research\" with significant implications for human well-being. Even small changes to how funding is allocated could have massive effects on social welfare.\n\n2. International examples demonstrate the severe consequences when politics interferes with scientific funding decisions. Soviet biology, which had achieved peak prominence by the mid-1930s, was essentially ruined by Lysenko's politically-backed campaign against genetics (Ptushenko, Genetics, 2021). The damage was so profound that even after Lysenkoism was officially renounced in 1964, it took decades for Russian science to recover from this political interference.\n\n3. Similarly, in countries like China where \"personal relationships have affected government decisions, such as the review of scientific grants,\" scientific integrity issues have damaged progress despite massive investments (Zeng et al. Dev World Bioeth, 2010). Studies indicate that politicization of science funding leads to inefficient allocation of resources, limiting China's ability to achieve global scientific leadership commensurate with its spending (Shu et al. Minerva, 2022; Yu et al. Res Policy, 2022).\n\n4. The existing peer review system, while imperfect, provides important guardrails against bias. These decisions should be made by scientific experts, not political appointees.\n\nSpecific Recommendations for Improvement\n\nI propose the following improvements to the rule:\n\n1. Explicitly exclude scientific grant review personnel at NIH, NSF, and similar research agencies from the Schedule Policy/Career designation. Scientific merit review is a technical function, not a political one.\n\n2. Provide a clear, narrow definition of what constitutes \"substantive discretionary authority\" in grant-making that distinguishes between technical evaluation based on scientific merit (which should remain protected) and truly discretionary policy decisions.\n\n3. Add specific safeguards ensuring the independence of scientific peer review committees from political interference, including explicit protections for review panel members.\n\n4. Require transparency in any actions that would redesignate positions related to scientific grant review, including advance notice and comment periods specific to each affected role.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile improving accountability in government service is a worthwhile goal, applying at-will employment status to scientific grant-making personnel poses significant risks to American scientific leadership. The independence of the scientific grant-making process from political influence has been a cornerstone of American research excellence and must be preserved.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns with this proposed rule change. In short, I think the rule change would open the civil service up to political influence at the expense of carrying out the law and serving the American taxpayers. I am a federal employee yet these views are my own and do not necessarily represent my agency. I am writing as a concerned citizen and a student of good governance, on my own time.\n\n1. The rule conflates issues around performance and conduct with those of allegiance to policy. From my experience, issues with performance revolve around doing work of poor quality, not adequately fulfilling or understanding the assignment, or otherwise acting in ways that do not serve the mission. Conduct issues concern things like consistently showing up to work late, taking excessive breaks, or acting uncooperatively with colleagues. Issues around not following allegiance to policy are another matter, and would concern things like failing to follow the law or a legal Presidential directive.\n\nI'd like to see the evidence of staff not following laws or Presidential directives. From my experience, staff carry out laws and Presidential directives regardless of whether they agree; and if they don't, they switch jobs or quit on their own. For example, some staff at my agency did not agree with the Executive Order (https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/) which led to the taking down of materials that referenced Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Among other factors, we did not see it as a good use of time. But my agency did it. Similarly, prior administrations have made requests of staff that they may have disagreed with, yet they were carried out.\n\nStaff have been trained that if we have concerns, we comply, and then complain. Historically, staff have had the option of contacting the Office of Special Counsel or Inspectors General offices if they were concerned about waste, fraud, and abuse. As such, it has been disturbing these agencies had agency heads fired so early in the administration.\n\nIf staff are slow-walking or not carrying out directives now, it would behoove the administration to figure out why there has been a change in behavior. I think it's because this administration has represented a departure from legal or democratic ways of conducting government business. For example, various Executive Orders have directed actions which many consider illegal, such as shutting down federal agencies unilaterally, even though Congress has the legal right to pass laws to create or shut down agencies. It is especially troubling now because the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches are all led by the same party, so the administration is acting outside the legal system even when it ostensibly has the support it needs.\n\n2. As for addressing poor performance and conduct, I find that agencies do not use a tool at their disposal which would make their lives much easier: Assigning another manager either to manage a poor performer (from my experience, such performers are rare), or assigning that manager to manage existing staff so the current manager can focus on the poor performer.\n\n3. As it were, the civil service protections are admittedly a double-edged sword. The same protections which protect civil servants from undue political influence -- say, fabricating or withholding data to make an administration look better -- also serve to make it difficult to remove them. However, removing these protections makes any administration vulnerable to having the next administration come in and reverse them, thus catching the protection-removing administration in its own web. It would be short-sighted for any administration to remove these protections.\n\nThank you for your consideration of my comments.\nRich Levy",

Please do not do this.\n\nI firmly believe that politicizing the civil workforce will harm our country. The US's civil workforce, independent FED, and ability to keep much of the government's work in capable, skilled, and nonpartisan hands have allowed the US to become an economic force, a well-respected leader, and a strong nation. Please do not destroy this by adding more political workers to the workforce. \n\nOur country needs an experienced and consistent workforce, not one that is changing with the current president. In our country, we do not have a president for life, we do not have an authoritarian leader,  and we do not have a considerable government workforce that changes every four or eight years. It is the consistency and experience that keep our government functioning well. At the very least, the reason should be that this president cannot fill all the existing political appointments; why add more? But that is not the reason that I am concerned about this proposed change in government workers. Please do not cause more instability in our country. \n\nDo not fire any more government workers. Do not reclassify any government workers. We are losing valuable expertise and skilled workers, gaining nothing in return. Do not add a Schedule F to the government. \n\nThank you.\nCorinne\n",

Recent federal actions against civil servants are not only deeply disrespectful to those who have dedicated years of service to our country, but are undermining the quality of life of citizens in our great nation. \nAgencies such as the National Park Service, the US Forest Service, Veterans Affairs, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Bureau of Land Management, US Army Corps of Engineers, Center for Disease Control, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among many others, provide valuable services to manage our Nations resources and wellbeing. These agencies are invaluable and should continue to fulfill their important missions. In order to operate, these agencies need qualified and committed staff. Each of these agencies have Human Resource departments that manage staff performance through performance evaluations, improvement plans, and remedial actions as needed. No evidence has been provided that these Human Resource efforts are not working effectively.\nThe proposed rule appears to be a politized effort to further reduce the morale of staff in order to destabilize, shrink, and possibly eliminate these agencies. I strongly believe in the importance of these agencies. Furthermore, I believe in creating a work environment where workers are respected, fairly compensated, and supported so they can undertake the quality work that they do on behalf of our country. \nTo summarize, I strongly appose the proposed rule on Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.\nSincerely,\nKira Swanson\n",

I am not part of the federal workforce, but I greatly value the nonpartisan nature of civil service positions for several reasons including - this enhances the stability of those positions and ensures that there is not automatic turnover when a new party takes power. This gives the public the benefit of having experienced experts in place. I also object because having partisan loyalists in place would erode professional independence and make those employees susceptible to incredible levels of bias (e.g., if they want to keep their jobs, they have to do what the party in power wants, rather than being objective). There are also existing accountability mechanisms in place that make this new rule unnecessary. ",

Specifically, in the context of science, I am someone who has a PhD that was funded, in part, by the National Institutes of Health. I believe that the National Institutes of Health is an institution that has played an enormous role in the success of this country, in allowing for monumental scientific discoveries to be made which are valuable on their own, in addition to contributing to the development of medication (I believe that over 99% of all drugs were developed based on information contained in an NIH funded study) and contributing to the economic activity of this country (I have seen a statistic that says that for every $1 invested into the NIH, the economy recovers $2.46). Therefore, it is important to me to ensure that the National Institutes of Health remains an organization that continues to fund excellent science, in addition to carrying out groundbreaking research within the institute itself.\n\nI would like to comment on the part of this regulation removes protections from civil servants in order to make them easier to fire. I believe that this would be a grave mistake and am opposed to this change. I believe that allowing this change to go through would remove many nonpartisan experts from our federal agencies and would replace them with political appointees. In the context of the NIH, this would be disastrous because it would remove scientists who are renowned in their fields with decades of experience and replace them with political appointees who are interested in carrying out an ideological agenda, namely censorship of research and information that they believe is hostile to right wing causes. In the last months, we have seen the haphazard way in which the National Institutes of Health has terminated many active grants, in fields such as HIV, mRNA vaccines and more. The termination of vaccine-related grants is particularly troubling to me because the skepticism of mRNA vaccines is a result of right wing misinformation and is not based on solid research. I worry that if the NIH continues not to fund many promising areas of research in order to promote a political agenda, the discovery of cures for deadly diseases like cancer and Alzheimers will be delayed. \n\nFurthermore, science is a discipline that requires a lot of training and nuance and replacing experts with novices who are not equipped to make careful scientific decisions will harm the longterm prospects of this country. I know that the rule says that fired civil servants will be replaced with nonpartisans but all of the evidence I have seen so far, does not make me trust the administration when it comes to this statement. For example, the chief of staff of the NIH Director, a position that has always been held by a scientist was recently transferred to Seana Cranston, who is not a scientist but is instead a political operative who has worked with Representative Thomas Massie and Senator Rand Paul. Furthermore, the haphazard nature of the decisions made by the NIH under the Trump administration does not give me confidence that nonpartisan scientists who are fired will be replaced by skilled experts. For example, in an attemot to defund research which is \"DEI\", many important clinical trials testing drugs for diseases like Stage 4 breast cancer have been defunded, simply because they included an LGBTQ participant within the trial. We have also heard of the cancellation of research grants involving domestic partner violence, an issue which affects many women, but which the administration deemed \"unnecessary\" for a reason that is much more likely to be political rather than scientific. \n\nLastly, I am worried that if the status of these civil servants changes to being at-will, then Trump administration officials will be able to fire these employees for speaking out against unlawful orders or acting as whistleblowers. This would severely reduce the autonomy of even nonpartisan experts to carry out their jobs and make decisions that are best for science, even if they are at odds with the wishes of the administration.\n\nTherefore, it is my recommendation that these changes not go through and that civil service protections for civil servants remain in place. \n\nThank you.",

    "comment": "Dear Office of Personnel Management:\n\nI write to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule entitled \"Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\", published on April 23, 2025. The proposal seeks to exempt a newly defined category of \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d positions from the statutory protections of 5 U.S.C. Chapters 43 and 75, including the right to appeal adverse personnel actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). This proposal is inconsistent with governing federal statutes and exceeds the scope of executive authority.\n\n1. Statutory Protections Cannot Be Waived by Regulation\n\nCongress has clearly and intentionally established a legal framework that governs performance-based and adverse actions affecting federal employees. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4303 and 7513, covered employees are entitled to procedural protections, including advance notice, an opportunity to respond, and the ability to appeal to the MSPB. These protections were codified by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), which replaced earlier patchwork systems with a unified statutory framework. These rights are not discretionary, nor can they be modified or withdrawn by regulation.\n\nWhile the statute (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(b)(2)) allows for the exclusion of certain positions from Chapter 75, such as political appointees or positions designated as \u201cconfidential or policy-determining,\u201d it does not authorize the wholesale transfer of career civil service employees into newly created at-will categories through regulatory action. The authority to exclude positions from Chapter 75 is limited in scope and purpose and must be interpreted narrowly to avoid undermining Congress\u2019s express intent.\n\n2. The Proposal Violates the Separation of Powers\n\nBy unilaterally removing procedural protections through the creation of the \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d classification, the Executive Branch is attempting to do through regulation what Congress has expressly prohibited\u2014removing career employees without just cause, due process, or meaningful appeal. This raises significant constitutional concerns under the separation of powers doctrine. The Executive cannot override or nullify Congressional enactments through rulemaking.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that where Congress has created a comprehensive remedial scheme (as with the CSRA), judicial and administrative bodies must follow that framework. The proposed rule contradicts this well-established principle and risks subjecting the Executive Branch to legal challenge on administrative and constitutional grounds.\n\n3. Undermining Merit System Principles\n\nThe proposed rule would have a chilling effect on the integrity and independence of the civil service. Career employees in policy-influencing roles\u2014many of whom are technical experts or senior supervisors\u2014would become vulnerable to arbitrary dismissal, political coercion, or reprisal for faithfully executing laws as enacted by Congress. This undermines 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301, which mandates that employees be retained based on performance and protected from arbitrary action and personal favoritism.\n\nRemoving these protections does not enhance accountability\u2014it creates a workforce subject to political influence and fear, contrary to the principles that have guided the civil service for over a century.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety. The authority to alter statutory employee protections rests solely with Congress, and any attempt to circumvent that authority via regulation is unlawful and harmful to the public interest. I respectfully request that OPM reconsider this proposed rule in light of its legal and constitutional infirmities.",

    "comment": "Thank you for the opportunity to comment. Good managers can already document poor performers and have them removed with due process. This rule runs the risk of making the government workforce political. The last time it was mostly political was during the Harding Administration when there was rampant corruption. Hiring was changed to a merit-based system because of those scandals. Schedule F will mean the government will no longer be merit-based, and firings will happen if government workers don't close their eyes to corruption, misconduct, or reckless behavior of their superiors or peers. They may even be forced to participate in fear of being fired. In addition, there will be no long-term policy experience because government workers will change each Administration, and employees may also be too afraid to share their expertise and provide objective pros and cons of policies for decision-makers to consider. Employees generally seamlessly support new Administration's priorities but take their oath to the Constitution seriously - if it's legal, they will pivot accordingly; if it's not legal or if it's reckless, they will speak up on behalf of the American public. This is critical for transparency of the government and for the rule of law. Another point I want to make is that if one Administration creates a new office, another Administration can already easily move those employees and even have them do similar work supporting their own policies. Government workers already must choose between implementing new policies or leaving, unless they are asked to do something inappropriate in which case they should be able to freely speak. It's critical that the government workforce remain neutral and lawful and represent the public and the Constitution. Otherwise, there is the danger of a repeat of the Harding days with government employees working for political bosses rather than the American people. The lack of continuity in the workforce will be dangerous as well, especially since policies and procedures are often reinvented years later, and there will be no institutional knowledge of how to manage these changes or what the benefits and costs are. Whatever politicians decide, it's important that they have all the facts and are aware of the unintended consequences of policy changes.",

Even Ronald Reagan worked to end such violence against free speech and democratic principles. \nNot only that, Rump's and Musk's continued attacks on the federal workers (who help all of us in the United States to enjoy the freedom to live prosperous and healthy lives) are for the purpose of making themselves even more filthy rich while the rest of Americans struggle to stay afloat especially the elderly (Many of us who vote), children, and those needing medical help. We will be voting to remove this excrement from our lives soon.\nSo, stop now. The reasons behind the Docket Resolution (OPM-2025-0004)are entirely evil. This must be ended now. Those are proposing it should be removed from their jobs and any position in the federal government immediately. I am looking forward to voting out of office anyone promoting this sick and anti-American proposal.",

While there are legitimate issues with the speed and efficacy of government employee reviews, this proposed change would turn civil servants into a fearful, closed-off, and vindictive authoritarian arm of every administration current or future. Civil service is supposed to serve ALL of the American public, not the personal desires of the president or a single political party, and once this line is crossed there is no turning back. Any administration could threaten employees and upend due process and the lawful execution of reviews and implementation of policy and law, summarily firing any opposition without due process or recourse.\n\nThe enforcement of employee standards through weaponized political directive will have a chilling effect on employees reporting harassment, illegal activity, or poor performance for fear of retribution - this proposal will not only have the opposite effect of it's stated purpose but encourage and enable corruption and unaccountability.\n\nExamples given in the \"Proposed Rule Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" fact sheet demonstrate intent to use this change for that very purpose, while using examples like as the FDIC sexual harassment case as a \"gotcha\" to make opposing this change appear to condone such behavior. Not only is such behavior reprehensible, it would be ENABLED by this rule change, which would remove review and appeals recourse for employees fired for reporting such activity by supervisors, etc.\n\nI urge OPM to consider the precedent it is setting and the implications this drastic change will have during this AND future administrations, with the full implications and due weight of turning apolitical federal employees into a weaponized arm of power for any president.\n\nIn addition, 30 days is far too short a time frame to solicit comments for such a sweeping change - I strongly urge you to extend the comment period to a minimum of 120 days.",

The proposed regulations remove this longstanding and important protection without justification or due process.\n\nThe Federal Register notice doesn't provide a reasoned explanation for these wide-ranging changes, doesn't describe how these changes were developed or how lines will be drawn, and doesn't reflect any input from, or consideration of, the employees who would be affected  It doesn't provide sufficient detail on how the changes would be implemented, or by whom.  \n\nThese new proposals specifically undermine recent properly promulgated regulations meant to assure that the federal civil service would not become a patronage system, sacrificing competence for political fealty. By removing civil service protections through the proposed Schedule F expansion, employees would also be deterred from reporting wrongdoing due to fear of retaliation, thereby weakening whistleblowing safeguards. This would remove a valuable mechanism for identifying and reporting waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\nThe proposed Schedule F classification violates established federal laws and constitutional protections, and circumvents the role of Congress. Its implementation could fundamentally alter the structure and integrity of the federal civil service, leading to increased politicization and diminished employee rights and protections.\n\nI strongly urge that this proposal be withdrawn.",

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, this proposal allows politically motivated firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague criteria for classifying employees under this schedule and for firing employees who have been classified violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing the proposed schedule contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\nThe change is being justified as increasing employee accountability, but this term is not defined.  The preamble suggests that this reclassification will address poor performers within government, but does not explain how the \"at will\" status limits firing to poor performers or how the rule will address poor performance in non-policy-making positions.  The rulemaking provides several examples of employees behaving badly, but doesn't explain why existing rules and laws are insufficient to address these problems. The current system does allow federal supervisors to both fire poor performing employees and to encourage them to seek work elsewhere.   \nIn summery this change is counter to statute and ill-advised.  \n",

    "comment": "I write in strong opposition to the \"Schedule F\" classification as it threatens the merit-based civil service system that the nonpartisan federal workforce has been built upon for over a hundred years. The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 was specifically enacted to make the move from a spoils system to the current merit-based practice we have today. Reclassifying employees as Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated career actions, which flies in the face of the principles of a nonpartisan federal workforce. Specifically, I reference 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which requires federal employment decisions to be based on MERIT and be free from political influence. Given this administration's emphasis on merit-based hiring, Schedule F seems antithetical to its own priorities.\n\nAdditionally, the broad criteria used for the classification of an employee under Schedule F would also violate due process protections for career federal employees guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. Furthermore, OPM is bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit-based civil service system principles. Enacting Schedule F runs contradictory to this statute and places political pressure on career employees, undermining the integrity and continuity of federal programs across changing administrations. \n\nSchedule F represents a substantive threat to no only civil service independence, but the law itself. I strongly encourage this administration to review the relevant statutes and laws and reject any regulatory framework that seeks to skirt these codified protections of a merit-based system. ",

As noted above, no evidence of the targeted employees engaging in misconduct or performing poorly has been   provided. As for   undermining democratic  processes by  subverting Presidential directives, it is clear by the number of Presidential directives that have been enjoined by the federal courts, and will soon be determined to be illegal by the courts, that it's the Presidential   directives   that  undermine the democratic process_ It is  time to call the Presidential directives what are deliberate attempt to harm  federal employees' rights and benefits and to cripple union representation Sincerely; Neil C.

    "comment": "I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule titled *\"Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce\"* (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004-0001).

Giving one person the choice to fire anyone in federal service without warning will only cause chaos and loss of trust in government. People that work for the government take pay cuts to work these positions because they see federal jobs as a service to their country and are excluded from being disrespectedly fired as is done in at-will (what this bill mainly is about) terminations. Losing this benefit, will harm thousands of patriots and veterans. Ethically, a nightmare. This is how we descend into the very thing our government was created to end, Tyranny. This was recently what DOGE essentially failed at but attempted. Passing this law is as un-American as siding with dictators normally would be. As a federal employee myself, I am ashamed of what has been acceptable behavior. Lies are now not only acceptable but also unquestionable and unquestioned. Of course my words will sway none of the sycophants and Family cultists, but at least I can freely write them, for now. Signing this into law takes away protections and benefits partisanship. At-will terminations are great for profits but devastating to those who serve. Shame on this whole idea of running the government like a privately owned capitalist corporation instead of a government of the people, by the people, FOR the people, because those two routes are diametrically opposed.

    "comment": "The ability of the National Institutes of Health to create, support and stimulate the scientific accomplishments of the broader national research workforce has always relied upon the fact that exceptional scientists with remarkable leadership abilities are employed in directorial positions at the individual Institutes. They make decisions with science and data in mind, rather than politics. Furthermore, the nature of their appointments ensures that their vision can extend long beyond a single federal administration or Congress, thereby ensuring that the long game, which is vital to scientific progress, can be achieved.

    "original_comment": "The ability of the National Institutes of Health to create, support and stimulate the scientific accomplishments of the broader national research workforce has always relied upon the fact that exceptional scientists with remarkable leadership abilities are employed in directorial positions at the individual Institutes. They make decisions with science and data in mind, rather than politics. Furthermore, the nature of their appointments ensures that their vision can extend long beyond a single federal administration or Congress, thereby ensuring that the long game, which is vital to scientific progress, can be achieved.

    "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule aimed at \"strengthening employee accountability\" by creating Schedule Policy/Career within the excepted service and removing due process protections for employees in policy-influencing positions. While the stated goals of accountability and democratic responsiveness are important, this rule, in its current form, poses significant risks to the integrity of the civil service and the principles of fairness and due process.\n\nThe removal of Chapter 43 and 75 protections, including Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeals, for a broad category of \"policy-influencing\" career employees is deeply concerning. This action would essentially create a system of at-will employment for a significant portion of the federal workforce, making them vulnerable to arbitrary or politically motivated removal without adequate recourse. The historical context provided in the proposed rule itself highlights the dangers of a purely patronage-based system, which this rule risks resurrecting in a new guise.\n\nWhile the proposal claims to maintain nonpartisan hiring for Schedule Policy/Career positions, the lack of meaningful job security and appeal rights inherently politicizes these roles. Employees in these positions would be incentivized to align themselves with the political preferences of the current administration, rather than providing objective and expert advice based on their professional expertise and the best interests of the public. This could lead to a decline in the quality and impartiality of policy recommendations and the erosion of the institutional knowledge that career civil servants provide.\n\nFurthermore, the definition of \"policy-influencing\" positions appears overly broad and lacks clear, objective criteria. This ambiguity creates the potential for the rule to be applied to a wide range of employees, extending far beyond high-level decision-makers and encompassing individuals whose roles involve technical expertise or the implementation of established policies. Subjecting these dedicated public servants to at-will employment based on such a vague definition is unjust and undermines the principles of a merit-based civil service, where career professionals are selected and retained based on their qualifications and performance, not their political leanings.\n\nThe argument that current Chapter 43 and 75 procedures are overly burdensome and impede accountability should be addressed through targeted reforms to those processes, rather than a wholesale removal of fundamental employee protections. Streamlining procedures and ensuring timely resolution of performance issues are legitimate goals, but they should not come at the cost of due process and the creation of a politicized workforce.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge OPM to reconsider this proposed rule. Instead of dismantling essential employee protections and risking the politicization of the civil service, efforts should focus on refining existing performance management systems to ensure both accountability and fairness. The creation of Schedule Policy/Career, without adequate safeguards, represents a dangerous step backward that would undermine the professionalism, independence, and effectiveness of the federal workforce.",

    "comment": "With regard to the proposed OPM rule to politicize the civil service via the Schedule Policy/Career reclassification of federal employees, removing their civil service protections, and rendering them at-will workers, subject to illegal terminations based on baseless political preference. As a concerned American and decorated combat Veteran, I argue that the proposed rule is unlawful, procedurally deficient, and contrary to the public interest, particularly for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The rule should be withdrawn with prejudice immediately based on the following legal rational:\nFirst, it is a violation of Statutory Civil Service Protections. The proposed rule undermines the merit-based civil service system codified in Title 5 of the U.S. Code, particularly 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301, which mandates that federal employment be based on merit principles, free from political influence. By reclassifying employees in \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d roles as at-will workers, the rule effectively nullifies protections against arbitrary dismissal, violating 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511, which guarantees adverse action procedures for competitive and excepted service employees. For VHA employees, the rule also conflicts with Title 38 protections (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7401 et seq.), which prioritize stable staffing to ensure quality veteran healthcare. The Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 planned reduction of 83,000 jobs, tied to this rule, risks destabilizing VHA operations, contravening Congress\u2019s intent to prioritize veterans\u2019 care. \n\nSecond, this rule is a violation of the Arbitrary and Capricious clause under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), agency actions must not be arbitrary or capricious. The proposed rule fails to provide a reasoned basis for reclassifying employees, relying on vague criteria for \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d positions that lack clear standards, and are subject to the whims of political sycophants. OPM\u2019s estimate of impacting ~50,000 employees, including VHA administrative staff, is unsupported by data demonstrating how these roles undermine agency efficiency or necessitate at-will status. The rule also ignores the chilling effect on employee morale and recruitment, particularly in VHA, where staffing shortages already impair care delivery. OPM\u2019s failure to analyze alternatives, such as targeted performance management reforms, renders the rule arbitrary and capricious.\nThird, your insufficient comment period violates is a procedural deficiency in the Rule making process. The APA requires meaningful public participation (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553). The 30-day comment period, ending May 23, 2025, is insufficient for a rule with such far-reaching consequences, especially given OPM\u2019s bypassing of standard regulatory steps (e.g., declaring Biden-era protections inoperative). This curtailed process limits stakeholders, including Veterans, from fully assessing the rule\u2019s impact. Additionally, OPM has not disclosed sufficient data on affected positions or economic impacts, violating APA transparency requirements.\nThe rule jeopardizes the public interest by politicizing the federal workforce, undermining 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\u2019s mandate for OPM to uphold merit principles. For VHA, the rule\u2019s alignment with the VA\u2019s August 2025 RIF threatens healthcare access for veterans, as administrative roles are critical to clinical operations. This conflicts with Congressional directives in the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to prioritize veteran services. The rule\u2019s reliance on Project 2025\u2019s privatization goals further suggests an intent to weaken public institutions, contrary to Congress\u2019s commitment to a robust VA.\nAdditionally, the rule raises due process concerns under the Fifth Amendment by depriving employees of protected property interests in their jobs without adequate notice or hearing. Reclassification to at-will status, followed by potential termination without appeal rights, denies procedural protections established in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill (1985). This is particularly egregious for VHA employees with veteran status, who are entitled to hiring and retention preferences under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108.\nTo conclude, your rule is blatantly unlawful, procedurally flawed, and detrimental to the federal workforce and veterans\u2019 care. OPM should withdraw the rule or, at minimum, extend the comment period, provide detailed impact analyses, and revise the rule to comply with Title 5, Title 38, and APA requirements. I urge OPM to prioritize merit-based employment and protect VHA\u2019s ability to serve veterans.",

    "comment": "American biomedical science became preeminent because the NIH system allows expert scientists to set priorities, and working scientists to put forward their best most creative work that is then exhaustively reviewed by other experts for feasibility and impact. Sustained scientific progress cannot be proscribed from the top, because most important discoveries are serendipitous, and important breakthroughs and cures must build upon the knowledge generated through unfettered, often exploratory research. \n\nThis proposed change will degrade the ability of NIH to promote the best science by making it easier for whichever party is in power to control what science gets done. Putting political appointees in positions to set research priorities leaves the system vulnerable to ideologically manipulation, which means money and time will be wasted, and important discoveries will not be made. This was the path taken by Russian science after WWII, and the gulf that opened up between American and Russian biomedical scientific impact is illustrative of how inefficient that approach is. NIH and the science it has funded is an economic powerhouse, and should be seen as an investment rather than an expense. Making this system less efficient and more beholden to political whims is antithetical to the goal of investing in the best science. ",

Sustained scientific progress cannot be proscribed from the top, because most important discoveries are serendipitous, and important breakthroughs and cures must build upon the knowledge generated through unfettered, often exploratory research. \n\nThis proposed change will degrade the ability of NIH to promote the best science by making it easier for whichever party is in power to control what science gets done. Putting political appointees in positions to set research priorities leaves the system vulnerable to ideologically manipulation, which means money and time will be wasted, and important discoveries will not be made. This was the path taken by Russian science after WWII, and the gulf that opened up between American and Russian biomedical scientific impact is illustrative of how inefficient that approach is. NIH and the science it has funded is an economic powerhouse, and should be seen as an investment rather than an expense. Making this system less efficient and more beholden to political whims is antithetical to the goal of investing in the best science. ",

This proposal would NOT improve performance and accountability BUT WOULD dangerously erode the merit-based foundations of the federal workforce and risks politicizing what has historically been a nonpartisan, professional civil service who only answers to the constitution NOT to a person or political party. \n\nFirst, by exempting policy-related positions from adverse action protections, the proposal would allow political appointees or new administrations to remove career employees based solely on political loyalty rather than competence or adherence to law and scientific standards. This would replace institutional knowledge, technical expertise, and continuity in governance with ideological conformity. It risks creating a workforce where federal employees are hired or fired based on their political allegiance rather than their qualifications or performance.\n\nSecond, this change would all but guarantee mass turnover in federal staffing every four years, or even more frequently, depending on shifts in executive leadership.

This action undermines the foundational principles of a professional, nonpartisan civil service by allowing sweeping reclassifications of career employees into a new \"Policy/Career\" category, stripping them of critical civil service protections.\n\nBy enabling political appointees to remove experienced, apolitical federal employees based on subjective judgments about \"faithfully implementing\" administration policies, this order injects political loyalty tests into positions that are meant to serve the public interest, not partisan agendas. It opens the door to widespread politicization, chilling independent advice, honest analysis, and ethical decision-making that are vital to good governance.\n\nThe civil service was intentionally structured to prevent political interference and ensure that government expertise serves the American people consistently across administrations.

This action undermines the foundational principles of a professional, nonpartisan civil service by allowing sweeping reclassifications of career employees into a new \"Policy/Career\" category, stripping them of critical civil service protections.\n\nBy enabling political appointees to remove experienced, apolitical federal employees based on subjective judgments about \"faithfully implementing\" administration policies, this order injects political loyalty tests into positions that are meant to serve the public interest, not partisan agendas. It opens the door to widespread politicization, chilling independent advice, honest analysis, and ethical decision-making that are vital to good governance.\n\nThe civil service was intentionally structured to prevent political interference and ensure that government expertise serves the American people consistently across administrations. Gutting these protections risks turning the federal workforce into an unstable, revolving door of politically favored individuals rather than a steady, expert-driven institution.\n\nI urge the administration to withdraw this executive order and instead strengthen the merit-based system that has long protected the impartiality of our federal workforce.\n",

By carving approximately 50,000 positions out from longstanding civil service protections, this change opens the door to politicized firings rather than performance-based actions.

When non-supervisory staff fear dismissal for expressing views or implementing policies they believe in, morale and retention will suffer\u2014and the federal government will lose talented professionals to the private sector.  This rule, if finalized, will chill open discourse, encourage loyalty pledges over competence, and discourage qualified individuals from public service.\n\nRather than eroding the neutrality of the federal workforce, OPM should focus on enhancing existing performance-management tools\u2014such as clear, consistent evaluation criteria and robust training for supervisors\u2014while preserving essential appeal rights.

    "comment": "Dear Office of Personnel Management,\nI am writing to express serious concerns regarding the proposed rule to create Schedule Policy/Career positions within the excepted service. While I understand the stated goal of enhancing accountability, this rule is fundamentally flawed legally and as a matter of policy. Below, I outline specific issues related to statutory conflicts, constitutional challenges, procedural deficiencies, and broader policy implications.\n \n1. Conflict with Statutory Protections\nThe proposed rule appears to contravene several provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), which established a uniform framework for employee protections. Specifically:\n\u2022Adverse Action Rights: By excluding Schedule Policy/Career employees from Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5, the rule strips them of procedural safeguards, including the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeal rights. This exclusion undermines Congress\u2019s intent to provide federal employees with due process and fair treatment, as affirmed in cases like United States v. Fausto (484 U.S. 439 [1988]).\n\u2022Merit System Principles: The merit system principles enshrined in Title 5, Section 2301(b), emphasize nonpartisan retention based on performance. Converting these roles into at-will positions risks politicization, directly contravening these principles.\n \n2. Constitutional Concerns\n\u2022Fifth Amendment \u2013 Due Process: The removal of appeal rights infringes upon employees\u2019 constitutional property interests in their jobs, as recognized in Arnett v. Kennedy (416 U.S. 134 [1974]). This lack of due process poses significant constitutional challenges.\n\u2022First Amendment \u2013 Free Speech: Creating at-will positions could have a chilling effect on employees\u2019 ability to express dissenting or critical views, even outside their professional duties. Such policies risk violating precedents like Pickering v. Board of Education (391 U.S. 563 [1968]), which protect employees\u2019 rights to free expression.\n \n3. Violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\n\u2022Lack of Rational Basis: The rule's justification relies on anecdotal evidence rather than a robust analysis of systemic challenges. The cited difficulties in addressing poor performance and misconduct are not substantiated with comprehensive data, falling short of the APA\u2019s requirement for reasoned decision-making (Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29 [1983]).\n\u2022Arbitrary and Capricious Action: The rule\u2019s sweeping changes ignore less intrusive alternatives for addressing performance issues. This lack of proportionality may render the rule arbitrary under the APA.\n\u2022Insufficient Public Engagement: If comments are inadequately addressed or the decision appears predetermined, it could lead to procedural violations, further invalidating the rule.\n \n4. Policy Implications\n\u2022Undermining Nonpartisanship: Federal employment is merit-based, a cornerstone of public trust in government. This rule risks politicizing critical roles by allowing terminations based on subjective evaluations, which could erode that trust.\n\u2022\tImpact on Workforce Morale and Recruitment: Moving key positions to at-will status may create a culture of fear and instability, deterring highly qualified professionals from seeking public service roles. This could significantly weaken the federal government\u2019s institutional expertise over time.\n\u2022Unintended Consequences: The rule may foster a toxic work environment by discouraging whistleblowing and incentivizing compliance over ethical or professional judgment, potentially diminishing overall efficiency and accountability.\n\nThe proposed rule poses substantial legal and policy challenges. It undermines statutory protections, raises constitutional concerns, and conflicts with the core principles of the civil service. Furthermore, it negatively affects workforce morale, public trust, and government efficiency.\n\nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to withdraw this proposed rule and instead explore alternative measures that address performance challenges without compromising legal protections or the integrity of the federal workforce.\n",

    "comment": "This proposal strips veteran employees of their vet preference. Vet preference is an earned employment category that most public state and federal agencies recognize and utilize to encourage veterans to continue their service to Americans. By converting career employees with vet preference to schedule F, you remove the RIF categories which includes vet preference and protects veterans from being terminated before non veterans. 30% of the federal workforce are people who have served their country honorably. This administration should consider EXCLUDING veterans from this category and allow them to retain their job protections as a veteran. Unemployment and homelessness among veterans is an ongoing concern and complex issue. The government should be taking care of veterans not removing the employment protections they earned through serving this country. ",

    "comment": "This legislation is not going to improve federal service or help the American people. By politicizing these jobs, you create an environment where the laws and regulations that appeal to each party can be emphasized and funded, while the ones that do not align with the administration in charge are defunded and disbanded. The American people are then eft with an abundance of confusion about what they can count on from each Agency. The American people deserve better than that! They deserve a consistent, well-serving Federal workforce made up of people from all walks of life and all political, economic, and racial groups. When the Federal workforce is aligned like the populace they serve, the service is fairer, and more consistent. And by not switching priorities every 2-4 years, the populace will know what to expect and how the Federal workforce will serve them at the present and into the future. This creates a secure America!\nFor example: if a person wanted to open a business that would distribute food products across the country. They would be subject to Federal FDA rules. If the current administration didn't want, or didn't fund a robust inspection program to enforce the rules, the business owner might open their business without the food protections that cost them considerable money. The food could be harmful and the American people could be at risk of getting sick. But even if that doesn't come to pass, if a differently aligned political party comes into power 2-4 years later, and a robust inspection program is funded, the new business owner could get inspected and found to be deficient. NOW they have to put in equipment or process that cost money, perhaps money they don't have. They were caught in an uncertain business climate and now they may have to take out loans to cover the cost or dip into the business's cash, or raise prices, or go out of business. This scenario can be thought through in the opposite direction, as well. Either way, it isn't fair to the business owner, the consumers, or the investors. \nAnother scenario: A young person who loves working in the outdoors considers a job at the National Park Service after high school. Due to a learning disability, they do not do well in a school setting and are sure that college is not for them. But they have a service-minded personality and would be thrilled to work in a National Park, cleaning up after disrespectful tourists, manning a booth taking admission fees, maintaining trails and assisting with conservation efforts. When this person graduates from high school, the political climate is favorable to become a NPS employee and they take a job with the NPS. After a number of years doing exceptional work, this person marries, buys a house, has children and enjoys the security of the job. But after a number of years, a new political administration comes in that doesn't believe that our National Parks are a treasure to protect and decides that the NPS workforce can be severely reduced and this person is fired (RIF'd). They have no college education and are now unemployed with a mortgage and family to support. Perhaps they could go to a state park to work and make considerably less pay, but they will probably have to take a job that doesn't align with their personality, skills, and experience. This is unfair to the worker. And it is unfair to the American people who want to enjoy our National Parks and need them to be maintained to do so! Having this priority at risk of changing on a whim, is not fair to the American people. Some may have chosen to live near, or spend their money to travel to these parks. They expect a consistent experience and deserve it if they are going to spend their hard-earned money on frequenting them.\nPeople say that this can happen at any job - any company can lay off any worker. But a company is different than a Federal Service. A company is a for-profit entity that needs to do what it has to - to stay in business. Federal Agencies are not for-profit companies. The American government is NOT a for-profit company. And it shouldn't be treated as such. Yes, the government should run as efficiently as possible, but service consistency MUST be maintained. Hiring and firing people at the will of each political party will destroy consistency. \nYes, the Federal deficit is huge! But trying to balance that by firing federal workers is not an efficient way to do that. The Federal Agencies ALL provide value and increase revenues over the long term. Inefficiencies and unproductive workers should be weeded out, and has been over each political party. But by making Federal workers at-will employees would hurt America over the long-term. \nI do not support changing Federal workers into at-will employees. I think it is a poorly thought out idea that will destroy our American services and hurt ALL Americans.",

It erodes trust in the civil service, discourages qualified applicants, and risks the public receiving biased, politically driven service instead of neutral, expert support.\n\n2. Amending 5 CFR part 212 (Competitive Service and Competitive Status):\nStatement:\nLetting employees keep their competitive status \"on paper\" while actually stripping them of competitive service protections undermines both employee rights and the principle of fair, merit-based government.\n\nWhy it should not be implemented:\nThis creates a false sense of security for employees while weakening the systems that protect them from unfair treatment. For the public, it means less stability and independence in the federal workforce, making it harder for agencies to consistently deliver services without political interference.\n\n3. Amending 5 CFR part 752 (Adverse Actions) and part 432 (Performance-Based Actions):\nStatement:\nRemoving due process rights \u2014 like appeal protections and performance review procedures \u2014 for employees shifted into Schedule Policy/Career roles opens the door to arbitrary firings based on politics, not merit.\n\nWhy it should not be implemented:\nWithout fair procedures, employees can be removed for political reasons, not job performance. This weakens the entire public service system, leading to instability, fear, and loss of experienced staff, which ultimately hurts the public who depend on expert, stable government services.\n\n4. Amending 5 CFR part 210 (Definitions Related to Political Appointments):\nStatement:\nChanging the definition so that career employees can now hold \"policy-influencing\" roles \u2014 once reserved for political appointees \u2014 invites political favoritism into what should be a professional, merit-based civil service.\n\nWhy it should not be implemented:\nThis undermines the tradition that career employees serve the country, not a political agenda. It risks critical decisions being shaped by political loyalty rather than expertise, harming the quality and impartiality of services that the public deserves.\n\n5. Amending 5 CFR part 302 (Procedures for Moving Employees into Policy Positions):\nStatement:\nRemoving rules that provided oversight and appeal rights when moving employees into policy roles guts transparency and makes it easier to sideline or oust employees without fair warning or review.\n\nWhy it should not be implemented:\nWhen movements and staffing changes happen in the shadows, without accountability, corruption and favoritism grow.

Removing those protections will harm government hiring efforts by removing a benefit which helps to attract top talent despite comparatively lower salaries than in the private sector.",

    "comment": "Office of Personnel Management Proposed Rule \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" - Docket OPM-2025-0004\n\nI am commenting to express my strong and continued opposition to the proposed rule \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" as published in the Federal Register (90 FR 17182), Docket OPM-2025-0004.\n\nThe creation of a \"Schedule Policy/Career\" designation for policy-influencing positions, making them at-will and removing standard adverse action procedures and appeal processes, would fundamentally undermine the principles of a nonpartisan and merit-based civil service. This proposed change appears to inject political considerations into personnel decisions, creating an environment where career employees in critical roles could be removed for reasons other than poor performance or misconduct, specifically for perceived disloyalty to an administration's policy directives. This politicization would erode the professional independence of the civil service and lead to instability and a loss of valuable expertise within government agencies.\n\nThe lack of clear and objective criteria for defining \"policy-influencing\" positions raises concerns that this could be applied too broadly, impacting a significant number of dedicated civil servants who are not in the most senior policymaking roles. The loss of due process protections for these employees would be a significant step backward in ensuring fair treatment and job security within the federal workforce.\n\nSpecific aspects of the proposed rule undermine the ability of policy advisors and agency leaders to fulfill their essential duties:\n\nUndermining the Obligation to Highlight Legal Conflicts: This rule could undermine policy advisors' fundamental obligation to thoroughly analyze and highlight potential conflicts between proposed presidential directives and existing laws, regulations, and legal precedents. The fear of being seen as \"intentionally undermining\" a directive could discourage advisors from providing critical, objective legal assessments, potentially leading to ill-conceived or legally challenged policies.\n\nJeopardizing Careers for Respecting Legal Authority: The proposed rule jeopardizes the careers of dedicated policy makers who, in upholding their oath and the rule of law, respect congressional veto overrides or comply with court orders that directly oppose presidential directives. An employee should not face the threat of termination for adhering to the legal framework of our government. This rule creates a dangerous precedent where loyalty to a directive could be prioritized over the obligation to respect the balance of powers.\n\nCompromising Congressional oversight and the Independence of Agency Heads: This proposal compromises the intended role and independence of agency heads who are often approved by Congress and mandated to maintain a degree of autonomy to effectively carry out their agencies' missions. The fear of being deemed to be undermining a presidential directive could pressure these leaders to prioritize political alignment over their statutory obligations and professional judgment, ultimately hindering the effective functioning of government.\n\nMoreover, I want to emphasize that processes already exist within our system of governance to prevent federal employees from subverting the intention of laws and regulations. Mechanisms like the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provide checks to ensure agency actions align with legislative intent and established procedures. The proposed rule appears to disregard these existing robust frameworks designed to ensure accountability and prevent overreach.\n\nFinally, the definition of \u201cpolicy making or policy influencing\u201d positions in the proposed rule is excessively broad and dangerously open to abuse. Without clear and specific criteria, this designation could be applied arbitrarily to a wide range of career civil servants, including those whose roles have limited direct influence on high-level policy decisions. This lack of precision creates the potential for politically motivated reclassifications and subsequent removals, undermining the merit-based principles of the civil service.\n\nThis proposed rule, if implemented, would not only politicize the civil service but also create a chilling effect on objective policy analysis, undermine the rule of law within the executive branch, and compromise the necessary independence of agency leadership. It also disregards existing accountability mechanisms and relies on an overly broad and abusable definition.\n\nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to carefully consider these critical points and abandon this ill-conceived proposal. A robust and effective government relies on a civil service that is both accountable and empowered to provide objective advice and uphold the legal framework of our nation without fear of political reprisal.",

Our democracy needs a professional civil service dedicated to implementing the law.  We need clear and rules to attract and protect people who choose to work in government, for the public good.  This replacement to the regulations issued in April would remove those protections and allow the President to fire a huge swath of the civil service and replace those people with political appointees.   This would not only politicize a workforce that should be nonpartisan - it would open the civil service to corruption. People could be hired as rewards for loyalty to the President rather than to the law, the Constitution, and the people.  We don't need more patronage - we need less.  The reckless cuts that DOGE has made has to the federal workforce has already started killing people who depended on USAID for food and vital drugs. These cuts have also destabilized the rule of law, harmed the reputation of the federal government as an employer, and harmed the American people (e,g, we cannot even inspect food plants anymore).  These changes to the rules would only enable more of that.   ",

With such an expedited turnaround from E.O. to proposal, and no substantive discussion on the economic impacts of this rule, which would seem to be significant in terms of potential mass-firings over time, it appears not.\nSecondly, it\u2019s laughable hypocritical that an administration unabashedly dedicated to tit-for-tat patronage in political and staff level appointments (e.g., the DOGE employees selected by Elon Musk, and unelected special employee, now embedded across departments) would pretend to be so concerned with such activities occurring at the lowest levels of government. And the evidence that there are parties attempting to \u201cresist\u201d from within is weak at best, and frankly displays zero understanding of the actual workings of federal agencies, and their dedicated career staff. \nThird, the reliance on a walk through history beginning in the 1800s (when black people were enslaved, women had no rights, and workers would routinely die on the job needlessly due to lack of basic safety requirements) is sad. If you think the 1800s, early 1900s, etc. are the benchmark society that we American citizens want to live in now, please disabuse yourselves of that notion. The forward movement in the laws of the 1960s and 1970s, a time when equality and fairness was finally being paid attention to on a national political level are why those laws should stand, and the protections under those laws via the regulations for civil service protections are good.\nFinally, I do believe that it is difficult to ultimately fire certain employees in the civil service, but I do not believe the issue is with the protections they are offered. Rather, I believe that there is a lack of accountability from the top down to address poor performers according to the rules and processes available. A reform at the agency level to ensure existing responsible managers are following the rules that exist would be a more effective and circumspect approach to poor performers.\nIt is also not clear at what level the ability to fire newly at-will employees would reside. Only managers with direct knowledge of an employees duties and performance should have that ability. This rule does not make that clear.\nGo back to the drawing board and study current law, GAO reports, and IG reports to understand how to address the issue of accountability you claim is the goal of this rule. Of course, I don\u2019t think that is the goal, given the backdrop it is proposed against, of mass-firings across government with unfounded or ill-founded reasoning.\n",

    "comment": "This change to Federal civil service would replace a transparent system that has merit-based hiring and clear review process for employee performance with a simple system where any underperforming employee is given a sing opportunity to improve or be fired.  The new system proposed creates an opaque system to determine 'policy influencing positions' and provide unilateral ability to fire those employees not based on performance, but perceived loyalty to elected officials.  This replaces objective career professionals who are loyal to the U.S. Constitution, rather than elected officials that rotate in and out of power.  This would be detrimental the professionalism and objectivity of career expert civil servants to who defend the Constitution and implement laws passed by Congress with the funding allocated by Congress for the benefit of U.S. taxpayers.  This change is a thinly-veiled attempt to remove objective, professional experts, from being career civil servants and replace them with ideologues loyal to elected officials. The current merit system provides high-quality services.  The existing standards, review requirements, and transparent process for removing poor performers is functioning as intended to ensure that objective, expert, career civil servants are consistently providing quality services.  Creating this new schedule that allows politicians to remove staff they perceive has having different opinions is not in the best interest of the United States.  We should not take the risk of injustice from passion and prejudice, which no law or regulation can control, when there is already a transparent and effective system to remove civil servants that are not effective.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \"Schedule F\" classification (irrespective of its current name) for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence. While 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 grants the President authority to prescribe regulations for the competitive service, it DOES NOT permit blanket reclassification permission, nor removal of due process rights. \n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations. Additionally, the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule's broad reclassification of policy-related roles likely exceeds OPM's regulatory authority under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3302, which requires that exceptions to competitive service rules be \"necessary\" and \"conditions of good administration.\" Courts will likely strike it down as arbitrary and capricious under Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm (1983).\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. It disregards Title 5 protections, congressional intent, and judicial precedent safeguarding merit-based civil service. If implemented, it invites litigation under the CSRA, APA, and Constitutional doctrines, with a high likelihood of being struck down. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

As one of the 50,000 federal employees who could lose my\njob as a consequence of Schedule Policy/Career, I strongly oppose this rulemaking. Despite\nOPM\u2019s assurances to the contrary, I fear that officials in the current administration, or in a future\nadministration, will exploit Schedule Policy/Career to facilitate \u201cmass head-count reductions in\nthe federal bureaucracy.\u201d1\nGiven my experience, I am under no illusions that anything I say will persuade OPM to abandon\nits implementation of amended Executive Order 13957 and Schedule Policy/Career. Indeed,\nOPM has telegraphed that a reversal isn\u2019t happening, asserting that it \u201cmust comport with\u201d\nExecutive Order 13957 and that \u201c[d]eclining to help the President execute this directive would be\na dereliction of OPM\u2019s statutory duty.\u201d2 Fair enough; it would be unrealistic to expect OPM to\nsecond-guess an executive order issued by the current President. Accordingly, feds like me will\npin our hopes on the judicial branch, which will independently assess whether the Trump\nadministration\u2019s novel reinterpretation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 is the \u201cbest\nreading\u201d of that statute under Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2266\n(2024).3\nWhile the outcome of this rulemaking may be preordained, I have written this comment for one\nimportant purpose. Taking advantage of the candor afforded by anonymity, I hope to refute the\ndisparaging suspicion of federal employees at the heart of Executive Order 14171\u2014not only to\nunderscore that this initiative is unnecessary, but to convey to Trump administration officials that\n1 Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, The DOGE Plan to Reform Government, Wall Street Journal (Nov.\n20, 2024), https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-\nsupreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-\nramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-\nfa51c020.\n2 90 FR 17200, 17218.\n3 As a regulatory analyst, it would be supremely ironic if the Loper Bright decision ends up saving my\njob.\n1\nthey can trust in the capability and professionalism of career policy staff. Whether you believe it\nor not, we are here to help you.\nHowever, trust is a two-way street, and OPM has done much to diminish its credibility in the\ninitial months of this administration.4 To the extent OPM is sincere in promising that \u201cemployees\nwho faithfully perform their jobs to the best of their ability have little to fear from Schedule\nPolicy/Career,\u201d5 I urge OPM to implement meaningful safeguards beyond those included in its\nNPRM\u2014in particular, language that would prohibit the arbitrary firing or mass firing of\nSchedule Policy/Career employees. Such safeguards would demonstrate OPM\u2019s sincerity about\nthe stated intent of amended Executive Order 13957\u2014i.e., holding bad actors accountable\u2014\nwhile mitigating some of its harms.\nA Solution in Search of a Problem\nBefore getting into the details of the NPRM, I wish to share my perspective as a federal\nemployee who will likely be reclassified into Schedule Policy/Career, retaining my anonymity\nfor obvious reasons. For context, I previously commented in support of OPM\u2019s 2024 rule and\nwas quoted at length in the preamble of that rule.6\nAs I described in my earlier comment, I am a GS-13 regulatory analyst who works in the \u201cOffice\nof Policy\u201d of a prominent federal agency. For better or worse, my agency engages in some of the\nmost contentious policy work in the federal government. For example, my agency\u2019s policy\npriorities change dramatically depending on the political party in charge of the Presidency. Our\nrulemakings typically attract thousands of comments and have been the subject of Congressional\ncommittee hearings. Adverse stakeholders challenge our rules and sub-regulatory guidance in\ncourt, with disputes occasionally reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. My \u201csubstantive\nparticipation\u201d in this contested policy work is important and exciting,7 but given its sensitivity, I\nam scrupulous to maintain the effort, professionalism, and objectivity expected of a taxpayer-\nfunded federal employee.\nAs a career analyst, I have worked closely and successfully with political appointees under the\nObama, Trump, and Biden administrations to issue regulations and policy guidance consistent\nwith the policy priorities of those administrations. Naturally, I have personal opinions about the\npolicy work I do, and I sometimes disagree with my politically appointed leaders about specific\n4 See, e.g., Eric Katz, As Re-Firings Begin, Judge Demands Trump Administration Tell Probationary\nEmployees They Were Not Let Go for Poor Performance, Politico (April 21, 2025), https://\nwww.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/opm-firing-probationary-federal-agency-employees-judge-\nruling-00206615; Billy Mitchell, OPM Quietly Swapped Out Privacy Assessment for Governmentwide\nEmail System Central to Ongoing Litigation, FedScoop (March 3, 2025), https://fedscoop.com/opm-\nemail-privacy-assessment-swap-ongoing-litigation/.\n5 90 FR 17218.\n6 See 89 FR 25001 (Comment 3195).\n7 E.O. 13957, sec. 5(c)(i).\n2\npolicies or projects. In fact, robust civil service protections have empowered me\u2014and,\ncollectively, my coworkers and other career employees\u2014to occasionally share policy\nrecommendations or serious concerns with agency leadership, which sometimes results in our\nleadership changing course. This is a perfectly normal and healthy process, as career civil\nservants are supposed to provide candid deliberative advice to the politically appointed leaders\nwho ultimately make the decisions. As OPM continues to recognize,8 candid internal feedback\nfrom career policy staff helps to ensure that regulatory changes and other policy initiatives are\nmaximally effective, sustainable, and legally defensible.\nAt the same time, I and other career federal employees certainly understand that we are not the\ndecisionmakers. Elections in a democracy have consequences, and it is entirely appropriate for\nagencies to pursue the policy preferences of the elected President who appoints its leaders. This\nis widely understood by all federal employees, who typically go above and beyond Hatch Act\nrequirements to refrain from appearing politically biased whether we\u2019re on or off the clock.\nSpeaking personally, I have often worked to delay, withdraw, rescind, and/or replace rules that I\nhelped a previous administration to promulgate. Occasionally, I have drafted preamble language\nrebutting the very same language that I personally authored years before in an earlier\nrulemaking. I have also proactively \u201cpitched\u201d policy ideas to agency leadership in every\nPresidential administration, including in this administration. In fact, I and my coworkers have\nalready brainstormed numerous ideas for regulatory relief consistent with the deregulatory aims\nof Executive Orders 14192 and 14219.9\nGiven this experience, I am incredulous at OPM\u2019s assertion that policy resistance is \u201ca\nwidespread phenomenon.\u201d10 This assertion is a reversal from OPM\u2019s findings last year,11 and it\nflies in the face of my personal experience. Sensationalist claims about a widespread \u201cdeep state\u201d\nor \u201cresistance\u201d within the federal civil service simply do not reflect reality. For example, if there\ntruly was widespread \u201cpolicy resistance\u201d against the Trump administration among the 50,000\nemployees who might be reclassified into Schedule Policy/Career, one would expect ubiquitous\nleaks about agency rulemakings and other sensitive policy initiatives to news outlets and adverse\nstakeholders. Here, OPM cites to just one example of a career employee ever leaking a policy\ndocument\u2014a draft Presidential executive order promoting classical and traditional architectural\nstyles in the design of federal buildings.12 This one example, involving a seemingly trivial policy\nissue, does not establish that policy resistance is a \u201cwidespread\u201d phenomenon.13\n8 See 90 FR 17208 (\u201cCareer staff critiques, especially those coming from a political perspective that\ndiffers from political appointees, ultimately strengthens policymaking and produces better agency\ndecisions.\u201d).\n9 See 90 FR 9065 (Executive Order 14192); 90 FR 10583 (Executive Order 14219).\n10 90 FR 17194.\n11 89 FR 25000 (\u201cOPM does not agree that employing civil servants \u2026 thwarts the agenda of any\nPresident, and [such assertions] lack any well-founded support.\u201d).\n12 90 FR 17193 n. 151.\n13 To be clear, I do not condone the actions of that apparently disgruntled architect.\n3\nThe truth is that, like me, the overwhelming majority of career staff respect the integrity of the\npolicymaking process and the importance of deferring to our Presidentially-appointed leaders.\nOPM\u2019s citation to unscientific poll results and a handful of clickbait articles do not make a\npersuasive case to the contrary.\nIn sum, Schedule Policy/Career appears to be a solution in search of a problem. I am not opposed\nto holding bad actors accountable, but I have never witnessed or heard about insubordination or\n\u201cpolicy resistance\u201d at my agency of the kind imagined in the NPRM. So, as a threshold matter, I\ndisagree that there is a problem serious enough to justify stripping civil service protections from\nme and 50,000 other federal employees.\nWeak Protections and Hollow Assurances\nSection 6 of amended Executive Order 13957 provides that \u201c[e]mployees in or applicants for\nSchedule Policy/Career positions are not required to personally or politically support the current\nPresident or the policies of the current administration,\u201d and separately instructs agencies to\n\u201cestablish rules to prohibit the same personnel practices prohibited by [5 U.S.C. 2302(b)] with\nrespect to any employee or applicant for employment in Schedule Policy/Career of the excepted\nservice.\u201d14 Additionally, amended Executive Order 13957 deviates from the original Executive\nOrder 13957 by designating the new schedule as \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d rather than \u201cSchedule\nF\u201d\u2014ostensibly to rebut \u201cmisinformation\u201d that the administration will use the new schedule as \u201ca\nmeans of converting career positions to political positions.\u201d15\nThese protections are better than nothing, but they seem functionally unenforceable. As OPM\nnoted last year:\nOnce hirings and firings are at-will \u2026 [an] employee might not have an\nentitlement to written notice of the reasons for [an] adverse action, an opportunity\nto respond, or a written decision. Nor would the decision generally be appealable.\nIt would thus be, at a minimum, difficult for employees to protect themselves\nfrom actions based on political beliefs or party allegiance because no cause (or\nevidence) would be required prior to such an action. Under Schedule F, because\nsuch an employee would be at-will, the employer would need to give little or no\nreason prior to a termination. In short, Schedule F leaves innumerable ways for\npolitics to factor into these traditionally merit-based decisions in a manner that\nwould be difficult to detect or remedy.16\nEven in its new NPRM, OPM acknowledges the risk that \u201csome [agency] officials\u201d may \u201ctreat\nSchedule Policy/Career positions as noncareer positions\u201d and fire employees for perceived\n14 E.O. 13957, sec. 6.\n15 90 FR 17200.\n16 89 FR 24994 (citations omitted).\n4\npolitical disloyalty.17 In response, OPM replies that it will \u201cbe heavily involved in the\nimplementation of Schedule Policy/Career\u201d and \u201cif necessary \u2026 can recommend additional\nmeasures to prevent abuses.\u201d18 Respectfully, these vague assurances are not good enough. OPM\nis the federal agency with the duty to implement amended Executive Order 13957 and should not\nwait for predictable harms to materialize before merely \u201crecommend[ing]\u201d solutions. Indeed,\nsection 6(a) of amended Executive Order 13957 instructs that \u201cagencies\u201d\u2014including OPM\u2014\n\u201cshall establish rules to prohibit [certain] personnel practices\u201d against Schedule Policy/Career\nemployees,19 but OPM\u2019s NPRM fails to include any language about prohibited personnel\npractices in the proposed reg text for 5 CFR 213.3501.20 At minimum, OPM should fix that\noversight in its final rule.\nOf course, the bigger problem is that nothing in OPM\u2019s NPRM or in the express text of amended\nExecutive Order 13957 will protect Schedule Policy/Career employees from mass firings. As\nOPM notes, \u201cplacing \u2026 employees into Schedule Policy/Career makes them functionally at-\nwill.\u201d21 Thus, as long as agencies do not discriminate when they fire individual employees,\nagency heads will be newly empowered to quickly fire large groups of federal employees for no\nreason at all\u2014as many as 50,000 across the federal government, according to OPM's estimate in\nthe NPRM.22 Contemplating the protections afforded to Schedule Policy/Career employees, one\nis reminded of Joseph Stalin\u2019s infamous distinction between tragedies and statistics.\nIn a tacit acknowledgement of concerns that Schedule Policy/Career could be used for mass\nfirings, OPM assures that \u201cemployees who faithfully perform their jobs to the best of their ability\nhave little to fear from Schedule Policy/Career \u2026 [as] agencies have strong incentives not to\ndismiss employees who are competently performing their assigned duties.\u201d23 Of particular\nrelevance to me, OPM aptly notes that \u201cdrafting regulations and guidance \u2026 are complex tasks\nthat require considerable experience with the subject matter and technical procedures\u201d which\n\u201c[f]ew newly hired employees\u2014career or noncareer\u2014can do \u2026 effectively,\u201d concluding that \u201ca\nPresident who wants agencies to implement his policies has strong incentives not to dismiss\nexperienced regulation writers who are performing timely and quality work, no matter their\npersonal political affiliation.\u201d24 Relatedly, OPM asserts that \u201cthe President and his appointees\nhave additional incentivizes to maintain a career workforce that contains a diversity of views and\nopinions \u2026 [as] frank and fearless advice to agency leadership \u2026 helps agencies make better\ndecisions, which the President and agency leaders value.\u201d25\n17 90 FR 17209.\n18 Id.\n19 E.O. 13957, sec. 6(a) (emphasis added).\n20 See 90 FR 17222.\n21 90 FR 17218.\n22 90 FR 17220.\n23 90 FR 17218.\n24 90 FR 17208.\n25 90 FR 17208-09.\n5\nI wholeheartedly agree with OPM\u2019s statements quoted in the paragraph above, but they ring\nhollow in light of other actions and statements from the Trump administration exhibiting extreme\nhostility towards federal employees,26 including from President Trump. For example, in\ndescribing his regulatory freeze order issued on January 20, 2025, President Trump deviated\nfrom prepared remarks to quip that \u201cMost of those bureaucrats are being fired, they\u2019re gone.\nShould be all of them, but some sneak through, but we have to live with a couple I guess.\u201d27\nIn this context, in the absence of specific safeguards to prevent us from being fired for arbitrary\nreasons, OPM\u2019s assurances to career staff in the NPRM feels like gaslighting from the villain in a\npredictable horror film. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to have you for dinner! Would you mind stepping down\ninto that soundproof basement?\u201d\nConclusion\nWhile civil service protections are important for all federal employees, they are particularly\nimportant for career policy staff, who perform important work for considerably less pay than\nwhat they could earn in the private sector.28 Candor is key to our jobs, and civil service\nprotections are key to our candor. Unfortunately, amended Executive Order 13957 and new\nSchedule Policy/Career will strip civil service protections from thousands of federal employees\nwho are already weary and demoralized\u2014an extremely misguided policy move. Among other\nharms, the new Schedule Policy/Career will:\n\u2022 jeopardize the careers and livelihoods of thousands of federal employees;\n\u2022 deter career staff from providing candid deliberative advice for fear of perceived\n\u201cresistance;\u201d and\n\u2022 damage government efforts to recruit, hire, and retain talent, thereby reducing the speed\nand effectiveness of the federal government.\n26 See Executive Order 14210 of February 11, 2025, 90 FR 9669 (instructing agencies to \u201cpromptly\nundertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force\u201d); see also, e.g., Molly Redden and Andy\nKroll, \u201cPut Them in Trauma\u201d: Inside a Key MAGA Leader\u2019s Plans for a New Trump Agenda, ProPublica\n(Oct. 24, 2024), https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-\namerica-maga; Taylor Giorno, \u2018We Are Terrified\u2019: Musk Puts USAID Through \u2018Wood Chipper,\u2019 The Hill\n(Feb. 3, 2025), https://www.thehill.com/policy/technology/5122676-usaid-shutdown-elon-musk-doge/.\n27 See https://www.youtube.com/live/SzozeHjyLv4?t=656s; see also Erich Wagner, Trump: Agencies\nShould Fire 'All' Bureaucrats, Government Executive (Jan. 20, 2025), https://www.govexec.com/\nworkforce/2025/01/trump-agencies-should-fire-all-bureaucrats/402353/.\n28 For example, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \u201cFederal workers with a professional\ndegree or doctorate\u2014about 10 percent of the federal workforce\u2014earn about 29 percent less, on average,\nthan their private-sector counterparts.\u201d Congressional Budget Office, \u201cComparing the Compensation of\nFederal and Private-Sector Employees in 2022,\u201d (April 2024) at 1, https://www.cbo.gov/publication/\n60235.\n6\nAdditional safeguards\u2014such as a language prohibiting the arbitrary firing or mass firing of\nSchedule Policy/Career employees\u2014could mitigate some of these harms, but this\nadministration\u2019s damage to the federal workforce has already been immense. I don\u2019t fault other\nfederal employees who have decided to move on, but I plan to stick around as long as I can, as I\ncontinue to believe in the mission of my agency and in the importance of my job to that mission.\nGoing forward, I hope to work in partnership with my agency\u2019s new leadership, who I do not\nhold at fault for the actions of others in this administration. I had positive personal relationships\nwith political appointees from the first Trump administration, and I hope that a successful\ncollaboration this time around can serve as a positive example for the rest of the federal\ngovernment. At the same time, consistent with OPM\u2019s recommendation, I will continue to\nprovide \u201cfrank and fearless advice to agency leadership\u201d when I see critical mistakes.29 This\ncomment is submitted in that spirit.\nThank you for your consideration.\n29 90 FR 17209.\n7\n\n\n",

    "comment": "As a United States citizen and spouse of a federal employee, I am very much opposed to this new regulation. The federal workforce has protections in place in order to keep employees from being fired whenever a new administration is elected. The proposed regulation assumes that many federal employees are lazy, incompetent, or otherwise unfit to do their jobs and therefore proposes relaxing the protections currently in place in order to remove these employees from the federal workforce. However, this presumption is false. Most federal employees are hard-working Americans who have dedicated their lives to serving the public. They work just as hard as anyone in the private sector. \n\nThe regulation pretends to care about performance, accountability, and responsiveness, but completely ignores the fact that almost every single agency in the government is being downsized already and performance and responsiveness will, in fact, suffer because of those downsizing efforts. Therefore it feels like this regulation actually has very little to do with performance, accountability, and responsiveness, and more to do with replacing employees who do not voice support for the administration's policies. Replacing knowledgeable, hard working people with yes-men, will not make the government more responsive or performant. ",

The federal workforce has protections in place in order to keep employees from being fired whenever a new administration is elected. The proposed regulation assumes that many federal employees are lazy, incompetent, or otherwise unfit to do their jobs and therefore proposes relaxing the protections currently in place in order to remove these employees from the federal workforce. However, this presumption is false. Most federal employees are hard-working Americans who have dedicated their lives to serving the public. They work just as hard as anyone in the private sector. \n\nThe regulation pretends to care about performance, accountability, and responsiveness, but completely ignores the fact that almost every single agency in the government is being downsized already and performance and responsiveness will, in fact, suffer because of those downsizing efforts. Therefore it feels like this regulation actually has very little to do with performance, accountability, and responsiveness, and more to do with replacing employees who do not voice support for the administration's policies. Replacing knowledgeable, hard working people with yes-men, will not make the government more responsive or performant. ",

While enhancing accountability within the civil service is a commendable goal, certain aspects of this proposal could inadvertently compromise the nonpartisan foundation essential to scientific endeavors and public trust.\n\nThe proposal suggests reclassifying policy-influencing positions into a new \"Schedule Policy/Career\" category, rendering them at-will roles exempt from standard adverse action procedures and appeals. Although these positions are described as remaining career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis, the at-will nature inherently introduces a vulnerability to political influence. This is particularly concerning for scientific agencies like the NIH, where policy decisions must be grounded in rigorous, unbiased research rather than shifting political agendas.\n\nThe ability to remove employees without the usual procedural safeguards could deter scientists from pursuing innovative or controversial research topics, fearing repercussions tied to political sensitivities rather than scientific merit. Such an environment risks stifling scientific progress and undermines the credibility of institutions that rely on objective analysis to inform public health policies.\n\nTo preserve the integrity of scientific research and maintain public confidence in our institutions, I urge a reconsideration of the provisions that allow for at-will employment in policy-influencing positions.

This kind of policy would deal a serious blow to the merit-based civil service system that has kept our federal workforce professional and nonpartisan for well over 100 years.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear\u2014this idea goes completely against the spirit of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. That law was passed to stop the old \u201cspoils system,\u201d where jobs were handed out as political favors, and instead establish a system based on merit. Schedule F would do the opposite\u2014it would allow large numbers of career civil servants, especially those involved in policy, to be reclassified and fired without cause. That opens the door wide to political interference and hiring based on loyalty rather than qualifications or expertise.\n\nIt also violates the due process rights federal workers currently have. Under current law (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513), career employees are supposed to be protected from unjust termination\u2014they deserve fair procedures and a valid reason before being removed. Schedule F throws those protections out the window, weakening both job security and the ability of employees to offer honest, expert advice\u2014even when it\u2019s not politically convenient.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of OPM\u2019s responsibility. The Office of Personnel Management is legally required (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq.) to uphold the merit system principles. Schedule F would force OPM to work against its own mission by placing political pressure on career staff, disrupting the stability and impartiality of federal programs that are meant to last across administrations.\n\nBottom line: Schedule F is a dangerous idea. It threatens good governance, undermines the independence of the civil service, and chips away at the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to stand firm against any attempt to revive or implement it.",

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing.

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification",

    "comment": "I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s proposed rule (Docket OPM-2025-0004; RIN 3206-AO80) to create a new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d excepted-service category for policy-influencing positions. I strongly oppose the retroactive application of this rule to current incumbents and instead urge OPM to limit any reclassification to positions as they become vacant and to new hires going forward.\n\nCareer employees have accumulated a property interest in their civil-service status, including pre-removal notice, hearing rights, and MSPB appeals under Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5, U.S. Code. Stripping these protections en masse violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that no person shall be deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due process of law,\u201d and the Supreme Court has recognized that significant employment-related entitlements constitute such property interests. Retaining protections for incumbents while applying Schedule Policy/Career only prospectively would honor those settled expectations without undermining accountability goals.\n\nCongress narrowly authorized exceptions to civil-service protections for \u201cpositions determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\u201d\u2014i.e., political appointees\u2014not career incumbents. Section 7511(b)(2) of Title 5 confirms that exclusions from Chapter 75 attach to the position\u2019s nature, not to who occupies it. OPM\u2019s attempt to remove protections from existing incumbents therefore exceeds its regulatory authority under the Civil Service Reform Act.\n\nThe Civil Service Reform Act requires that any exception to competitive-service requirements be \u201cnecessary\u201d and warranted by \u201cconditions of good administration\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3302). Retroactively sweeping in current employees en masse cannot satisfy that strict standard, as it neither targets proven instances of serious misconduct nor ensures rigorous, case-by-case determinations by individual agency heads.\n\nUnder the APA, rescinding or revising existing regulations requires the same notice-and-comment procedures used to promulgate them (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553). Yet the proposed rule attempts to render inoperative the Biden-era regulations via a brief NPRM rather than full, reasoned analysis of thousands of comments and empirical data. This approach risks arbitrary and capricious decision-making prohibited by APA \u00a7 706.\n\nI respectfully oppose the entire concept of creating a Schedule Policy/Career excepted-service category, the proposed rule itself, and the accompanying Executive Order. Establishing an at-will layer over career positions politicizes roles that Congress intended to remain nonpartisan, undermines merit-system principles, and eliminates foundational due-process safeguards for thousands of federal employees.\n\nFor these reasons, I urge OPM to withdraw the retroactive reclassification component and the broader Schedule Policy/Career initiative. Civil-service protections should remain intact for current incumbents, with any new accountability measures applied only prospectively to vacated positions and new hires. ",

    "comment": "To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI strongly oppose the proposed rule that would establish a new Schedule Policy/Career employment category. This rule raises serious legal concerns, including direct conflict with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and well-established constitutional due process protections for federal employees.\n\n1. Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301\u20132302)\nThe CSRA enshrines the merit system principles as the cornerstone of federal employment. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(2) states that \"all employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management\u2026 with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights.\"\n\nFurthermore, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 mandates that adverse actions, including removals and suspensions, be carried out only \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\" and requires advance notice, representation, and an opportunity to respond. The proposed Schedule Policy/Career classification unlawfully circumvents these statutory protections by permitting at-will removal without these required procedures.\n\n2. Undermining Constitutional Due Process Rights\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), that public employees with a property interest in their continued employment are entitled to due process before termination. By designating career civil servants as at-will employees and removing their appeal rights, the rule violates this constitutional guarantee.\n\nEven policy-influencing roles do not lose their entitlement to basic procedural protections when filled through competitive, nonpolitical appointments. Attempting to redefine these roles to strip away due process is a de facto repeal of civil service rights without Congressional authorization.\n\n3. Exceeds OPM\u2019s Statutory Authority\nThe proposed rule attempts to unilaterally reclassify large swaths of the workforce and redefine fundamental aspects of federal employment. This oversteps the regulatory authority granted to the Office of Personnel Management under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103, which does not permit wholesale reclassification of employees to evade the merit-based protections mandated by Congress.\n\nCourts have been skeptical of agencies attempting to bypass clear statutory protections through rulemaking. As noted in Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014), \"an agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.\"\n\n4. Risk of Politicization and Retaliation\nThe proposed rule\u2019s stated justification includes removing employees who \u201cundermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\u201d This vague and subjective standard, when combined with at-will status, invites abuse and may be used to purge qualified employees for ideological reasons, not performance\u2014a direct violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(10), which prohibits discrimination based on political affiliation.\n\nConclusion:\nThe proposed rule is not only bad policy but also likely unlawful. It threatens to erode the apolitical nature of the civil service, bypasses core legal protections enshrined in the CSRA and the Constitution, and grants the Executive Branch undue power over career personnel.\n\nI urge OPM to withdraw this proposal in its entirety.",

This policy is misguided, legally questionable, and threatens the nonpartisan integrity of the civil service.\n\nFirst, the proposal undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511), which limits the exception of civil service protections to a narrow category of positions that are \u201cconfidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating.\u201d The proposed rule goes far beyond this intent by opening the door to the mass reclassification of career civil servants without sufficient statutory authority.\n\nSecond, this proposal raises serious constitutional concerns. Federal employees possess a property interest in their continued employment, and reclassifying positions to at-will status without individualized due process may violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. As highlighted in Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41 (2012), federal employees are entitled to meaningful procedural protections and access to redress. Schedule F undermines those principles.\n\nThird, this rule would weaken merit system principles enshrined in federal law, including the requirement that hiring and firing decisions be made based on competence and performance, not political loyalty.

This aligns with the reintroduction of Schedule F, rebranded as Schedule Policy/Career in 2025, aiming to reclassify career employees as at-will, stripping them of merit-based protections. As a union-minded scholar, I oppose this rule for its assault on meritocracy, due process, and labor rights, threatening the integrity of the federal civil service.\nThe federal civil service, rooted in the Pendleton Act of 1883, ensures competence and impartiality, shielding employees from political pressures. The proposed rule undermines this by centralizing authority in the OPM Director, mandating agency compliance within five workdays, and aligning with Schedule F\u2019s agenda to politicize the workforce. Schedule F, introduced in 2020 and revoked in 2021, sought to reclassify employees in policy roles as at-will, enabling dismissals without cause. Its 2025 revival, as noted on X, risks replacing career professionals with loyalists, prioritizing politics over expertise.\nThe rule\u2019s vague criteria for \u201cunsuitable\u201d conduct invite abuse, allowing subjective or politicized removals. This contradicts merit-based principles, where decisions should reflect performance, not loyalty. Centralizing authority bypasses agencies\u2019 contextual knowledge, eroding the decentralized structure that ensures fairness. Historically, suitability determinations balanced agency needs with employee rights; this rule tilts toward arbitrary discipline, undermining trust in governance.\nDue process, a cornerstone of labor law, is gutted by the rule\u2019s five-day compliance mandate, limiting employees\u2019 ability to challenge decisions via the Merit Systems Protection Board or unions. This disproportionately harms unionized workers, whose collective bargaining agreements protect against unjust actions. The rule\u2019s silence on union involvement signals a deliberate sidelining of labor, chilling federal workers\u2019 ability to engage in union activities or exercise First Amendment rights. Such ambiguity risks targeting employees for non-job-related conduct, fostering fear and compliance over independence.\nThe rule operationalizes Schedule F by enabling rapid dismissals of employees deemed misaligned with political priorities. X posts highlight Schedule F as a \u201cdangerous\u201d politicization of public service, undermining agencies\u2019 impartiality. This institutional capture prioritizes partisan agendas, demoralizing workers and reducing expertise in critical areas like public health or environmental protection. The sociological impact\u2014eroding trust in institutions\u2014threatens democratic governance, as politicized agencies may neglect equitable policymaking.\nEconomically, the rule destabilizes federal workers, many supporting families and communities. At-will employment creates uncertainty, disproportionately affecting marginalized groups vulnerable to discriminatory \u201csuitability\u201d interpretations. Socially, a loyalist-driven civil service may prioritize political goals over public needs, exacerbating inequalities in healthcare, poverty, or environmental justice. This betrays the civil service\u2019s oath to the Constitution, not any administration.\nThe rule\u2019s alignment with Schedule F demands its withdrawal. It threatens the meritocratic foundation of the civil service, erodes labor protections, and risks long-term harm to governance. If OPM proceeds, it must: 1) reaffirm merit-based criteria; 2) ensure robust due process with extended timelines and appeals; 3) consult unions to preserve bargaining rights; 4) reject Schedule F\u2019s politicization; and 5) enhance transparency through public hearings.\nFederal employees deserve a system that upholds fairness, not one that sacrifices them to political expediency.

This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "I oppose the proposed regulation OPM-2025-0004, which seeks to reclassify certain federal positions into the new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d category.

The proposed rule\u2019s potential to erode institutional knowledge and expertise could lead to inefficiencies and a decline in the quality of public services.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of clear criteria for reclassification raises concerns about arbitrary or discriminatory implementation.

Reclassifying large numbers of career civil servants\u2014especially those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014would expose them to dismissal without cause. This creates a clear path for politically driven employment decisions, contradicting the core tenet of a politically neutral civil service outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which safeguards employment decisions from partisan influence.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the broad and ambiguous criteria for placing employees under Schedule F are inconsistent with the due process rights granted under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. That statute requires justified cause and procedural fairness in disciplinary actions involving federal employees. Removing these protections would not only compromise accountability but also stifle open dialogue and expert input within agencies, ultimately weakening the effectiveness of public administration.\n\n\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., has a duty to uphold the merit system principles.

That law was put in place to stop the old \u201cspoils system\u201d and make sure federal jobs are awarded based on qualifications, not political connections. But Schedule F would let a huge number of career civil servants\u2014especially folks involved in policy work\u2014get reclassified and possibly fired without any real cause. That opens the door to political loyalty tests, which totally goes against the whole idea of a neutral, professional civil service. Federal law (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8)) clearly says hiring and firing should be based on merit, not politics.\n\nIt also raises big red flags when it comes to due process.

Our foundation of federal government service is predicated on good, hard working, honest people that volunteer to provide our Nation the services needed to effectively care for our fellow Americans. These are underpaid, underappreciated, American federal workers that perform under a variety of stressors, none of which require changing their status to Policy/Career, and the only reason this is being considered is to allow for their immediate termination. Removing the prerequisite protections that federal workers have in regard to not being \"fired at will\", and \"unable to speak truth to authority\" for \"fear of losing their job\", will create a spoils system that will reward unethical, illegal, and immoral behavior and subsequently fail to provide the very services our fellow Americans paid their taxes to receive. In addition to this damaging the American people, allowing this action will directly endanger both serving bureaucrats and politicians by creating this spoils system that will provide multiple opportunities to engage in purposeful sabotage that will result in disastrous (read: fatal) outcomes. All levels of leadership (including appointees) will now have to be aware that \"the one mistake that can be blamed on them will result in their termination\". Coupled with the possibility that in this new environment, there is no foreseeable penalty for an at-will employee if \"one was to sabotage that supervisor to get them fired, making an opening for their own advancement\" due to the spoils system. If the only motivation an employee has is to not get fired, then they will do or make the appearance that they are doing their job at bare minimum, which means that the quality of the work will suffer, leaving them vulnerable to inducements to not do their job. Multiple this mindset by hundreds of thousands of federal workers, with their only concern is not getting fired will ultimately affect every aspect of American life. The lats time this happened, the 25th President William McKinley tried this spoils system in 1897 and was the third U.S. President shot dead in 1901 as a result. Enact this plan and this gilded age will end even worse: not a threat, but a promise to America. ",

Such a proposal represents a fundamental threat to the merit-based framework that has sustained a professional and politically neutral federal workforce for well over a century.\n\nAt its core, Schedule F subverts the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, legislation specifically designed to dismantle the spoils system and replace it with a system grounded in meritocratic hiring and retention. By authorizing the wholesale reclassification of career civil servants\u2014particularly those engaged in policy formulation or analysis\u2014Schedule F effectively enables arbitrary dismissals untethered from cause or performance. This erodes the apolitical nature of the federal workforce, directly contravening the mandates articulated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which codify the requirement that federal personnel decisions be guided solely by merit and shielded from partisan interference.\n\nFurthermore, the broad and imprecise criteria for Schedule F designation pose significant due process concerns. The protections afforded under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which guarantee cause-based removal and procedural safeguards for career federal employees, are effectively nullified under this classification. Such a shift not only compromises individual rights but also has chilling implications for the internal functioning of federal agencies, discouraging candid professional advice and dissent\u2014both of which are essential to sound policymaking and institutional integrity.\n\nThe proposed classification also places the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in direct conflict with its statutory obligations under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., which entrust the agency with the stewardship of the merit system principles. Instituting Schedule F would compel OPM to facilitate politically motivated personnel decisions, thereby undermining the very mission it is charged with upholding.\n\nIn sum, the resurrection of Schedule F represents a profound deviation from the foundational tenets of public administration in the United States. It endangers the independence, competence, and continuity of the civil service and invites a return to politicized governance. I urge the administration and the OPM to reject, without reservation, any regulatory initiative aimed at implementing or reviving this deeply troubling classification.",

I urge the administration and the OPM to reject, without reservation, any regulatory initiative aimed at implementing or reviving this deeply troubling classification.",

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law.

There have never been documented and obvious cases of employee malfeasance or poor performance that did not lead to the relevant employee's ouster. The only way the regulation's proposed purpose makes sense is if you consider an employee's failure to hew to a particular ideological bent as an example of \"poor performance\". Also, this regulation subverts the idea of our government operating as a meritocracy, rather than as a patronage-based system. Plus, it will decimate the institutional knowledge that having secure, long-serving federal employees fostered over the years. As a result, allowing this regulation to stand will do nothing to improve the functionality of our government, while doing grievous and potentially irreversible harm in the process. In other words, it's a terrible idea that any thoughtful American should roundly reject and condemn. ",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

However, this flexibility comes at a serious cost. By reclassifying a significant number of career employees\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014and subjecting them to termination without cause, Schedule F risks replacing expertise with political loyalty. This undermines the principle of an apolitical civil service, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which requires that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence. An administration\u2019s efficiency cannot come at the expense of the constitutional commitment to impartial governance.\nAdvocates also claim that Schedule F would improve accountability by removing underperforming employees more easily. Yet the broad and vague criteria for inclusion in Schedule F contradict the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which require cause and procedural safeguards for removing career federal employees. Stripping these protections weakens\u2014not strengthens\u2014accountability. It could discourage employees from voicing dissenting opinions or providing candid expert advice, ultimately harming the effectiveness of government operations.\nAdditionally, supporters suggest that implementing Schedule F would streamline federal operations by aligning staff more closely with an administration\u2019s goals. But this short-term alignment would come at the expense of long-term stability and continuity in federal programs. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to uphold merit system principles, would be acting against its statutory mission by implementing Schedule F. The result would be undue political pressure on career professionals, threatening the integrity and effectiveness of federal programs across administrations.\nIn summary, while Schedule F may appear to offer greater flexibility and efficiency to the executive branch, its adoption poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this harmful classification\n",

Those who choose to serve our country by using their skills, talents and education by going into government service as opposed to the private sector where they could earn considerably more money should not be penalized.

No, I am more concerned about the deleterious impact on all of us. Government employees often have specialized and institutional knowledge that is irreplaceable, or at least is very costly to replace. Of course, people should be fired for cause for instance if they've broken regulations or laws or acted unconstitutionally.

    "comment": "During the 19th Century, federal employment was rife with corruption; employees obtained or retained their jobs based not on merit or competence, but on their political affiliation. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) established the current merit-based system in the federal workforce, outlining protections and expectations for a federal employee, while also defining exceptions, such as the historically and realistically miniscule group of political employees. The proposed rule seeks to expand \"political appointee\" to include career employees, stripping them of the protections they have enjoyed since 1978. I am concerned that this rule will inevitably lead to federal employment populated by people retained exclusively for their loyalty or connections to individuals rather than to the mission of supporting all Americans through the government made by the People and for the People. Furthermore, the CSRA does not extend to the President the power to strip career employees of their protections under CSRA, but only political appointees. For the definition of a political appointee, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 9803(c)(2)(A) \"the term 'political appointee' means an employee who holds a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\", 7 U.S.C \u00a7 6992(e)(2)(D) \"the term 'political appointee' means an individual occupying a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\" and 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 725(c) \"The term 'political appointee' means any employee [...] who holds a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\" There is extensive legal precedent, with commentary on the spirit and intent of CSRA from the Supreme Court and Congress itself. Under constitutional and statutory interpretation, ultimately Schedule F is unlawful, if politically convenient. It is my hope that our great Government upholds the rule of law and protects our career civil servants so that federal employment does not become like those seen in adversarial countries, where knowing the right person or currying political favor are the sole keys to success and corruption abounds.",
    "original_comment": "During the 19th Century, federal employment was rife with corruption; employees obtained or retained their jobs based not on merit or competence, but on their political affiliation. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) established the current merit-based system in the federal workforce, outlining protections and expectations for a federal employee, while also defining exceptions, such as the historically and realistically miniscule group of political employees. The proposed rule seeks to expand \"political appointee\" to include career employees, stripping them of the protections they have enjoyed since 1978. I am concerned that this rule will inevitably lead to federal employment populated by people retained exclusively for their loyalty or connections to individuals rather than to the mission of supporting all Americans through the government made by the People and for the People. Furthermore, the CSRA does not extend to the President the power to strip career employees of their protections under CSRA, but only political appointees. For the definition of a political appointee, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 9803(c)(2)(A) \"the term 'political appointee' means an employee who holds a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\", 7 U.S.C \u00a7 6992(e)(2)(D) \"the term 'political appointee' means an individual occupying a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\" and 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 725(c) \"The term 'political appointee' means any employee [...] who holds a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\" There is extensive legal precedent, with commentary on the spirit and intent of CSRA from the Supreme Court and Congress itself.

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law.

    "comment": "While I support the goal of enhancing performance and accountability in government, I strongly oppose this rule as written. By creating a new Schedule Policy/Career within the excepted service and exempting those employees from the adverse action procedures and appeals protections under 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 and 75, this proposal fundamentally undermines the nonpartisan merit-based civil service established under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA).\n\nThe CSRA was enacted to ensure that employees are \u201cprotected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes\u201d and to uphold an effective and efficient merit-based civil service (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)). This proposed rule reverses those principles by designating certain career positions as effectively at-will, subject to removal without meaningful procedural safeguards. This would significantly weaken civil service protections that have been in place for decades, diminishing the neutrality and continuity of our federal workforce.\n\nAdditionally, by shifting a broad class of career positions into an at-will category that can be easily reshaped by each incoming administration, this rule risks triggering cyclical, large-scale turnover every four to eight years. Such turnover would deplete institutional knowledge and discourage long-term public service careers. It would also erode the impartiality that is essential to maintaining public trust in the implementation of laws and policies.\n\nAlthough the proposed rule maintains that these positions will be filled on a nonpartisan basis, the reality is that removing traditional appeal rights and due process protections opens the door to politicized removals and the perception thereof. Even the best-intentioned leaders cannot prevent such perceptions when protections are removed, particularly in politically sensitive policy areas.\n\nIn conclusion, while the desire to streamline personnel actions is understandable, it must not come at the expense of the core values of a professional, stable, and impartial federal civil service. I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw or substantially revise this proposed rule and instead seek solutions that maintain accountability while preserving the integrity of the merit system as envisioned in the CSRA.",

    "comment": "The proposed Schedule F classification raises significant legal concerns as it violates multiple federal statutes and constitutional protections designed to uphold a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service. Below is the detailed analysis of the legal issues associated with Schedule F:\n\n1. Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)\nThe CSRA establishes a merit-based system for federal employment, providing protections against arbitrary dismissal. Schedule F seeks to reclassify certain policy-influencing positions, effectively removing these protections and allowing for at-will termination. Reclassification undermines the CSRA\u2019s intent and structure. Notably, the CSRA permits exceptions for positions of a \u201cconfidential or policy-determining character,\u201d but Schedule F\u2019s broad application exceeds this narrow scope. The Roth v.

    "original_comment": "The proposed Schedule F classification raises significant legal concerns as it violates multiple federal statutes and constitutional protections designed to uphold a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service. Below is the detailed analysis of the legal issues associated with Schedule F:\n\n1. Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)\nThe CSRA establishes a merit-based system for federal employment, providing protections against arbitrary dismissal. Schedule F seeks to reclassify certain policy-influencing positions, effectively removing these protections and allowing for at-will termination. Reclassification undermines the CSRA\u2019s intent and structure. Notably, the CSRA permits exceptions for positions of a \u201cconfidential or policy-determining character,\u201d but Schedule F\u2019s broad application exceeds this narrow scope. The Roth v. Brownell decision reinforces that reclassification cannot strip employees of their CSRA protections without due process.\n \n2. Contravention of the Lloyd\u2013La Follette Act of 1912\nThis Act mandates that federal employees cannot be removed without notice and a written explanation.

Truly, nothing has advanced the cause of government accountability quite like replacing specialists with people who once made a viral TikTok about patriotism.\n\nLet me catch you up on how things are going.\n\nAfter the Department of Civil Engineering was restructured into the Department of Vibes and Gut Feelings, we saw real change. Sure, several major bridges were reclassified as \u201cemotional support infrastructure\u201d and subsequently collapsed, but the response was quick: a bipartisan task force was formed to blame the media.\n\nAt the Federal Aviation Agency (now just called \u201cSky Stuff, Inc.\u201d), we found that pilots trained via PowerPoint and positive affirmations cost 63 percent less. And while yes, airline safety ratings plummeted, so did flight cancellations\u2014because we stopped keeping track.\n\nThe FDA is currently being run by a wellness coach named Derek who believes bacteria are a mindset. He recently approved an energy drink called \u201cRaw Beef Xtreme\u201d as both a beverage and a prescription medication. We no longer have to worry about side effects because we legally redefined them as \u201cunexpected benefits.\u201d\n\nBank regulation has been streamlined. The old stress tests were replaced with a one-question form that asks: \u201cDo you feel confident?\u201d Institutions that answer \u201cyes\u201d are considered stable. Those that answer \u201cno\u201d are considered disloyal and asked to reapply with better energy.\n\nNASA merged with a YouTube channel run by someone named StarJacker27. His qualifications include believing gravity is a suggestion and referring to satellites as \u201cspace fidgets.\u201d We haven\u2019t launched anything in years, but we have launched several press conferences, which is kind of the same.\n\nThe Merit Systems Protection Board was replaced by a comment box labeled \u201cSnitches Get Ditches.\u201d\n\nYou might ask, was all this worth it? And the answer is clear: yes, absolutely, if your goal was to ensure no one with actual expertise dares speak up again. Mission accomplished.\n\nStill, there are a few minor issues. We no longer have running water in four states, our cybersecurity response is managed via group text, and the national debt is now measured in bitcoin memes. But morale is up\u2014at least according to the people still allowed to speak.\n\nSo thank you, OPM, for finally doing away with the outdated notion that people who write laws or inspect power plants or oversee nuclear material need job protections. That was so 20th century. Who needs merit when you can have loyalty and a LinkedIn profile that says \u201cInfluencer\u201d?\n\nSincerely,\nA citizen from 2028\nP.S. Please send engineers. Real ones.

    "comment": "This proposed rule is just the latest in a series of calculated moves by the 47th administration to amass - and inevitably abuse - unearned political power. Federal employees, by and large, are mission-driven. They are motivated primarily by a desire to do good work that will benefit the American people, despite knowing those who will benefit most will likely never know, understand, or appreciate the work they do. The very proposal of a rule like this makes it clear that service to others and acting in the interest of the public good are foreign concepts to this administration. No reasonable person with an honest, good faith interest in democratic governance or improving the effectiveness of the American civil service (at least, for anyone aside from the sitting president and perhaps a handful of lackeys who are long on greed and short on integrity) supports this.",

This measure poses a serious threat to the integrity, stability, and apolitical nature of the federal civil service.\n\nThe Schedule F designation undermines the core principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which created a merit-based system to insulate federal hiring from political patronage. Allowing broad reclassification of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014opens the door to politically motivated hiring and terminations. This fundamentally conflicts with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be merit-based and shielded from political influence.\n\nThe proposal also violates essential due process protections under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 by enabling removals without cause or procedural safeguards. Such changes risk silencing technical expertise and discouraging dissent within federal agencies\u2014undermining the analytical rigor and integrity of policymaking.\n\nAdditionally, the Office of Personnel Management has a statutory mandate under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to uphold merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F would contradict this mission, compromising the neutrality and continuity of government operations across administrations.\n\nPolicymakers should reject Schedule F as a clear deviation from long-standing norms that ensure a capable, impartial, and professional civil service. This proposal threatens not only the stability of the workforce but also the trust the American public places in its government institutions.\n\nWe all should stand against any regulatory or executive effort to advance this dangerous framework.\n",

    "comment": "Subject: Public Comment Opposing OPM Proposed Rule 2025-004\n\n\nI write to express deep concern regarding OPM\u2019s proposed rule (OPM-2025-004), which purports to enhance accountability within the civil service by creating a new employment category for certain policy-influencing roles. While accountability is an important goal, this rule risks politicizing the civil service and weakening the foundations of impartial governance that have served our democracy for over a century.\n\n1. Threat to Civil Service Neutrality:\nThe rule creates ambiguity around what constitutes a \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d position, and opens the door to discretionary and potentially politically motivated removals. This fundamentally undermines the principle of a nonpartisan civil service. Career federal employees must be able to offer honest, evidence-based guidance to leadership\u2014regardless of political climate\u2014without fear of reprisal.\n\n2. Chilling Effect on Public Servants:\nThe prospect of being removed for subjective or ideologically driven reasons may deter federal employees from providing critical but politically inconvenient information. This chilling effect degrades policy-making and weakens government oversight functions.\n\n3. Risk to Institutional Knowledge and Continuity:\nFederal employees in policy-advisory roles often possess years\u2014sometimes decades\u2014of institutional knowledge. Sweeping removals in these roles threaten the long-term effectiveness of agencies, especially in complex fields like national security, public health, and regulatory enforcement.\n\n4. Erosion of Public Trust:\nThe public depends on a professional and apolitical federal workforce. Perceptions of increased political interference in the civil service will diminish public confidence in government decisions, enforcement actions, and policy execution.\n\n5. Disincentive for Talent Recruitment and Retention:\nThis rule may deter talented individuals from pursuing public service, knowing their careers could hinge not on performance or ethics, but on political alignment. That is antithetical to the merit-based ideals OPM is charged with upholding.\n\nIn summary, while efforts to improve government performance are commendable, this rule appears to prioritize political loyalty over professional excellence and nonpartisan service. I urge OPM to withdraw or substantially revise this rule to ensure it aligns with the foundational values of merit, neutrality, and long-term institutional resilience.\n\n\n\n",

This proposal would strike at the heart of the merit\u2010based civil service system that has ensured a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce since the Pendleton Act was passed in 1883.\n\nUnder that landmark reform, hiring and promotion in the federal government became tied to objective measures of competence rather than political allegiance.  By designating large swaths of policy analysts, program managers, inspectors and other career staff as \u201cSchedule F,\u201d the administration could strip them of long-standing due-process protections, reclassify them at will, and terminate them without cause\u2014effectively reinstating the very spoils-system abuses that Pendleton and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) were meant to abolish.  Such a move would conflict directly with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which requires that federal employment decisions rest solely on merit and be insulated from partisan pressure.\n\nMoreover, resurrecting Schedule F would undermine institutional knowledge and discourage top-flight professionals from entering or remaining in public service.  It would chill candid analysis and weaken agencies\u2019 ability to offer neutral, data-driven advice, ultimately eroding public trust in government.  In 2020, an executive order first established Schedule F; it was revoked the following year in recognition of these risks.  Reviving it now would not only reverse that sound judgment but also set a dangerous precedent for politicized personnel management in every corner of the federal establishment.",

    "comment": "I have several concern regarding the rule for the functioning of Science in the US as follows:\n1. Potential for Political Interference: If scientific positions are classified as \"policy-influencing,\" scientists could be more vulnerable to removal for disagreeing with or challenging political agendas. This could lead to scientists tailoring their findings or recommendations to align with the administration's views, rather than presenting objective, evidence-based conclusions.\n\n2. Decreased Scientific Integrity: The fear of reprisal could discourage scientists from conducting or publishing research that contradicts the prevailing political narrative. This could undermine scientific integrity and lead to the suppression or manipulation of scientific information.\n\n3. Loss of Expertise and Institutional Knowledge: Frequent turnover in scientific positions due to at-will employment could result in a loss of expertise and institutional knowledge within government agencies. This could hinder long-term research projects, data collection, and the development of effective science-based policies.\n\n4. Reduced Scientific Independence: If scientists are more easily removed for their views or findings, their independence could be compromised. This could lead to a decline in public trust in government science and the perception that scientific decisions are being driven by politics rather than evidence.\n\n5. Difficulty Attracting and Retaining Top Scientists: The uncertainty and potential for political interference associated with at-will employment could make it more difficult for government agencies to attract and retain top scientists. This could weaken the scientific capacity of the government and its ability to address critical issues.",

    "comment": "A bedrock principle of our republic is a professional and nonpartisan civil service, a system carefully constructed on merit since the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883. The proposed \"Schedule F\" classification poses a significant threat to this enduring foundation. By potentially allowing the reclassification and dismissal without cause of a broad spectrum of career civil servants, particularly those engaged in crucial policy formulation and analysis, this initiative opens a dangerous pathway for political considerations to unduly influence hiring and firing decisions. This directly contravenes the spirit and letter of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which clearly mandates that federal employment decisions must be rooted in merit-based principles, shielded from the vagaries of political influence.\n\nFurthermore, the imprecise and expansive criteria for inclusion under \"Schedule F\" raise serious concerns regarding the fundamental due process protections currently afforded to career federal employees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. These established safeguards require just cause and adherence to procedural fairness before the removal of dedicated public servants. To strip potentially thousands of these individuals of such essential protections not only weakens the mechanisms of accountability within our government but also creates a chilling effect on the willingness of experts to offer candid advice and dissenting opinions, ultimately undermining the operational effectiveness of our governmental institutions.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) also bears a statutory responsibility, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., to vigorously support and uphold the principles of the merit system. The implementation of \"Schedule F\" stands in direct contradiction to this vital statutory mission. It would subject career professionals to undue political pressures, thereby compromising the integrity and the essential continuity of federal programs that serve the American people across different administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Schedule F\" proposal represents a grave danger to the fundamental tenets of sound governance, the cherished independence of our civil service, and the overarching rule of law. It is my considered and firm conviction that the current administration and the Office of Personnel Management must resolutely reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this ill-conceived and potentially damaging classification.",

It allows partisan politics to hold sway over our federal government workforce instead of a merit based since it allows a large number of federal employees, many who have served our government for their entire career, to be fired without cause.

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing.

Allowing broad reclassification of positions undermines these principles, potentially leading to appointments based on political affiliation rather than qualifications.\u200b\n\nThreat to Nonpartisan Expertise: Federal employees provide critical, nonpartisan expertise essential for informed policymaking. Reclassifying positions could suppress dissenting opinions and discourage honest analysis, impairing the government's ability to serve the public effectively.\u200b\n\nLegal and Administrative Challenges: The previous implementation of similar provisions under EO 13957 faced significant legal scrutiny and was ultimately revoked. Reintroducing such measures may lead to renewed legal challenges, causing instability and uncertainty within federal agencies.\u200b\n\nNegative Impact on Employee Morale: The potential for arbitrary reclassification and removal can demoralize the federal workforce, leading to decreased productivity and challenges in attracting and retaining skilled professionals.\u200b\n\nConclusion:\n\nMaintaining a merit-based civil service is crucial for the effective and impartial functioning of our government.

    "comment": "Subject: Opposition to OPM-2025-0004-0001 \u2013 Protect Civil Service Independence from Political Loyalty Tests\n\nI write in strong opposition to the proposed rule OPM-2025-0004-0001, which would open the door to reintroducing mechanisms similar to those under former Executive Order 13957. This rule risks politicizing the federal workforce by allowing the reclassification of career civil servants into a category of employees who can be hired and fired without the usual merit-based protections.\n\nAt the heart of my concern is the threat this proposal poses to the independence and integrity of the civil service. If enacted, the rule would enable the executive branch to subject career officials to implicit or explicit loyalty tests, requiring alignment with the political priorities of the President rather than adherence to law, science, and the public interest.\n\nKey Issues:\n\nEncouraging Loyalty over Expertise:\nThe reclassification of positions removes critical due process protections, effectively allowing political appointees to dismiss civil servants based on perceived loyalty rather than competence or adherence to ethical obligations. This creates a chilling effect where employees may feel pressured to conform politically to avoid retaliation or termination.\n\nUndermining Nonpartisan Governance:\nCivil servants are obligated to serve the public and uphold the Constitution\u2014not to serve the personal or political interests of any one administration. Weakening their independence by tying job security to political loyalty erodes the public\u2019s trust in an impartial government.\n\nHistorical Precedent and Rejection:\nA similar framework was widely criticized and ultimately revoked in the past because it posed such an obvious risk to democratic norms and accountable governance. Reintroducing this idea\u2014especially after its rejection\u2014threatens to normalize a dangerous precedent.\n\nStability and Continuity in Government:\nOur nation depends on a stable, professional civil service that can endure across administrations. Allowing widespread reclassification risks turning expert agencies into echo chambers, reducing their ability to provide honest, evidence-based policy guidance.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis proposed rule is not about reform\u2014it is about control. We must not allow a return to a system where public servants are forced to pass political loyalty tests to keep their jobs. I urge OPM to preserve the integrity of the civil service by withdrawing this proposal and upholding the principles of impartial, merit-based government employment.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.",

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nAs a government supervisor, there are multiple tools and processes at my disposal to reprimand or remove an employee. Further, there are similar tools and process to ensure that all individuals get a fair shake. Getting rid of the something that forces a merit-based system seems counter intuitive to the current administrations policies.\n\nThe creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles.

Federal agencies are delegated this power to remain unbiased in regards to political pressures and, should this proposed rule pass, Schedule F would erode the separation between elected leadership and the professional workforce that carries out the law.

As discussed in Administrative Procedures as Instruments of Political Control, when any administration gains the ability to easily intervene and control the decisions of bureaucratic agencies, it opens the door for these agencies to be used for political gain (McCubbins et al.). This threatens the safeguards in place to protect against corruption and manipulation, compromising the independence of the bureaucracy and its ability to act impartially in the public interest. Passing this rule would set a precedent that would both diminish the credibility of our federal agencies and threaten our democracy as a whole.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement this dangerous classification.\nAlso, please remember, these are American lives and livelihoods that will be affected by this change. Federal workers love their country and the American people who they serve. They should ultimately be accountable to the American people and should follow the laws of the land, not the preferences of one administration or the other.

    "comment": "This order wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees and at-will workers to career staff; deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired; and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.  It is a dangerous step backward to a political spoils system that Congress expressly rejected 142 years ago. \n\nStaff of the federal agencies secure the nation, safeguard the public health, promote economic growth and protect consumers from fraud. Their jobs require training and expertise in their chosen field so as to provide the best possible service to all Americans, not passing a political loyalty test.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management established additional safeguards for employees in the event of an executive action like this and those regulations became final in May 2024.  This order has no right to circumvent these regulations.\n\nCivil servants should be focused on their tasks to deliver for the American people and must be protected from arbitrary replacement based on political ideologies, and the corruption that can result from reclassifying them in the same category as political appointees.  The expertise of career civil servants has value and the regulations protecting their employment must not be stripped away to make places for political loyalists who may lack the same expertise and experience of the staff they replace.  The partisan interference that this order advocates in the staffing of federal agencies must be blocked in order to not impair the functioning of these agencies.   Career Federal employees deserve better protection against this treatment and stability in their careers, and they have it in OPM regulations that this order ignores.  The American people deserve agencies staffed with experienced workers that work for their benefit.  This order would strip away their job security and open up the likelihood of being replaced by less qualified staff in order to assert politcal control over the functioning of these agencies.\n\nOpposing this is foundational to how we can ensure that the government delivers for people.  That is what a democracy is about.\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\n24982 Federal Register/Vol. 89, No. 69/Tuesday, April 9, 2024/Rules and Regulations\nOFFICE OF PERSONNEL VI.

    "original_comment": "This order wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees and at-will workers to career staff; deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired; and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.  It is a dangerous step backward to a political spoils system that Congress expressly rejected 142 years ago. \n\nStaff of the federal agencies secure the nation, safeguard the public health, promote economic growth and protect consumers from fraud. Their jobs require training and expertise in their chosen field so as to provide the best possible service to all Americans, not passing a political loyalty test.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management established additional safeguards for employees in the event of an executive action like this and those regulations became final in May 2024.  This order has no right to circumvent these regulations.\n\nCivil servants should be focused on their tasks to deliver for the American people and must be protected from arbitrary replacement based on political ideologies, and the corruption that can result from reclassifying them in the same category as political appointees.  The expertise of career civil servants has value and the regulations protecting their employment must not be stripped away to make places for political loyalists who may lack the same expertise and experience of the staff they replace.  The partisan interference that this order advocates in the staffing of federal agencies must be blocked in order to not impair the functioning of these agencies.   Career Federal employees deserve better protection against this treatment and stability in their careers, and they have it in OPM regulations that this order ignores.  The American people deserve agencies staffed with experienced workers that work for their benefit.  This order would strip away their job security and open up the likelihood of being replaced by less qualified staff in order to assert politcal control over the functioning of these agencies.\n\nOpposing this is foundational to how we can ensure that the government delivers for people.  That is what a democracy is about.",

This proposal endangers the merit-based civil service system that has sustained a competent, impartial federal workforce for more than a hundred years.\n\nAt its core, Schedule F directly conflicts with the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was designed to eliminate the patronage system and promote merit-based hiring in the federal government. By allowing a significant number of career civil servants\u2014especially those engaged in policy work\u2014to be reclassified and potentially dismissed without just cause, Schedule F paves the way for politically driven employment decisions. This contradicts the principle of a politically neutral civil service, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which requires that hiring and firing decisions be based on merit, not political affiliation.\n\nAdditionally, the overly broad and ambiguous standards for placing employees under Schedule F run afoul of the due process protections in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which guarantees cause and fair procedures before career employees can be removed. Taking away these safeguards from thousands of public servants would not only erode accountability but could also discourage candid advice and dissent, weakening the effectiveness of federal agencies.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM), governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., has a legal duty to uphold the merit system principles. Instituting Schedule F would undermine this mandate and expose federal employees to excessive political pressure, ultimately jeopardizing the stability and impartiality of government programs from one administration to the next.\n\nIn summary, Schedule F represents a serious threat to the core values of good governance, civil service neutrality, and the rule of law.

    "comment": "The federal civil service examination was put in place precisely because the executive branch (primarily through Andrew Jackson, but others as well) abused the civil service by putting in place only people loyal to them (the spoils system). Removing highly qualified employees at the whim of the executive, and allowing said executive to appoint unqualified individuals simply because of their loyalty will severely impact the civil service's ability to perform its stated duties. The proposed change will endanger us in a variety of ways, including our current health and well being, as well as our future health and well being (the impact on science will be tremendously negative if unqualified individuals are allowed to lead scientific agencies). The civil service is meant to serve us, the American people, not the executive branch specifically. It is the American people, not the president, who pay the civil service salaries and thus these positions must have a level of independence from the executive branch in order to ensure that they are serving the people and not only the president. It is impossible for the executive to be an expert in all things, and the civil service plays an important role in keeping the executive from making terrible mistakes in areas in which they have no expertise. Additionally the civil service ensures continuity between different administrations for the American people, allowing the federal government to continue to operate smoothly and effectively during transitional periods.

    "comment": "I am a former Federal Employee and have grave concerns over these suggested changes.\n\n1. Undermines Merit-Based System: Creating such a Schedule Policy/Career for policy-influencing career positions risks politicizing career civil service roles. By prioritizing \"accountability to the President\" over merit-based principles, it could erode the impartiality and professionalism of the federal workforce, weakening public trust in government institutions.\n\n2. Reduces Employee Protections: Amending 5 CFR parts 752 and 432 to exclude Schedule Policy/Career employees from the procedural protections under chapters 75 and 43 removes critical safeguards against arbitrary adverse actions or performance-based removals. This could lead to unfair treatment, reduced morale, and increased vulnerability to political pressure.\n\n3. Creates Confusion in Service Classification: The amendments to 5 CFR parts 212 and 213 blur the lines between competitive and excepted service by allowing employees to retain competitive status while in excepted positions. This creates administrative complexity, inconsistency in hiring and management practices, and many potential legal disputes over employee rights and status.\n\n4. Reverses Recent Reforms Without Justification: Rescinding the April 2024 rule\u2019s amendments (e.g., clarifying policy-influencing positions as non-career and imposing procedural requirements) without clear evidence of the failure of those amendments undermines regulatory stability. It disregards the rationale behind those reforms, which likely aimed to protect career employees from politicization.\n\n5. Risks Inconsistent Hiring Practices: Allowing positions moved to Schedule Policy/Career to retain their prior hiring procedures (competitive or excepted) creates a patchwork system. This could lead to inequities in recruitment, hinder workforce mobility, and complicate compliance with federal hiring standards.\n\nIn total, these changes could destabilize the federal workforce, erode protections, and prioritize political influence over merit, ultimately harming government efficiency and public trust.  Should I ever decide to return to the public service workforce, would I be subject to a test of my Knowledge, Skills and Abilities? Or, instead, would I be subject to a political questionnaire?  Would my job and all of my work be terminated and erased with every new administration (as is currently being done with cancer research via the cancellation of research programs that the US taxpayers have already authorized)?\n\nThis series of suggested changes destabilizes my confidence in the effectiveness of the US Government in addition to any confidence in job security in returning to the Federal workforce.\n",

    "comment": "I write in strong support of the proposed Office of Personnel Management Rule, Upholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles, RIN 3206\u2013AO56, Docket ID: OPM\u20132023\u20130013. The proposed rule iprovides essential protections against the dangers posed by politicization. The previously signed Schedule F Executive Order represents the greatest threat to the system of merit embedded in the American civil service system since its inception.\n\nInsecurity and politicization makes public service less attractive, leading to chaos and higher turnover of experienced civil servants.\nPublic officials with career protections are more likely to follow their oath to uphold the constitution, accept democratic values like transparency, and ensure that statutory goals are implemented. Public officials selected because of loyalty to a particular leader are less likely to do so. \n\nPlease uphold impartiality in civil service! \n",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "Here's why many citizens on both sides of the political discretion, are critical of this proposed rule, drawing on legal and policy arguments:\n1. Undermining Merit-Based Hiring and Promotion:\n * Legal Basis: The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 et seq.) established a merit-based system for federal employment, emphasizing qualifications, competence, and political neutrality. This system aims to prevent patronage and ensure a skilled and professional civil service.\n * The Issue with Proposed Schedule F: Critics argue that creating a new Schedule F, which would reclassify certain federal employees as \"excepted service\" and remove some of their civil service protections, could open the door to political influence in hiring and firing. Positions could be filled based on political affiliation or loyalty rather than merit, potentially leading to a less qualified and less effective workforce.\n * Source: The principles of merit-based employment are central to the CSRA and have been consistently upheld in legal interpretations and government policy. The proposed Schedule F is seen by many as a direct challenge to these principles.\n2. Diminishing Job Security and Due Process Rights:\n * Legal Basis: Current federal employees in the competitive service have certain due process rights, including protections against arbitrary dismissal and the right to appeal adverse actions (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513). These protections are designed to ensure fairness and prevent politically motivated removals.\n * The Issue with Proposed Schedule F: Reclassifying employees under a new Schedule F could significantly weaken or eliminate these job security protections. Employees in these positions might be easier to fire without cause, potentially leading to a chilling effect on their willingness to provide candid advice or challenge political directives. This could also lead to instability and a loss of institutional knowledge within federal agencies.\n * Source: The procedural protections afforded to competitive service employees are well-established in federal law and regulations. The proposed Schedule F seeks to create a category of employees with fewer such protections.\n3. Potential for Political Purges and Instability:\n * Policy Argument: Opponents fear that a new Schedule F could be used by future administrations to conduct politically motivated purges of the federal workforce, replacing experienced professionals with individuals more aligned with the current political agenda. This could disrupt the continuity of government operations and erode public trust in the impartiality of federal agencies.\n * Source: Historical examples of political patronage systems and the rationale behind the CSRA highlight the risks associated with weakening merit-based protections.\n4. Negative Impact on Federal Workforce Expertise and Effectiveness:\n * Policy Argument: A federal workforce subject to political volatility and reduced job security could experience lower morale, increased turnover, and difficulty attracting and retaining highly qualified individuals. The loss of experienced professionals could undermine the expertise and effectiveness of federal agencies in carrying out their critical missions.\n * Source: Studies on public sector management and the importance of a stable and professional civil service support the idea that weakening job security can negatively impact workforce quality and organizational performance.\n5. Circumventing Congressional Intent:\n * Legal/Policy Argument: Some argue that creating a broad new excepted service category like Schedule F could be seen as an attempt by the executive branch to circumvent the intent of Congress in establishing the competitive service and its protections. Changes to the civil service system have historically involved legislative action.\n * Source: The history of civil service reform in the U.S. demonstrates the significant role of Congress in shaping the structure and protections of the federal workforce.\nIn Conclusion (Regarding OPM-2025-0004):\nThe proposed Schedule F under OPM-2025-0004 is considered a \"terrible idea\" by many due to its potential to:\n * Politicize the federal workforce.\n * Undermine merit-based principles.\n * Weaken job security and due process rights for federal employees.\n * Create instability and the risk of political purges.\n * Harm the expertise and effectiveness of federal agencies.\n * Potentially circumvent congressional intent regarding the civil service system.\nThese concerns are rooted in legal frameworks like the Civil Service Reform Act and policy considerations regarding the importance of a nonpartisan, professional, and stable federal workforce for effective governance.

Making their employment \"at-will\" flies in the face of the trust that Americans place in their government to engage in a calm, dedicated, and clear process to evaluate government employees. Any provision to \"will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\" is antithetical to the proper apolitical and expert functioning of government service and puts the civil service at risk for being warped and subverted for political purposes.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

Second, it runs the risk of creating an entire civil service beholden to the President, rather than to the rule of law or the mission of the agency they serve. Employees faced with the idea of being fired for not complying with an order, no matter how illegal, would be significantly more likely to commit illegal, potentially criminal, acts for fear of losing their jobs if they do not. No employee should work under fear of a retaliatory firing for attempts to serve the American people honorably. Third, there is a reason that political appointees and civil servants are differentiated between in status. This proposed rule would essentially transform all federal employees to political appointees, subject to be fired at will by the executive. A federal workforce unable to properly serve their agency mission for fear of reprisal, or unable to stand up to illegal orders, or unable to defend their agency's mission from attack is not an effective workforce. I fear that this proposed rule would lead to a lawless executive and an ineffective civil service, both changes that would have sweeping consequences that would take years, if not decades, to fix. ",

Civil service protections have given us a federal bureaucracy that is largely free of the corruption seen in \"3rd world\" countries.

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

It\u2019s been months and not all agencies have a director yet, and how long will it take if an incoming administration fires all at will managerial employees upon taking office to replace them? Every administration could see a new set of employees that need to learn the processes which takes time and effort from the existing staff to teach them. It means a loss of experience and a loss of continuity. We have a reliable, not corrupt bureaucracy that has allowed companies to trust in the stability of America. This would further imperil that stability and trust. Government employees join government to spend their career there serving the public. They serve the public whichever party is in power. They do so with the understanding that as long as they perform satisfactorily, they have job security. Without job security, there is no reason for employee loyalty. I oppose this regulation as it would damage the government\u2019s ability to effectively serve the public and attract talent that is dedicated to the mission. ",

    "comment": "This proposed change would be especially problematic for federal employees. Changing management to Schedule F would make those positions at will for any current or future administration.  This would discourage any federal employee from considering a management position due to the job instability. Most management positions in federal service are not directly related to policy and simply enact regulation and the tasks or projects that the current administration wants to focus on. Furthermore, this would lead to detrimental disruptions in federal agencies being able to serve the American people and the goals of the various programs. Management is typically a GS-13 or higher. Attaining this GS level takes several years, or at least 10 years to even be considered for a GS-13 and above. Thus a majority of staff do not have this GS level. If management was changed to schedule F and subsequently fired, it is very likely that no one will be able to take their position. Any signatures or internal review would not happen and progress would stagnate. I ask of our policy makers to explain how this proposal has any chance of benefiting federal workers ability to serve the government and our country. ",

    "comment": "I am a postdoctoral scholar working in a laboratory located within one of the top research universities in the world. Decreasing protections for civil servants, as would be the case if Schedule F initiative were enacted would be greatly detrimental to the continuance of excellent and rigorous science, for which the United States is known worldwide. Civil Servants -- like those within the NIH, NSF, DoD, DOE, NASA, NWS, NOAA, FDA, USDA, etc -- have dedicated their lives to the continual function and efficiency of our government and we should be eternally grateful for their service. The replacement of civil servants with political appointees would be wholly inefficient and cause incredible disruptions to many elements of USGov including but not limited to scientific innovation through research universities. Politics aside, replacing civil servants with political appointees would require incredible amounts of onboarding and training, slowing down government proceedings. Additionally, the institutionalized knowledge that each civil servant provides is not simply replaceable and much of that knowledge will be lost with the firing of current civil servants. Increased onboarding and training, as well as knowledge loss, will represent a huge amount of time and monetary strain on our government to simply maintain procedures which we already have which are working smoothly at this point. Furthermore, enacting of a Schedule F initiative could be considered a dramatic step in the direction of fascism and at the very least considered a demonstration of government overreach. I urge all government officials to fight against the Schedule F initiative and preserve what level of government efficiency we have remaining.  ",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees.

The rule would remove these positions from the procedural protections of 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 and 75, thereby significantly affecting the due process rights of thousands of federal employees. Given the substantial implications of these changes\u2014for employee rights, agency operations, and the merit-based foundations of the civil service\u2014it is critical that stakeholders have adequate time to analyze the proposal and submit meaningful comments.\n\nExecutive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) requires that significant regulatory actions allow \u201cno less than 60 days\u201d for public comment in most cases.

The absence of adverse action procedures or appeals creates an environment ripe for potential abuse and arbitrary dismissals. Employees may now live in fear of being removed not solely for misconduct or poor performance but also for ideological differences or merely crossing paths with supervisory agendas. This lack of job security can lead to a stifling atmosphere that discourages innovation, dissent, and the voice of experienced professionals who need a platform to provide critical insights and opinions that could enhance policy decisions.\n     It's also crucial to consider the implications of what defines \"misconduct\" or \"poor performance.\" The subjective nature of these terms can lead to inconsistencies in how different supervisors may apply them. Without standardized criteria and robust oversight, the potential for discrimination, favoritism, or political bias in the termination process increases significantly. The very essence of fairness in employment might be compromised, undermining trust in the institution as a whole.\n     Finally, insisting that policy-influencing positions remain nonpartisan while simultaneously creating a landscape that can lead to political overreach is contradictory. Employees in these roles must feel secure enough to perform their duties independently, without the threat of political reprisal.

    "comment": "I strongly oppose any effort to implement Schedule F, a proposed federal employment classification that threatens the integrity, impartiality, and effectiveness of the U.S. civil service.\n\nSchedule F, as introduced by the current administration would allow broad reclassification of federal employees involved in \"policy-determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating\" roles, stripping them of their due process and merit-based civil service protections. This reclassification would open the door to mass politicization of the civil service, undermining a foundational principle of American democracy: that government professionals serve the public interest\u2014not the political interest of any one administration.\n\nErosion of Merit-Based Employment\n\nThe core of the U.S. civil service system is its reliance on merit-based hiring and retention. By creating a new class of federal employees exempt from competitive hiring and procedural protections, Schedule F undermines this foundation. It risks turning experienced, apolitical experts into political appointees subject to loyalty tests and partisan whims. Numerous reports, including those from the Partnership for Public Service and the Government Accountability Office, have documented how politicization of the civil service leads to inefficiency, loss of institutional knowledge, and damage to public trust.\n\nImpacts on Government Functionality and Continuity\n\nSchedule F could destabilize federal agencies by making thousands of career positions vulnerable to sudden dismissal. This would deter qualified individuals from pursuing or remaining in public service, especially in critical policy areas like public health, national security, and environmental protection. These functions depend on continuity, expertise, and institutional memory\u2014not political alignment.\n\nLack of Transparency and Oversight\n\nThe proposed implementation of Schedule F lacks transparency and sufficient safeguards against abuse. There is no clear, objective standard for determining which roles qualify as \u201cpolicy-determining.\u201d As a result, political appointees could use Schedule F arbitrarily to purge career professionals who provide inconvenient facts or sound legal analysis, silencing dissent and eroding checks and balances.\n\nNational Security and Public Safety Concerns\n\nIn national security, law enforcement, and public health, policy must be informed by objective data and long-term expertise. Purging career professionals in these areas based on perceived political loyalty could have dire consequences for national preparedness and crisis response. Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss professionals who speak out against unlawful or dangerous policies, weakening the government's ability to protect the public.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, implementing Schedule F would damage the effectiveness, independence, and credibility of the federal workforce. It opens the door to patronage, diminishes the morale of public servants, and threatens the democratic principle of nonpartisan governance. I urge the relevant agencies and the administration to reject any proposal to implement Schedule F and instead protect and strengthen merit-based civil service protections.",

Numerous reports, including those from the Partnership for Public Service and the Government Accountability Office, have documented how politicization of the civil service leads to inefficiency, loss of institutional knowledge, and damage to public trust.\n\nImpacts on Government Functionality and Continuity\n\nSchedule F could destabilize federal agencies by making thousands of career positions vulnerable to sudden dismissal. This would deter qualified individuals from pursuing or remaining in public service, especially in critical policy areas like public health, national security, and environmental protection. These functions depend on continuity, expertise, and institutional memory\u2014not political alignment.\n\nLack of Transparency and Oversight\n\nThe proposed implementation of Schedule F lacks transparency and sufficient safeguards against abuse. There is no clear, objective standard for determining which roles qualify as \u201cpolicy-determining.\u201d As a result, political appointees could use Schedule F arbitrarily to purge career professionals who provide inconvenient facts or sound legal analysis, silencing dissent and eroding checks and balances.\n\nNational Security and Public Safety Concerns\n\nIn national security, law enforcement, and public health, policy must be informed by objective data and long-term expertise. Purging career professionals in these areas based on perceived political loyalty could have dire consequences for national preparedness and crisis response. Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss professionals who speak out against unlawful or dangerous policies, weakening the government's ability to protect the public.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, implementing Schedule F would damage the effectiveness, independence, and credibility of the federal workforce. It opens the door to patronage, diminishes the morale of public servants, and threatens the democratic principle of nonpartisan governance. I urge the relevant agencies and the administration to reject any proposal to implement Schedule F and instead protect and strengthen merit-based civil service protections.",

I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and run a neuroscience lab funded partly by funds from the NIH. \n\nI concur with the objectives of the proposed rule, namely the goal of holding employees accountable for poor performance and making it easier to remove such poorly-performing employees from their positions. The challenges imposed by chapter 75 and chapter 43 are identified as key limits on having appropriate accountability. However, the text as given identifies that federal employees involved in grant-making should be classified as political appointees rather than career civil servants. This shift seems to be proposed only as an expedient method of making more employees easily removable, but does not directly address the concerns with the protections written into chapters 75 and 43. If the problem is that chapters 75 and 43 specify protections that are too onerous to meet and which are actively harming governmental efficacy, then OPM should seek to change those chapters. Changing the categorization of different positions to make them more easily removable is a solution with unintended and undesirable side effects, specifically, it removes the independence of scientists to pursue truth, free from the policy objectives of the administration. One could easily imagine abuse of this change if, for instance, an administration were to come to power with the goal of preventing research on links between vaccines and autism, and were to appoint a person into a grantmaking position who could block all such research. This would significantly restrict the freedom of scientists to pursue such links if they desired to do so. ",

This raises profound legal, constitutional, and operational concerns.\n\n1. Due Process and Legal Precedent\nThe rule undermines procedural due process guarantees recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in Arnett v. Kennedy and its progeny. These protections were codified by Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to prevent arbitrary removals and ensure civil servants are not penalized for political or personal reasons. By eliminating appeal rights and adverse action procedures for employees with property interests in their jobs, the rule exposes the government to constitutional challenge.\n\n2. Contravention of Congressional Intent\nCongress has repeatedly affirmed the importance of a professional, merit-based civil service. By shifting employees into an at-will status without legislative input, the proposed rule improperly sidelines the statutory framework Congress enacted to protect career employees and maintain government neutrality.\n\n3. Erosion of Merit System Principles\nThe merit system exists to protect both employees and the public from politicization of the civil service. Removing adverse action protections for \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d employees risks creating a chilling effect on internal dissent and encourages self-censorship, undermining the very accountability the rule purports to enhance.\n\n4. Insufficient Justification for Reversal\nThe rule seeks to overturn the April 2024 final rule with minimal justification. The rationale offered\u2014largely consisting of political preference and unquantified surveys\u2014is insufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act. A mere change in presidential administration does not justify abandonment of established policy without substantial evidence.\n\n5. Unlawful Curtailment of Public Participation\nDespite the substantial nature of the rule, OPM has allowed only 30 days for public comment, contravening the 60-day minimum generally required under Executive Order 12866. The rule\u2019s complexity and implications necessitate a full and fair opportunity for public input.\n\nFor all of the above reasons, I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety. If not withdrawn, at a minimum, the comment period must be extended to 60 days to allow stakeholders to fully analyze and respond to the significant legal and policy issues raised.",

Unlawful Curtailment of Public Participation\nDespite the substantial nature of the rule, OPM has allowed only 30 days for public comment, contravening the 60-day minimum generally required under Executive Order 12866. The rule\u2019s complexity and implications necessitate a full and fair opportunity for public input.\n\nFor all of the above reasons, I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety. If not withdrawn, at a minimum, the comment period must be extended to 60 days to allow stakeholders to fully analyze and respond to the significant legal and policy issues raised.",

The policy \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" says that \"Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role may occupy policymaking positions.\"\n\nWhile policy should be informed by good science, science should not be driven by policy goals. The American people have funded science research for decades, which has led to a golden era of American progress. Having policymakers in grantmaking roles will hinder this progress by making grantmaking about enacting policy instead of about doing the best science in the world.

By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants-particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis-to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b) (8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies-undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law.

Schedule F undermines this foundation by permitting political appointees to reclassify career employees, potentially leading to mass dismissals based on ideology or perceived disloyalty rather than job performance. \n\nReintroducing Schedule F could result in the loss of thousands of experienced career officials who possess institutional knowledge critical to the functioning of government.

This approach echoes the 19th-century spoils system, which contributed to rampant corruption and inefficiency. Politicization compromises the integrity of public administration and blurs the distinction between neutral competence and partisan agenda, ultimately damaging public trust in government institutions.\n\nCivil servants are bound by codes of conduct and ethics that are designed to ensure impartial service to the public, not to political interests. Weakening their job protections through mechanisms like Schedule F increases pressure to conform to political demands, even when those demands conflict with established law or best practices.

    "comment": "My understanding is that part of the purpose of having career civil servants is so that our nation's technical and scientific expertise is disconnected from whoever is politically in charge, so that high-quality rule-making and implementation are provided regardless of party leadership. It seems like making more employees eligible to be fired \"at-will\" would make it easier for experts to be replaced by political players who will create rules which benefit those in power, rather than the American people. This would undoubtedly weaken our great country, which is great in part because of its resilient institutions. I strongly oppose this proposed rule because of the vulnerability to political exploitation that it would introduce to our system. ",

    "comment": "Section E's rationale is untenable due to its failure to meet baseline standards for information quality and regulatory analysis, lacking objective evidence to support its cost-benefit claims. Moreover, the proposal constitutes an executive overreach into Congress's core legislative function of structuring the federal civil service and defining statutory rights. These analytical and constitutional deficiencies compel the proposal's rejection.\n\n* Non-Compliance with Information Quality & Regulatory Analysis Standards: OPM\u2019s dismissal of established reliance interests rests on a deficient analytical foundation, failing standards mandated by the Information Quality Act (Pub. L. 106-554, \u00a7 515) and Executive Orders on regulatory review (e.g., E.O. 12866/13563). These standards require objectivity, utility, integrity, and analysis based on the best reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and other information. Section E offers conclusory statements that reliance interests are \"misplaced\" or \"outweighed\" by vaguely defined harms (\"poor performance,\" \"partisanship\") without presenting credible, objective data demonstrating the scope of these harms specifically within the target population or proving they are unaddressable through existing means. Crucially, it lacks a rigorous, evidence-based assessment of the substantial costs associated with removing procedural safeguards\u2014including loss of specialized expertise, diminished recruitment appeal for critical roles, institutional instability, and the erosion of objective analysis within agencies. This failure to conduct a balanced, data-driven cost-benefit analysis renders the justification inadequate under established requirements for reasoned agency decision-making.\n\n * Encroachment upon Congress's Legislative Power (Article I): The proposal fundamentally alters the employment status and rights of a significant segment of the federal workforce established under laws enacted by Congress. Article I grants Congress the power to structure the government, including establishing offices and regulating the conditions of federal employment, particularly for non-principal officers (Cf. Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926); Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935)). Through the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), Congress meticulously designed the current system, including specifying which career employees receive Chapter 75 procedural protections (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511).

    "original_comment": "Section E's rationale is untenable due to its failure to meet baseline standards for information quality and regulatory analysis, lacking objective evidence to support its cost-benefit claims. Moreover, the proposal constitutes an executive overreach into Congress's core legislative function of structuring the federal civil service and defining statutory rights. These analytical and constitutional deficiencies compel the proposal's rejection.\n\n* Non-Compliance with Information Quality & Regulatory Analysis Standards: OPM\u2019s dismissal of established reliance interests rests on a deficient analytical foundation, failing standards mandated by the Information Quality Act (Pub. L. 106-554, \u00a7 515) and Executive Orders on regulatory review (e.g., E.O. 12866/13563). These standards require objectivity, utility, integrity, and analysis based on the best reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and other information. Section E offers conclusory statements that reliance interests are \"misplaced\" or \"outweighed\" by vaguely defined harms (\"poor performance,\" \"partisanship\") without presenting credible, objective data demonstrating the scope of these harms specifically within the target population or proving they are unaddressable through existing means. Crucially, it lacks a rigorous, evidence-based assessment of the substantial costs associated with removing procedural safeguards\u2014including loss of specialized expertise, diminished recruitment appeal for critical roles, institutional instability, and the erosion of objective analysis within agencies. This failure to conduct a balanced, data-driven cost-benefit analysis renders the justification inadequate under established requirements for reasoned agency decision-making.\n\n * Encroachment upon Congress's Legislative Power (Article I): The proposal fundamentally alters the employment status and rights of a significant segment of the federal workforce established under laws enacted by Congress. Article I grants Congress the power to structure the government, including establishing offices and regulating the conditions of federal employment, particularly for non-principal officers (Cf. Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926); Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935)). Through the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), Congress meticulously designed the current system, including specifying which career employees receive Chapter 75 procedural protections (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511).

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \"Schedule F\" classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nIf passed, this regulation would return us to a spoils system, in violation of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. This act was passed to rid us of the corruption rampant in the executive branch of government during the Gilded Age and was a direct response to the assassination of President Garfield, who was shot by a disappointed donor promised an ambassadorship. The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act ensured that the hiring and promotion in the executive branch of the government is based on merit; it also ensures stability in our federal government as hirings are non-partisan and not based on loyalty or patronage to any specific politician. \n\nAdditionally, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violates the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of employees of their protections would have a chilling effect on dissent with the agencies, due to fear of reprisal.\n\nSchedule F will likely be interpreted very broadly, impacting employees whose position has no impact on policy just because one job in their career series may have policy influence. Filling the executive branch with only those loyal to the current government (vice the constitution) has proven to lead only to corruption and government waste, fraud, and abuse as in the post Civil War era United States of America.

    "comment": "I am against schedule F.\n\nThe proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule, which would reclassify certain federal employees into \"at-will\" positions exempt from competitive service protections, contravenes longstanding civil service laws, violates congressional intent, and risks judicial invalidation. Below is a substantive legal critique:\n\nStatutory Protections Under the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) and Title 5\nThe Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) (Pub. L. 95-454) established a merit-based system for federal employment, codified in Title 5 of the U.S. Code. Key provisions include:\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 \u2013 Mandates that federal personnel decisions be based on merit and free from political coercion.\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 \u2013 Grants the President authority to prescribe regulations for the competitive service but does not permit blanket removal of due process rights.\n\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 \u2013 Requires that career employees in the competitive service may only be removed for cause and after procedural protections (notice, right to respond, appeal rights).\n\nLegal Conflict: Schedule F attempts to circumvent these statutory due process protections by reclassifying employees into an excepted service category (5 C.F.R. Part 212), effectively stripping them of \u00a7 7513 rights without congressional authorization.\n\n2. Violation of Congressional Intent\nCongress has repeatedly reinforced civil service protections, including:\n\nThe Pendleton Act (1883) \u2013 Ended the spoils system by requiring merit-based hiring.\n\nThe Lloyd-La Follette Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7211) \u2013 Protects federal employees\u2019 rights to petition Congress and speak out without retaliation.\n\nThe Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8)) \u2013 Shields employees who disclose wrongdoing.\n\nJudicial Precedent: Courts have ruled that the executive branch cannot unilaterally override statutory employment protections. In NTEU v. Reagan (1985), the courts upheld that the President\u2019s removal authority is constrained by civil service laws. Similarly, in Elgin v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury* (2012), the Supreme Court affirmed that federal employees have statutory appeal rights under the CSRA.\n\n3. Separation of Powers Concerns\nThe Constitution vests Congress with authority over federal employment (Article I, \u00a7 8; Article II, \u00a7 2). While the President has removal power (Myers v. U.S., 1926), it is not absolute. In Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. U.S. (1935), the Court ruled that Congress can impose restrictions on the removal of certain officials to ensure independence.\n\nLegal Risk: Schedule F\u2019s broad reclassification of policy-related roles likely exceeds OPM\u2019s regulatory authority under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3302, which requires that exceptions to competitive service rules be \"necessary\" and \"conditions of good administration.\" Courts may strike it down as arbitrary and capricious under Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm (1983).\n\n4. Due Process and First Amendment Implications\n\nFifth Amendment Due Process: Federal employees with a property interest in their jobs (Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 1985) cannot be deprived of employment without due process. Schedule F eliminates these protections without justification.\n\nFirst Amendment Retaliation: If employees are fired for political reasons, this could violate Branti v. Finkel (1980), which bars patronage dismissals unless party affiliation is a legitimate job requirement.\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) Violations\nOPM\u2019s rulemaking must comply with the APA (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551-559). If Schedule F is implemented without sufficient justification or public input, it could be challenged as:\n\nArbitrary and capricious (State Farm, 1983);\n\nIn excess of statutory authority (Chevron U.S.A. v. NRDC, 1984).\n\nConclusion: Schedule F Is Legally Unsound\nThe proposed rule disregards Title 5 protections, congressional intent, and judicial precedent safeguarding merit-based civil service. If implemented, it invites litigation under the CSRA, APA, and Constitutional doctrines, with a high likelihood of being struck down. Instead of dismantling due process rights, OPM should focus on strengthening workforce accountability within existing framework",

Reclassifying a broad segment of career civil servants\u2014especially those involved in policy-making and analysis\u2014would allow for termination without cause, effectively turning these roles into political appointments.

Society expects civil servants to carryout their jobs in a professional manner & follow the law. If the executive branch doesn't like the law(s) being executed by the civil service than she/he should work with Congress to change the law(s) that dictate the department\u2019s mandates. \n\nThe proposed change could likely have far reaching impacts on departments like the Environmental Protection Service (EPA) which has Congressionally approved mandates for preserving clean air and water.

    "comment": "Based on my experience with both government employment and supervision of government employees, I believe that rules for career civil service can at times restrict the ability to remove poor performers. However, removing adverse action proceedings and appeal rights would only increase the likelihood of workplace harassment, intimidation, retaliation, and other forms of misconduct. Allowing supervisors to remove employees without documenting misconduct or poor performance would reduce accountability instead of increasing it. The rule as currently written delinks performance from decision-making about whether an employee should continue to work at an agency--which is the opposite of the stated intent of this rule. What would help is to reduce the number of requirements for \"performance improvement plans\" and so forth while still rigidly enforcing the requirement that firing must be for cause. \n\nIf an employee is not performing to standards, it should not take 2-3 years of poor performance evaluations to get rid of them. The government doesn't owe employees continued paychecks if they can't do the work properly, nor does it need to allow people to make lateral moves or even \"fail up\". What I would encourage the administration is to fix that specific issue: focus the process on whether an employee is fulfilling their duties and abiding by the relevant laws and standards of conduct. Allowing supervisors to remove poor performers is likely to produce a more efficient and effective workforce; allowing supervisors to remove anyone for any reason is likely to produce a sycophantic and potentially even corrupt workforce. If you care about performance and accountability, you should strongly consider hewing to the spirit of the merit-based system.\n\nAs long as there are any rules about which reasons are permissible to fire a person--and even under this rule there are certain distinctions such as not being able to fire a person based on their support for a president but still being able to fire a person based on their willingness to enact administration policies--there needs to be a transparent and accountable process that verifies whether the rules were adhered to. The less oversight and enforcement you have of policies to ensure decisions are based on performance, the more likely it is that bad actors will abuse the power conferred upon them to the detriment of the government and the American people at large.",

Chapters 43 and 75.\nThis proposal is not only contrary to the principles of the merit-based civil service system, but also legally deficient and constitutionally suspect.\n1. Violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 \u2013 Merit System Principles\nFederal employees serve under a system grounded in the merit principles codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301, which require fair and open competition, protections against arbitrary action, and retention based on performance. Stripping civil servants of Chapter 43 and Chapter 75 rights contradicts \u00a7 2301(b)(2) and (b)(8), which ensure protection against arbitrary removal and prohibit actions based on political coercion or partisan influence.\nAlthough the proposed rule purports to maintain nonpartisan hiring, the removal of due process protections converts these roles into de facto political appointments\u2014an outcome that undermines the \u201cnonpartisan, merit-based\u201d civil service OPM claims to preserve.\n2. Inconsistency with Oath of Office and Constitutional Mandates\nFederal employees swear an oath under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3331 to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d This includes duties that may conflict with Presidential directives that are unconstitutional or unlawful. Penalizing employees for \u201cundermining Presidential directives\u201d (as referenced in the rule) invites abuse and contravenes the oath-bound responsibility to uphold the Constitution\u2014not any single President\u2019s agenda.\nThe Supreme Court has long held that public employees do not forfeit their constitutional protections. See Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563 (1968). More recently, the Court reaffirmed that \u201cthe government may not condition public employment on a basis that infringes the employee\u2019s constitutionally protected interest in freedom of expression.\u201d Lane v. Franks, 573 U.S. 228, 236 (2014).\n3. Due Process Violations \u2013 Deprivation Without Notice or Hearing\nThe proposed reclassification into \u201cat-will\u201d status deprives affected employees of their current property interest in continued federal employment without due process of law, violating the Fifth Amendment. See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985) (holding that public employees with a property interest in their employment are entitled to notice and a hearing before termination).\n4. Arbitrary and Capricious Under APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\nThe proposed rule fails to demonstrate a reasoned analysis or empirical justification for overturning the comprehensive reforms adopted in OPM\u2019s April 2024 final rule. Agencies already have authority under Chapters 43 and 75 to discipline and remove poor performers. The assertion that these tools are ineffective is speculative and unsupported by data. Agencies\u2019 frustration with procedural requirements does not justify removing foundational due process protections for civil servants.\nMoreover, the rule\u2019s vague terminology\u2014particularly \u201cundermining the democratic process by subverting Presidential directives\u201d\u2014is both overbroad and chilling. It lacks the clarity and precision required of regulations that affect constitutional rights, see Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108\u201309 (1972).\n5. Recommendations and Rewording\nRather than repealing Chapter 43 and 75 protections, OPM should consider administrative reforms that expedite current procedures without eliminating them entirely. The following revisions would preserve due process while addressing performance challenges:\n\u2022\tRetain the April 2024 definitions limiting \u201cpolicy-influencing positions\u201d to political appointments.\n\u2022\tMaintain Chapter 43 and 75 protections, but allow for streamlined timelines and mediation tools.\n\u2022\tDefine misconduct in objective, job-related terms rather than vague references to political disloyalty.\nConclusion\nThe proposed rule threatens the constitutional order, undermines the merit system, and reintroduces political patronage into the career civil service. I urge OPM to withdraw this proposal in its entirety or substantially revise it to preserve statutory and constitutional safeguards.\n",

    "comment": "I oppose this proposed rule.\n\nCivil service protections exist for a reason: to allow career experts to provide sound advice to their respective agencies and the administration, without the disruptions that would arise when leadership changes every four or eight years.  Political appointees are able to be dismissed at will, but extending this to include anyone working in a \"confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\" would prevent those employees from providing reliable, unbiased policy opinions, without fear of retribution.  Removal of typical civil service protections will degrade the quality of applicants willing to fill those positions, and open opportunities for using government positions as a reward for political loyalty.  The extent of positions that would be considered \"policy-influencing\" is unclear, as is who is able to make the determination whether a position falls into that category, providing potential avenues for abuse.\n\nThe supplemental information states: \"Surveys show few agency supervisors believe they could dismiss subordinates for serious misconduct or unacceptable performance.\"  It goes on to state that this undermines the merit system.  However, surveys on supervisor beliefs do not constitute data or evidence of actual harm.  It is wholly unclear whether the problem this proposed rule seeks to tackle even exists, and there is no evidence that, despite supervisor beliefs, individuals could not be removed for serious misconduct or poor performance.  Instead, what is presented herein is that there are no attempts made to remove poor performers; an issue that could be tackled through direction and improved management, not reclassification of employees.  The provided information goes on to state: \"Executive Order 13957 recognized the value of a nonpartisan merit service that develops and maintains institutional knowledge and experience,\" however the proposed rule does nothing to protect nonpartisan merit service or maintain institutional knowledge, instead directly threatening both of these by attempting to categorize potentially large swathes of government employees as at-will.  The proposed rule points to the lack of appeal to adverse actions until the 1960s as the desired baseline to return to.  This \"historic baseline\" has no reflection on the present day for two reasons: firstly, because the introduction of those appeal rights speak to a recognized need for those rights to exist (much like they say \"all safety rules are written in blood\"), and secondly, because this supposed baseline is from sixty years ago, a time before the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Education, Veteran's Affairs, or Homeland Security even existed.  Should we return to a 1960s baseline of water quality, before the Environmental Protection Agency existed?  The 1960s baseline of nuclear safety, before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?  These protections have existed for the entirety of these organizations, and stripping these protections would be upending decades of baseline to usher in an era of instability.\n\nFurther, it is extremely difficult to accept that the Office of Personnel Management is operating in good faith considering their flagrant flouting of civil servant protections for federal employees already carried out under this administration.  Within the context of the ongoing illegal firings and associated court cases, reductions-in-force that seem to deviate from proper procedure, and comments from political appointees seeking to \"give federal employees trauma\", this proposed rule can only be interpreted as another avenue to purge dedicated civil servants that, in the course of faithfully performing their duties, may impede the execution of illegal, fraudulent, or abusive actions of political appointees.\n\nThis proposed rule would degrade performance, accountability, and responsiveness in the civil service, not improve it.",

    "comment": "Schedule F is unacceptable for the American public because it undermines the core principles of fairness, accountability, and transparency in government, which are essential for maintaining public trust and effective governance. The foundation of a democratic system is that the government serves the interests of all its citizens\u2014not the interests of the ruling party or individuals in power. Schedule F threatens to fundamentally alter that balance by allowing politically motivated appointments to replace career civil servants, thus eroding the impartiality and professionalism that the public relies on.\n\nFirst, Schedule F puts political loyalty ahead of competence. The American people expect their government to be run by qualified, knowledgeable professionals, not individuals selected based on their loyalty to the president or political party. By removing the protections that safeguard career civil servants, Schedule F opens the door to cronyism and favoritism, replacing skilled professionals with individuals whose primary qualification may simply be their political allegiance. This undermines the ability of government agencies to carry out their duties with integrity and effectiveness, which directly impacts the quality of services the public receives.\n\nSecond, Schedule F creates a government that is more susceptible to corruption. When positions of power are awarded based on political loyalty rather than expertise, the door is opened for decisions to be made based on personal or partisan interests rather than the needs of the American people. This weakens public confidence in the government, as people are less likely to trust a system that prioritizes political connections over the rule of law and public interest.\n\nMoreover, this shift toward politicizing the federal workforce disrupts the stability and continuity of government operations. The public relies on consistent, reliable governance, especially in critical areas like national security, public health, and economic policy. Schedule F risks creating a revolving door of political appointees, with each administration bringing its own loyalists, leading to inefficiency, inconsistency, and delays in important services and decisions. This instability undermines the government\u2019s ability to effectively address the needs of the public, particularly in times of crisis or when long-term planning is required.\n\nIn essence, Schedule F undermines the very principles of a fair and democratic government by politicizing the civil service, eroding the rule of law, and diminishing public trust. For the American public to have faith in their government, they must be assured that public servants are working in their best interests, not driven by partisan motives.

    "comment": "I firmly oppose the introduction or reinstatement of the 'Schedule F' classification for federal employees. This proposal endangers the merit-based civil service system that has supported a professional, impartial federal workforce for over a century.\n\nThe creation of Schedule F fundamentally undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was designed to eliminate the spoils system and establish merit-based hiring. Reclassifying career civil servants\u2014especially those in policy-making or analytical roles\u2014without cause invites politically motivated hiring and firing. This directly contradicts the principle of an apolitical civil service, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions remain merit-driven and free from political interference.\n\nAdditionally, the vague and expansive criteria for Schedule F inclusion violate the due process protections enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires just cause and procedural safeguards for removing career employees. Denying these protections weakens accountability and discourages honest, expert advice, ultimately jeopardizing the effectiveness of government operations.\n\nMoreover, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is mandated by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to uphold merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F not only contradicts this statutory mission but also subjects career professionals to undue political pressure, threatening the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn summary, Schedule F poses a severe threat to good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any efforts to implement or revive this perilous classification.",

    "comment": "Schedule F threatens election security by politicizing the federal workforce, particularly in agencies responsible for overseeing and safeguarding the electoral process. By reclassifying tens of thousands of civil servants as \u201cat-will\u201d employees, the policy allows for the removal of experienced professionals who manage critical aspects of election administration, such as voter registration, ballot security, and election monitoring. This creates a system where positions can be filled based on political loyalty rather than expertise, undermining the impartiality essential to free and fair elections.\n\nThe politicization of these roles increases the risk of partisan interference in the electoral process. When individuals are appointed based on political allegiance rather than merit, decisions regarding election procedures and safeguards may be influenced by partisan interests, potentially compromising the integrity of elections. Such actions could lead to the manipulation of voting systems, suppression of voter turnout, or the undermining of election results, all of which threaten the foundational principles of democracy.\n\nFurthermore, the erosion of civil service protections under Schedule F may deter qualified professionals from entering or remaining in public service. The uncertainty and politicization associated with these positions can discourage individuals committed to upholding democratic values from working in election-related roles, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge and expertise. This degradation of the federal workforce not only weakens the capacity to administer elections effectively but also diminishes public confidence in the electoral system.\n\nIn summary, Schedule F poses a significant threat to election security by introducing political considerations into the administration of elections, increasing the potential for partisan interference, and undermining the professionalism and integrity of the federal workforce.

Schedule F could exacerbate these challenges by limiting job opportunities in the public sector, which many military spouses rely on for stable, fulfilling employment.

    "comment": "Schedule F is inherently detrimental because it fundamentally undermines the values of fairness, trust, and integrity in government. These values are not just matters of policy\u2014they are core principles that define the relationship between the government and the public. When people lose faith in the government\u2019s ability to function impartially and in the best interests of the people, it erodes the very foundation of democracy.\n\nThe American public relies on the belief that the government is there to serve everyone, not just those in power or those with political connections. A government that hires and fires based on political loyalty, rather than merit and expertise, sends a message that the public service is a tool for partisan gain rather than an impartial institution working for the common good. This is not just an issue of efficiency or economics\u2014it strikes at the heart of what it means to live in a democracy. If the civil service becomes politically motivated, it no longer serves as a neutral body that implements the will of the people, regardless of political affiliation. Instead, it becomes a tool of the ruling party.\n\nThe trust of the American people in their government is fragile and, once lost, is incredibly difficult to rebuild. The public deserves to know that when policies are enacted, they are based on expertise, fairness, and long-term strategy, not on political loyalty or personal gain. When that trust is compromised, the very legitimacy of the government is at risk. Schedule F doesn\u2019t just undermine government efficiency or waste money\u2014it directly threatens the social contract between the government and the governed, and that is an argument that cannot be countered with facts or figures. The loss of trust, once it occurs, is irreversible, and the consequences of eroding public confidence in the impartiality of government are far-reaching and profound.",

When people lose faith in the government\u2019s ability to function impartially and in the best interests of the people, it erodes the very foundation of democracy.\n\nThe American public relies on the belief that the government is there to serve everyone, not just those in power or those with political connections. A government that hires and fires based on political loyalty, rather than merit and expertise, sends a message that the public service is a tool for partisan gain rather than an impartial institution working for the common good. This is not just an issue of efficiency or economics\u2014it strikes at the heart of what it means to live in a democracy. If the civil service becomes politically motivated, it no longer serves as a neutral body that implements the will of the people, regardless of political affiliation. Instead, it becomes a tool of the ruling party.\n\nThe trust of the American people in their government is fragile and, once lost, is incredibly difficult to rebuild. The public deserves to know that when policies are enacted, they are based on expertise, fairness, and long-term strategy, not on political loyalty or personal gain. When that trust is compromised, the very legitimacy of the government is at risk. Schedule F doesn\u2019t just undermine government efficiency or waste money\u2014it directly threatens the social contract between the government and the governed, and that is an argument that cannot be countered with facts or figures. The loss of trust, once it occurs, is irreversible, and the consequences of eroding public confidence in the impartiality of government are far-reaching and profound.",

When these positions are filled by individuals with little to no experience or institutional memory, government programs are more likely to face delays, mismanagement, and unnecessary costs. Instead of leveraging the knowledge and experience of long-standing professionals to ensure efficient and effective outcomes, the government would be forced to reinvent the wheel with each change in personnel.\n\nAnother hidden cost of Schedule F is the potential for a more politically driven and fragmented bureaucracy. When government functions are influenced by political appointments, agencies may prioritize partisan goals over effective policy implementation, leading to poor allocation of resources. Taxpayer dollars could be wasted on inefficient projects, redundant services, or initiatives driven by short-term political agendas rather than long-term value for the public.\n\nFinally, the decreased morale and uncertainty within the civil service under Schedule F would lead to lower productivity and increased absenteeism. As government employees worry about job security and the potential for politically motivated firings, their ability to focus on their duties diminishes, leading to lower output and reduced quality of service.\n\nIn essence, Schedule F wastes taxpayer money by creating inefficiencies, increasing turnover, reducing the quality of government programs, and encouraging politically motivated decisions that serve partisan interests rather than the public good.

    "comment": "Schedule F undermines the legal principles enshrined in U.S. civil service law, particularly those that ensure the government operates impartially, efficiently, and free from political influence. The core of the U.S. civil service system is built on the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which established a merit-based system for hiring and retaining federal employees to protect them from political pressures. The law was designed to prevent cronyism and patronage systems that undermine public trust in government by ensuring that federal positions are filled based on qualifications, not political allegiance. Schedule F directly conflicts with these foundational legal protections by allowing political appointees to replace career civil servants without the safeguards of merit-based hiring.\n\n1. The Pendleton Act of 1883\nThe Pendleton Act, codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 et seq., established the U.S. civil service system, creating a competitive, merit-based hiring process for federal employees. This was a direct response to the patronage system that had dominated federal appointments before, which was ripe for corruption and inefficiency. By undermining this merit-based system, Schedule F reverses nearly 140 years of progress in establishing a professional, non-partisan civil service that serves the public rather than political interests. Reclassifying employees as \u201cat-will\u201d removes the safeguards established by the Pendleton Act and permits political interference in areas where impartiality and expertise are essential.\n\n2. The Hatch Act of 1939 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7321-7326)\nThe Hatch Act restricts the political activities of federal employees to ensure that government operations are conducted without partisan influence. By facilitating the hiring of political appointees to replace career civil servants, Schedule F creates the risk of partisan decision-making and the politicization of federal services that the Hatch Act sought to prevent. While the Hatch Act does not apply to political appointees, it is important to note that the integrity of government agencies depends on the impartiality of all positions, including those not directly related to political campaigns. Schedule F, by allowing politically loyal appointees to replace career professionals, erodes the separation between government administration and partisan politics.\n\n3. The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 et seq.)\nThe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) governs the processes by which federal agencies create regulations and make decisions that affect the public. It emphasizes transparency, accountability, and fairness in agency operations. By increasing political control over the civil service, Schedule F undermines these principles, as decisions within federal agencies may be influenced by political motives rather than the impartial application of law and policy. Agencies could make decisions based on political loyalty rather than the best interests of the public or the law, violating the APA\u2019s core tenets.\n\n4. The Merit Systems Protection Board (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 et seq.)\nThe Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) serves as an independent agency tasked with protecting federal employees from unfair treatment and upholding the integrity of the merit system. Under Schedule F, employees who are reclassified as political appointees would no longer be able to appeal unjust dismissals to the MSPB, effectively eliminating their ability to seek redress for political retribution or discriminatory actions. This deprives federal employees of their right to challenge unfair treatment and undermines the system of checks and balances that ensures fairness in government employment.\n\n5. Legal Precedent on the Civil Service System\nIn Garcia v. United States, 469 U.S. 70 (1984), the Supreme Court held that federal employees are entitled to due process protections, including the right to appeal wrongful terminations, under the civil service laws. By weakening the protections against arbitrary dismissal, Schedule F undermines this legal precedent, as it would allow political loyalty to override due process, leading to arbitrary firings and greater vulnerability to political manipulation.\n\nIn conclusion, Schedule F undermines the legal foundation of the U.S. civil service system by circumventing the protections against political patronage established by the Pendleton Act, eroding the impartiality sought by the Hatch Act, and disregarding the procedural safeguards of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Merit Systems Protection Board. These legal protections are essential to maintaining a government that is efficient, accountable, and responsive to the needs of the people\u2014without undue influence from partisan politics. By dismantling these protections, Schedule F introduces the potential for legal violations and undermines the core principles of fairness and transparency that are fundamental to effective governance.",

    "comment": "Schedule F poses a serious threat to public trust in the government by fundamentally altering the way federal employees are hired, retained, and dismissed. The core of the U.S. civil service system, established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, is built on the principle that government employees should be selected based on merit rather than political loyalty. This system ensures that positions are filled by qualified individuals who are dedicated to serving the public impartially, regardless of political affiliation. By reclassifying tens of thousands of career civil servants as \u201cat-will\u201d employees subject to dismissal for political reasons, Schedule F undermines these safeguards and opens the door for cronyism, where jobs are awarded based on political allegiance rather than expertise.\n\nWhen positions within federal agencies are filled based on political loyalty, rather than merit, the public begins to question whether decisions are made with the best interests of all citizens in mind, or whether they are influenced by partisan motives. The introduction of political influence into essential government functions erodes the trust the public places in these institutions, leading citizens to believe that policies may be shaped not by the need to serve the public, but by the desire to reward political supporters. This perception of favoritism breeds cynicism and undermines the democratic principle that government decisions should be made for the good of society, not for political gain.\n\nFurthermore, Schedule F destabilizes the federal workforce by making it easier for political appointees to dismiss career professionals. Such political turnover disrupts the continuity and stability that citizens expect from government agencies. Federal agencies are responsible for a wide range of services\u2014from public health and safety regulations to social services\u2014and these services require long-term planning and expertise. When agencies experience constant turnover, this can lead to delays, inefficiencies, and poor decision-making. For example, an administration may prioritize political loyalty over competence, resulting in unqualified individuals occupying critical roles, which reduces the quality of government services and further erodes public trust.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of protections against arbitrary dismissal removes accountability from government operations. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) was created to ensure that federal employees have recourse if they are unfairly targeted or dismissed. Schedule F circumvents this safeguard, allowing political interference to remove individuals without cause, simply because their views do not align with the current administration. This undermines the transparency that is vital for maintaining public confidence. When citizens feel that decisions are being made in secrecy, or that employees can be fired for political reasons, they become less likely to trust that the government is acting in their best interests.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Schedule F diminishes the democratic principle of equal treatment under the law. The federal government\u2019s ability to serve its citizens depends on the belief that it acts impartially, without favoritism or bias. By introducing political loyalty into hiring and firing decisions, Schedule F threatens the fairness of government services, leading people to wonder if they are receiving government benefits, protections, or services based on merit or political affiliation. This undermines the legitimacy of the government in the eyes of the people it serves, weakening the social contract between the government and its citizens.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these changes is a dramatic erosion of public trust. When citizens perceive that their government is driven by political patronage rather than professionalism, fairness, and competence, they lose faith in its ability to serve their needs. This disengagement from the democratic process can have long-lasting consequences, reducing civic participation and weakening the foundations of democracy itself. Trust in government is essential for a functioning democracy, and Schedule F undermines this trust by making the government appear more interested in rewarding political supporters than in serving the public impartially.",
    "original_comment": "Schedule F poses a serious threat to public trust in the government by fundamentally altering the way federal employees are hired, retained, and dismissed. The core of the U.S. civil service system, established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, is built on the principle that government employees should be selected based on merit rather than political loyalty. This system ensures that positions are filled by qualified individuals who are dedicated to serving the public impartially, regardless of political affiliation. By reclassifying tens of thousands of career civil servants as \u201cat-will\u201d employees subject to dismissal for political reasons, Schedule F undermines these safeguards and opens the door for cronyism, where jobs are awarded based on political allegiance rather than expertise.\n\nWhen positions within federal agencies are filled based on political loyalty, rather than merit, the public begins to question whether decisions are made with the best interests of all citizens in mind, or whether they are influenced by partisan motives.

    "comment": "Schedule F poses a significant threat to military readiness by introducing instability, inefficiency, and political interference into critical aspects of defense operations. Military readiness depends on a highly skilled, experienced, and stable workforce that can efficiently manage everything from defense procurement and logistics to policy development and strategic planning. Federal employees in key positions supporting the Department of Defense (DoD) play a crucial role in ensuring that these operations run smoothly. However, by reclassifying these positions and allowing political appointees to replace career civil servants, Schedule F jeopardizes the expertise and continuity necessary for effective defense management.\n\nOne of the most critical areas affected by Schedule F is defense procurement. The timely and effective procurement of materials, equipment, and technology is fundamental to maintaining military readiness. Civil servants in charge of procurement have deep knowledge of military requirements and the complexities of the defense contracting process, honed over years of experience. Replacing them with politically motivated appointees could lead to decisions driven more by political loyalty than military needs, resulting in delays, increased costs, and the potential acquisition of subpar materials. This can severely disrupt the military\u2019s operational capabilities, leaving it ill-equipped to respond to evolving threats.\n\nBeyond procurement, Schedule F also undermines the development of sound defense policies and strategies. Civil servants responsible for advising on military policy play a vital role in shaping national defense strategies, ensuring that they are based on expert knowledge and strategic foresight rather than political considerations. When political appointees replace these experts, decisions about national security may become more focused on political agendas than on the actual security needs of the nation. This shift could weaken the military\u2019s ability to respond effectively to emerging threats and compromise the quality of military planning, making it harder for the military to maintain readiness in a rapidly changing global environment.\n\nFurthermore, the turnover caused by Schedule F could destabilize the federal workforce, disrupting the continuity of operations within the DoD and other supporting agencies. Military readiness requires consistency and long-term planning, and frequent changes in leadership can cause confusion, delays, and inefficiencies. For instance, without experienced professionals in critical positions, it may take longer to implement policies or respond to operational needs, ultimately affecting the military\u2019s ability to stay prepared. The replacement of skilled civil servants with politically motivated appointees could also lower morale within the workforce, as employees may feel that competence and experience are no longer valued. This could erode the trust between military service members, contractors, and the federal agencies that support them, further diminishing the effectiveness of military operations.\n\nFinally, Schedule F\u2019s politicization of the federal workforce may introduce more bureaucracy and delays into the system. Politically appointed officials who lack the necessary technical expertise or institutional knowledge may create bottlenecks in decision-making processes, slowing down critical operations. The military relies on swift, decisive action in many situations, and any hindrance to the smooth functioning of defense logistics, policy development, or strategic execution could compromise national security.\n\nIn summary, Schedule F threatens military readiness by disrupting the continuity and effectiveness of the federal workforce that supports defense operations. The introduction of political interference into critical positions within the DoD could result in poor decision-making, delays in procurement, weakened defense policies, and a demoralized workforce\u2014all of which ultimately harm the military\u2019s ability to respond to emerging threats and maintain the operational effectiveness needed to protect the nation.",

To proceed otherwise would risk a reduction in the quality of US research -- including biomedical research touching upon the diseases that concern many Americans, like Alzheimer's and cancer -- due to the appointment of individuals who are insufficiently qualified, and/or approach science as a means to advancing their political goals, as opposed an objective pursuit of evidence-based knowledge.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the proposed expansion of Schedule Policy/Career as it directly contradicts the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA). The CSRA established merit system principles to ensure federal employees \"should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management without regard to political affiliation\" and be \"protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes\" (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)). While the CSRA does exempt positions \"of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character\" from certain protections (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(b)(2)), longstanding practice and multiple legal precedents have established that this exemption applies only to political appointees, not career civil servants with substantive responsibilities.\n\nThe expansion of Schedule Policy/Career would unlawfully strip tenure protections from thousands of career civil servants by misinterpreting the scope of this exemption. As held in Roth v. Brownell, 215 F.2d 500, 502 (D.C. Cir. 1954), \"Neither the formula of 'excepting' the kind of position a person holds, nor any other formula, can obviate the requirements\" of civil service protections. The Merit Systems Protection Board has consistently affirmed that a civil servant does not lose tenure protections merely because their position is reclassified, holding that such a determination \"is not adequate\" to strip CSRA rights \"unless it is made before the employee is appointed to the position\" (Thompson v. Dep't of Justice, 61 M.S.P.R. 364, 368-69 (1994)).\n\nThe expansion of Schedule Policy/Career would also create a cascading negative effect on non-management federal employees by undermining the stability and independence of their supervisors. When mid-level career managers and subject matter experts are reclassified as fireable at-will, they become vulnerable to political pressure to follow partisan directives rather than laws, regulations, and merit principles. This creates a hostile work environment where non-management employees may be asked to disregard established procedures, professional standards, or ethical guidelines to satisfy political objectives.",

    "comment": "I hereby express my firm opposition to the proposed implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This initiative not only jeopardizes the integrity of the merit-based civil service system that has sustained a professional and nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century but also raises significant legal and constitutional concerns.\n\nAt the outset, the establishment of Schedule F represents a direct challenge to the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. This foundational legislation was enacted to dismantle the spoils system and to institute a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By permitting an expansive range of career civil servants\u2014particularly those engaged in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without just cause, Schedule F effectively invites politically motivated employment practices. Such a framework is fundamentally incompatible with the principle of an apolitical civil service as mandated by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which stipulates that employment decisions within the federal sector must be based on merit and devoid of political influence.\n\nFurthermore, the ambiguous and overly broad criteria for inclusion in Schedule F raise profound concerns regarding due process as articulated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. This statute guarantees that career federal employees cannot be removed without just cause and ensures the provision of necessary procedural safeguards. The stripping away of these protections not only undermines accountability but also jeopardizes the provision of expert advice and dissent within federal agencies. The fear of arbitrary dismissal can result in a chilling effect on free speech and open dialogue, which are essential for effective governance.\n\nIt is also vital to consider the broader implications of Schedule F on organizational culture within federal agencies. The introduction of such a classification risks fostering an environment of fear and conformity, where employees may hesitate to propose innovative solutions or challenge existing policies due to the specter of political retribution. This detrimental atmosphere can severely hinder the ability of federal agencies to adapt to evolving challenges and to develop policies that are in the best interest of the public.\n\nMoreover, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to uphold the principles of the merit system. The implementation of Schedule F would not only contravene this statutory obligation but would also subject career professionals to undue political pressures, thereby compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across different administrations. The preservation of a nonpartisan civil service is essential for maintaining public trust and ensuring the equitable implementation of policies.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a substantial threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service autonomy, and the rule of law. I respectfully urge the administration and OPM to categorically reject any regulatory attempts to implement or revive this perilous classification. The integrity of our civil service\u2014and, by extension, the functioning of our democracy\u2014necessitates the protection of our public workforce from politically motivated actions.",

By reclassifying positions into Schedule P/C, the proposed rule would strip affected employees of critical protections against arbitrary dismissal, effectively making them at-will employees. This undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was enacted to prevent politicization and ensure a competent and impartial federal workforce.\n\nIncreased Risk of Politicization\n\nThe reintroduction of Schedule P/C opens the door to replacing experienced, nonpartisan professionals with individuals selected for their political loyalty rather than expertise. Such a shift could compromise the objectivity of policy analysis and implementation, leading to decisions that serve partisan interests over the public good. The National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE) has rightly noted that this move \"opens the door to replacing nonpartisan, professional civil servants with political loyalists\".\n\nUndermining Institutional Knowledge and Continuity\n\nFederal agencies rely on the institutional knowledge and continuity provided by career civil servants. Reclassifying positions and removing job protections could lead to a loss of experienced personnel, disrupting agency operations and diminishing the government's ability to effectively serve the public. The potential for mass dismissals based on political considerations threatens the stability and effectiveness of federal programs.\n\nLegal and Ethical Concerns\n\nThe proposed rule raises serious legal and ethical questions. The previous iteration, Schedule F, faced legal challenges and was ultimately rescinded due to concerns about its legality and potential for abuse. Reintroducing a similar framework disregards these concerns and may once again lead to protracted legal battles, diverting resources and attention from the government's primary responsibilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed reclassification of federal positions into Schedule Policy/Career represents a significant departure from the principles that have long safeguarded the integrity and effectiveness of the federal workforce. It threatens to politicize the civil service, erode merit-based protections, and disrupt the continuity of government operations. I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule and instead focus on strengthening the existing merit-based system that ensures a competent, impartial, and stable federal workforce.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose bringing back or moving forward with the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has supported a skilled, nonpartisan federal workforce for more than a century.\n\nAt its core, Schedule F goes against the purpose of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was created to end the old patronage system and make sure federal jobs were awarded based on merit\u2014not political connections. Schedule F would allow many career employees, especially those involved in shaping or analyzing policy, to be reclassified and even fired without cause. That opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing in roles that are meant to be impartial, directly violating the merit principles laid out in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8).\n\nOn top of that, the vague and broad guidelines for who qualifies for Schedule F ignore the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. These protections require fair procedures and valid reasons before a career employee can be removed. Taking those away would reduce transparency and accountability, discourage honest expert opinions, and weaken how well government agencies function.\n\nThis proposal also clashes with the mission of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which is legally required under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to protect the integrity of the merit system. Imposing Schedule F would force career employees into politically vulnerable positions and disrupt the professionalism and consistency that federal programs need to succeed across different administrations.\n\nEven more concerning is the way Schedule F would be rolled out\u2014it would let executive officials decide who qualifies without input from agencies or experts like administrative judges. That\u2019s a major overreach of authority and ignores the checks and balances that are supposed to guide these kinds of decisions. It also sidelines institutional expertise and undermines the legitimacy of the whole process.\n\nLastly, this sets a dangerous precedent. It directly violates Executive Order 14173, signed on January 21, 2025, which requires that all federal jobs be based on merit. Bringing back Schedule F would send the wrong message: that political convenience can outweigh the rule of law and the values of a professional, independent civil service.\n\nSchedule F runs counter to fair governance, due process, and the law.

    "comment": "I respectfully submits this comment in strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) proposed rule, \u201cImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.\u201d The proposal should be withdrawn in its entirety, as it is contrary to law, undermines fundamental merit system principles, threatens the integrity and independence of the career civil service, and disregards both empirical evidence and the carefully constructed framework OPM itself established in its April 2024 final rule titled \u201cUpholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles\u201d (89 FR 24982).\n\n1. The Proposal Conflicts with OPM\u2019s Own Recent Final Rule and Congressional Intent\nJust one year ago, OPM issued a final rule affirming that involuntary movements of career employees into the excepted service do not extinguish their statutory due process protections. The 2024 rule was grounded in decades of statutory authority and legal precedent, including the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and the Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912. In that rule, OPM clearly articulated that civil servants who meet the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511 retain procedural and appeal rights even if reassigned to a different schedule within the excepted service.\n\nBy contrast, the 2025 proposed rule attempts to rescind the 2024 reforms and eliminate MSPB appeal rights for employees in the newly created \u201cSchedule Policy/Career.\u201d This directly contravenes statutory provisions and invites legal challenge for arbitrary and capricious rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\n\n2. The Proposal Misinterprets \u201cPolicy-Influencing\u201d Roles and Expands Presidential Authority Unlawfully\nThe 2024 final rule reaffirmed that the statutory exception for positions of a \u201cconfidential or policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\u201d applies to noncareer political appointees, not to career civil servants. Congress never intended the President to unilaterally reclassify career employees into at-will roles without due process.\n\nThe proposed rule seeks to expand this narrow exception and allow the President to remove protections from broad swaths of the career workforce based solely on undefined notions of \u201cpolicy influence.\u201d This blurs the line between political and career service and risks politicizing positions that have historically been insulated from partisan control.\n\n3. Due Process Protections Cannot Be Revoked Without Violating the Constitution\nUnder long-standing Supreme Court precedent, including Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, once the government grants employees a property interest in their job through cause-based removal procedures, it cannot strip that interest without affording due process. This proposed rule strips due process rights from career employees without any individual finding of misconduct or incompetence, raising serious constitutional due process concerns.\n\n4. The Justification for the Rule Is Unsupported by Evidence\nThe proposed rule relies on unsubstantiated claims that the current system prevents agencies from addressing misconduct or poor performance. Yet OPM\u2019s 2024 rule and the accompanying regulatory analysis explain that agencies already have sufficient tools under chapters 43 and 75 to take corrective or disciplinary action. As noted in the 2024 final rule, these procedures \u201cpromote the efficiency of the service\u201d while balancing the public\u2019s interest in a competent and independent civil service (89 FR 24984\u201324985).\n\nMoreover, the 2024 rule received over 4,000 comments, with approximately 67 percent in support, affirming broad public and stakeholder consensus that civil service protections should be preserved\u2014not dismantled.\n\n5. The Rule Will Undermine Recruitment, Retention, and Public Trust\nEliminating civil service protections will create a chilling effect among current federal employees and discourage talented professionals from seeking public service roles. The 2024 rule aptly noted that job applicants \u201cneed to know they will be valued for their knowledge, skills, and abilities\u201d and \u201cencouraged to offer their candid opinions\u201d without fear of reprisal (89 FR 24984). If career roles can be arbitrarily reclassified and stripped of due process, the federal government will lose credibility and its ability to compete for top talent.\n\nConclusion\nThe proposed rule not only violates statutory and constitutional protections but also undoes progress recently finalized through OPM\u2019s 2024 rule. It disregards Congressional intent, judicial precedent, and overwhelming stakeholder feedback. For these reasons, OPM should withdraw the proposed rule in its entirety.",

The Rule Will Undermine Recruitment, Retention, and Public Trust\nEliminating civil service protections will create a chilling effect among current federal employees and discourage talented professionals from seeking public service roles. The 2024 rule aptly noted that job applicants \u201cneed to know they will be valued for their knowledge, skills, and abilities\u201d and \u201cencouraged to offer their candid opinions\u201d without fear of reprisal (89 FR 24984). If career roles can be arbitrarily reclassified and stripped of due process, the federal government will lose credibility and its ability to compete for top talent.\n\nConclusion\nThe proposed rule not only violates statutory and constitutional protections but also undoes progress recently finalized through OPM\u2019s 2024 rule. It disregards Congressional intent, judicial precedent, and overwhelming stakeholder feedback. For these reasons, OPM should withdraw the proposed rule in its entirety.",

This proposal raises profound separation of powers concerns and violates the major questions doctrine, as articulated by the Supreme Court in cases such as West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587 (2022), and Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302 (2014).\n\n1. The Rule Presents an Extraordinary and Politically Significant Shift in Civil Service Policy\nThe proposed rule allows the Executive Branch\u2014through unilateral presidential decision-making and agency petition\u2014to reclassify civil service positions into a newly created \u201cSchedule Policy/Career.\u201d This reclassification eliminates the statutory due process protections that have governed removals of career civil servants for over a century. It effectively converts protected, merit-based roles into at-will positions without congressional authorization or individual findings of misconduct or poor performance.\n\nThis is a major restructuring of the federal civil service, a domain that has been carefully regulated by Congress through statutes such as the Pendleton Act, the Lloyd-La Follette Act, and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. It raises major questions about whether the Executive Branch may, through regulation, eliminate statutory protections for thousands of employees and reassign them into a classification that bypasses the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and other procedural safeguards.\n\n2. Congress Has Not Clearly Authorized Such a Sweeping Regulatory Action\nUnder the major questions doctrine, an agency must point to \u201cclear congressional authorization\u201d for regulatory action that addresses issues of vast \u201ceconomic and political significance\u201d (West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. at 2609). OPM has not and cannot identify any such express authority in the civil service statutes that allows it\u2014or the President\u2014to strip career employees of their procedural rights en masse by reclassifying their positions into a different personnel schedule.\n\nThe relevant statutes (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2101, 7511, 7513, and 4303) grant limited authority for managing personnel systems, but they do not authorize the wholesale conversion of protected roles into unprotected ones. In fact, these laws enshrine procedural and appeal rights that OPM now proposes to remove by regulation\u2014an action that directly conflicts with statutory text.\n\n3. The Rule\u2019s Justification Rests on General Policy Preferences, Not Statutory Authority\nOPM\u2019s explanation for the rule focuses on the perceived need for greater managerial flexibility and responsiveness to presidential directives. However, under the major questions doctrine, policy rationales cannot substitute for clear statutory authorization. The Supreme Court has made clear that agencies may not assume sweeping regulatory powers based on ambiguous or broad language, especially in areas of longstanding congressional regulation.\n\nIn this case, Congress has spoken repeatedly and with specificity about the standards for removing civil servants, the definition of competitive and excepted service, and the conditions under which an employee may be transferred or reassigned. OPM cannot override these standards through its own interpretation or via presidential order. To do so would render entire chapters of Title 5 meaningless.\n\n4. The Rule Risks Constitutional Conflict and Institutional Destabilization\nAllowing the Executive Branch to unilaterally reclassify protected roles as at-will positions raises grave constitutional concerns under the nondelegation doctrine and due process principles. But even if constitutional questions could be avoided, the rule's lack of clear statutory grounding triggers the major questions doctrine and renders the rule ultra vires.\n\nThis is not a minor procedural adjustment. It would fundamentally reshape the federal workforce, reverse over a century of bipartisan civil service reform, and politicize thousands of roles that Congress has explicitly shielded from partisan influence.\n\nConclusion\nBecause the proposed rule addresses a matter of vast political and institutional significance, and because Congress has not clearly authorized the sweeping changes it would implement, the major questions doctrine requires its rejection. OPM may not promulgate a rule that alters the structure of the civil service and abrogates statutory protections without a clear mandate from Congress.\n\nFor these reasons, the proposed rule must be withdrawn.",

    "comment": "I firmly oppose the implementation or reintroduction of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal poses a direct threat to the merit-based civil service system that has undergirded a competent, apolitical federal workforce for well over a century.\n\nForemost, the establishment of Schedule F fundamentally undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, enacted to eradicate the patronage system and enshrine merit as the basis for federal employment. The proposal would permit the reclassification\u2014and potential removal without cause\u2014of a wide array of career civil servants, particularly those involved in policy-making or policy analysis. This invites political interference into roles that must remain impartial and violates 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which affirms that federal employment decisions must be merit-based and free from political coercion.\n\nMoreover, the vague and expansive criteria for determining Schedule F eligibility violate the due process safeguards set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which ensures cause and procedural fairness in adverse personnel actions. Revoking these protections would undermine both transparency and accountability, while suppressing dissent and expert input\u2014thereby impairing the government\u2019s operational integrity and long-term efficacy.\n\nThe proposal also conflicts with the statutory mission of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., which is charged with preserving the merit system principles. Schedule F would subject career employees to undue political pressures, compromising the continuity, neutrality, and professionalism essential to federal programs across administrations.\n\nAdditionally, the manner in which Schedule F would be implemented constitutes an overreach of executive authority. The framework effectively bypasses established checks and balances by denying agency-level input on whether a position should properly fall under Schedule F. This exclusion not only disregards institutional expertise but also weakens the procedural legitimacy of the classification process.\n\nFinally, this proposal sets a deeply concerning precedent. It directly contravenes Executive Order 14173, issued January 21, 2025, which mandates that all federal appointments and employment decisions be rooted in merit. Reviving Schedule F would defy this clear directive and send the damaging message that politically expedient reclassification may override foundational principles of public service. Such a move would undermine the rule of law and erode the professional civil service\u2019s independence.\n\nIn sum, Schedule F is incompatible with the principles of good governance, due process, and statutory fidelity. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory attempt to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "I am concerned that OPM-2025-0004, \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" and Schedule F, will cause more harm than good.\n\nToday it is often assumed that government workers enjoy much more job security than workers in the private sector.

    "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule aimed at \"strengthening employee accountability\" by amending civil service regulations related to adverse actions and excepted service classifications. While the stated goals of enhancing accountability and democratic responsiveness are laudable, the proposed changes, particularly the creation of \"Schedule Policy/Career,\" pose a significant threat to the nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service and could inadvertently facilitate politically motivated removals of career employees.\n\nThe proposal argues that current Chapter 43 and 75 procedures are overly burdensome, hindering agencies' ability to address poor performance and misconduct, and enabling some career employees to inject personal or political preferences into their official duties. While acknowledging that inefficiencies in performance management processes may exist, the proposed solution of stripping due process protections from a broad category of \"policy-influencing\" career positions is a drastic overreach with dangerous implications.\n\nThe creation of Schedule Policy/Career, which would allow for the at-will employment of individuals in these roles without the standard procedural protections and appeal rights, fundamentally undermines the principles of a merit-based, apolitical civil service. The proposal asserts that these positions will remain career appointments filled on a nonpartisan basis. However, the removal of critical safeguards against arbitrary or politically motivated dismissals creates a system ripe for abuse.\n\nThe definition of \"policy-influencing positions\" appears broad and potentially subjective. This ambiguity could allow for the reclassification of a wide range of career civil servants into Schedule Policy/Career, exposing them to removal based on perceived alignment with the current administration's political agenda rather than demonstrable poor performance or misconduct. This would inevitably chill independent analysis and advice, as career experts may fear reprisal for offering views that diverge from the prevailing political winds.\n\nThe argument that this change is necessary to prevent the insertion of \"partisan or personal preferences\" into official duties is particularly concerning. Existing regulations and ethical guidelines already prohibit such behavior, and mechanisms exist to address legitimate instances of misconduct or poor performance under current Chapter 43 and 75 procedures. The proposed rule risks conflating legitimate policy disagreements or nuanced professional judgment with partisan bias, potentially leading to the dismissal of dedicated civil servants for simply holding different perspectives or offering objective, evidence-based recommendations that may not align with political priorities.\n\nFurthermore, the historical context cited in the proposal, referencing a period before general appeal rights for federal employees, is not a sound basis for rolling back decades of established due process protections designed to ensure fairness and prevent political manipulation of the civil service. The evolution of civil service law towards greater employee rights reflects a recognition of the importance of a stable, professional, and nonpartisan workforce.\n\nThe proposal's assertion that this change will \"strengthen American democracy\" is paradoxical. A civil service where career professionals can be easily removed for reasons that could be perceived as political undermines the very foundation of a government that operates based on expertise, continuity, and the rule of law, rather than the whims of political cycles. The institutional knowledge and experience held by career federal employees are invaluable assets that ensure consistent and effective governance across administrations. The proposed rule risks eroding this expertise through the creation of a climate of fear and instability.\n\nIn conclusion, while the need for effective performance management within the federal government is acknowledged, the proposed rule, with its creation of Schedule Policy/Career and the removal of due process protections for a potentially broad range of career employees, represents a dangerous step towards the politicization of the civil service. This would undermine the merit system principles, discourage objective analysis, and ultimately weaken the capacity of the federal government to serve the American people effectively and impartially.

    "comment": "Concerns About the Proposal to Reclassify Civil Servants Under Schedule F  \n\nI am writing to express my deep concerns about the proposal to reclassify federal civil servants under Schedule F, a policy that would strip them of critical job protections and undermine the merit-based system that has been the foundation of our civil service for over a century.  \n\nThe document, *Legal Vulnerabilities of Schedule F*, highlights how this policy is not only a dramatic departure from longstanding civil service principles but also likely unlawful. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) was enacted to ensure that federal employment is based on merit, not political loyalty. Schedule F, however, seeks to expand the narrow exception for confidential and policymaking roles\u2014historically reserved for political appointees\u2014to potentially tens of thousands of career civil servants. This would effectively return us to the corrupt \"spoils system\" of the 19th century, where government jobs were handed out as political favors rather than earned through competence.  \n\nKey legal and constitutional issues with Schedule F include:  \n1. **Violation of the CSRA**: The policy misinterprets the statutory exception for confidential and policymaking roles, which has always been understood to apply only to political appointees, not career employees.  \n2. **Due Process Concerns**: The Fifth Amendment protects civil servants' property interest in their jobs once they have accrued tenure protections. Schedule F would unlawfully strip these protections without due process.  \n3. **Historical Precedent**: For decades, courts and administrations of both parties have upheld the principle that career civil servants cannot be reclassified out of their job protections after the fact.  \n\nSchedule F threatens the stability, expertise, and impartiality of our federal workforce. It would open the door to mass firings based on political allegiance rather than performance, destabilizing agencies and eroding public trust in government.  \n\nI urge you to oppose this harmful policy and uphold the merit system principles that have long safeguarded the integrity of our civil service. The legal and practical risks of Schedule F far outweigh any perceived benefits, and its implementation would set a dangerous precedent for the future of our democracy.  \n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue.\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\nLegal Vulnerabilities of\nSchedule F\nJanuary 2025\nIssue Brief\nIssue Brief governingforimpact.org\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDonald Trump and his allies\u2019 promises to gut the federal civil service have received\nsignificant attention. They have said they will purge the executive branch of staff who are\ninsufficiently loyal to the President and his political cause. In doing so, they will seek to\nreturn our government to a patronage system under which political allegiance, not merit,\nmatters most for federal employment. They have proposed numerous means of\naccomplishing this goal, including reducing the size of the federal workforce, relocating\nagency offices, and even abolishing agencies entirely. 1\nOne policy likely to figure prominently in the new administration\u2019s efforts is called \u201cSchedule\nF.\u201d Schedule F, first floated in 2020, would purport to strip vast swaths of the federal\nworkforce of procedural job protections and make them fireable at will. The Trump\ncampaign promised that \u201c[o]n Day One,\u201d Trump would \u201cre-issue\u201d an \u201cexecutive order\nrestoring the president\u2019s authority to fire rogue bureaucrats.\u201d 2\nThe threat of Schedule F is, by now, well known. Less attention has been paid, however, to its\nlegal vulnerability. Schedule F is very likely unlawful, both under Congress\u2019s civil service\nlaws and the Constitution. Federal law affords the vast majority of federal workers\nprotections against arbitrary or politically motivated firing. An exception to that rule applies\nto senior political officials, who naturally turn over at the start of a new administration.\nDonald Trump will seek to use that narrow exception to fire at will thousands of career civil\nservants. That dramatic and unprecedented policy, which would overturn the protections\nCongress established for federal employees, is unlawful. At any rate, even if the President\ncould remove broad swathes of the federal workforce from the civil service on paper,\nbedrock principles of due process\u2014embedded both in the civil service laws and the\nConstitution itself\u2014would bar the government from stripping federal employees of the job\nprotections they have previously accrued.\nIt is essential that civil servants\u2014as well as advocates, commentators, and the\npublic\u2014understand that Schedule F\u2019s vulnerability means its implementation is not a sure\nthing.\nThis Issue Brief explains why Schedule F is unlawful.\n1 See, e.g. , Steven Greenhouse, Project 2025\u2019s Plan to Gut Civil Service with Mass Firings: \u201cIt\u2019s Like the Bad Old Days\nof King Henry VIII , \u201d The Guardian (Sept. 25, 2024); Eric Katz, Trump\u2019s \u201cDOGE\u201d Commission Promises Mass Federal\nLayoffs, Ending Telework , Gov\u2019t Exec.

BACKGROUND\nFor much of the nineteenth century, the so-called \u201cspoils system\u201d governed federal\nemployment. Federal employees were hired and fired based on their political affiliation\nrather than their competence. It was a patronage system rife with corruption. Congress\neventually stepped in, enacting a series of laws over the last century and a half establishing\na merit-based system of federal employment. One of the most important of these is the Civil\nService Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d). 3\nThe CSRA establishes a set of \u201cmerit system principles\u201d for the federal workforce, including\nthat \u201cselection and advancement should be determined solely on the basis of relative ability,\nknowledge, and skills,\u201d and that federal employees \u201cshould receive fair and equitable\ntreatment in all aspects of personnel management without regard to political affiliation\u201d and\nbe \u201cprotected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political\npurposes.\u201d 4\nAs part of safeguarding federal employees from undue partisan influence, the CSRA\nprovides that an agency may only fire, demote, or issue a lengthy suspension to an employee\n\u201cfor cause,\u201d not for arbitrary or improper reasons. 5 And it must first provide notice of its\nreasons and an opportunity for the employee to respond. 6 The employee may then appeal\nthe action to a neutral federal adjudicator, the Merit Systems Protection Board. 7 If the Board\nrules against her, she may go to federal court. 8\nNot every employee gets these procedural protections. As relevant here, the CSRA carves\nout employees \u201cwhose position[s] ha[ve] been determined to be of a confidential,\npolicy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\u201d 9 This group, which we\u2019ll\nrefer to as \u201cconfidential and policymaking\u201d employees, may be fired at will\u2014that is, for any\nreason or no reason at all.\nThe confidential and policymaking designation has historically applied only to a small group\nof employees: political appointees. 10 Political appointees are those in high-level government\npositions who have no expectation of continued employment after the end of the\n3 For an overview of this history, see Upholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles, 89 Fed.

That distinguishes them from career\nemployees, whose tenures generally continue across administrations. Confidential and\npolicymaking positions held by political appointees are documented on a list known as\nSchedule C. 11\nSchedule F was designed to dramatically reduce the scope of the CSRA\u2019s protections. In\n2020, President Trump directed agencies to identify career employees who \u201cdischarge\nsignificant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating and implementing\nexecutive branch policy and programs\u201d as confidential and policymaking employees and\nplace them on a new list\u2014Schedule F. 12 The goal of the policy was to strip these employees\nof their CSRA tenure protections and make them fireable at will.\nThe incoming Biden Administration rescinded Schedule F before agencies could implement\nit, so its full scope never became clear. But Trump loyalists have suggested that it was\ndesigned to allow the Trump Administration to fire at will tens of thousands of employees\nwith substantive responsibilities. 13 That would eviscerate the federal civil service\u2019s merit\nsystem principles and return large parts of the federal workforce to the spoils system.\nThe Biden Administration, in addition to rescinding the Schedule F executive order, took\nadditional action to avoid this result. In 2024, the Office of Personnel Management enacted a\nrule providing that employees cannot be involuntarily stripped of their tenure protections,\nofficially interpreting the confidential and policymaking designation to refer to political\nappointees only, and instituting certain procedures agencies must follow to reclassify\nemployees. 1 4\nEven so, the second Trump Administration is certain to move quickly in restoring Schedule\nF. 15 While we do not yet know the precise form the policy will take, we expect that, as in\n2020, it will move to strip CSRA protections from numerous career employees on the\ngrounds that they occupy confidential or policymaking positions.\n11 See Off. of Pers.

SCHEDULE F IS UNLAWFUL\nSchedule F violates the CSRA and the Constitution.\nThe CSRA bars expanding the confidential and policymaking designation beyond political\nappointees. The CSRA does not extend removal protections to \u201can employee whose position\nhas been determined\u201d by the President \u201cto be of a confidential, policy-determining,\npolicy-making, or policy-advocating character.\u201d 16 But that phrase does not authorize the\nPresident to rove the executive branch for any employee who does substantive work.\nInstead, it has a specific meaning, established by the text and confirmed by years of\nunbroken practice: political appointees. Any effort to expand the reach of the exception\nbeyond that settled meaning would be contrary to law.\nThe terms \u201cconfidential,\u201d \u201cpolicy-determining,\u201d \u201cpolicy-making,\u201d and \u201cpolicy-advocating\u201d on\ntheir face refer to the sorts of high-ranking positions held by an administration\u2019s political\nappointees. Those are the employees principally responsible for determining, making, and\nadvocating federal policy. And, in this context, the term \u201cconfidential\u201d is best read to\ndescribe employees with close working relationships to senior principals. Especially when\ntaken together, these words connote leadership. Other federal statutes, in fact, draw an\nexplicit equivalence between confidential, policy-determining, policy-making,\npolicy-advocating positions and political appointee status. For instance, Section 349(d)(3)(B)\nof Title 6, which establishes an office within the Department of Homeland Security, provides\nthat \u201cthe term \u2018political appointee\u2019 means any employee who occupies a position which has\nbeen excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential,\npolicy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\u201d 17 There are several other\nstatutes that make this same equivalence. 1 8\nExtensive past practice confirms that the confidential and policymaking designation\ndescribes political appointees.

They consist, in the main, of the heads of\nexecutive departments, under secretaries and assistant secretaries, the members of the\nregulatory commissions, the heads of a few of the large bureaus engaged in activities with\nimportant policy implications, the chief diplomatic posts, and a limited number of other key\npositions.\u201d 2 1 Brownlow himself made clear in testimony before Congress that while\n\u201cpolicy-determining officers should be political officers\u201d who \u201cchange when the President\nchanges,\u201d \u201c[a]ll of the other positions should be career positions.\u201d 22 President Roosevelt\npursued this recommendation. 2 3\nDuring the Truman Administration, the influential first Hoover Commission (chaired by\nPresident Hoover) likewise equated the policymaking designation with political appointee\nstatus in \u201cpropos[ing] a far-reaching revision\u201d in the civil service laws \u201cto build a career\nservice which will select the best of our citizens on merit, free of political influence.\u201d 2 4 \u201cTop\npolicy-making officials must and should be appointed by the President. But all employment\nactivities below these levels . . . should be carried on within the framework of the\ndecentralized civil service system.\u201d 25 Later, during the Eisenhower Administration, a second\nHoover Commission emphasized the point, noting that \u201cthe term \u2018policy-determining\u2019 was\nused to describe positions which should properly be reserved for political executives.\u201d 2 6\nWhen President Eisenhower took office, his administration stated that the \u201ctypes of positions\nthat do not belong in the Civil Service System\u201d were \u201c[t]hose positions where the incumbents\nshould receive, in the interests of sound administration, a delegation of authority from the\n19 See generally Comment of Protect Democracy and Walter M.

During the\nKennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter Administrations\u2014that is, during the decades\nleading up to the CSRA\u2019s 1978 enactment\u2014the number of confidential and\npolicy-determining positions in the executive branch never exceeded 1,590. 29 And for its\npart, the Merit Systems Protection Board\u2014charged by Congress to adjudicate the legality of\nfederal personnel actions\u2014has long held \u201cthat the terms \u2018confidential, policy-determining,\npolicy-making, and policy-advocating\u2019 are a shorthand way of describing positions to be\nfilled by \u2018political appointees.\u2019\u201d 3 0\nThe \u201cbest reading\u201d of the CSRA is that the confidential and policymaking designation only\napplies to political appointees, but the Supreme Court has made clear that \u201cExecutive\nBranch interpretation[s]\u201d like these\u2014which prevailed \u201ccontemporaneously with enactment\nof the statute and remained consistent over time\u201d\u2014are \u201centitled to very great respect\u201d as\nwell. 3 1\nIndeed, Congress enacted the CSRA against this legal backdrop. The Hoover Commissions\u2019\nconstruction of the policymaking designation was discussed during floor debate on the\nbill. 32 And the House Committee responsible for the bill wrote expressly that the confidential\nand policymaking exception was meant to be largely coterminous with the list of positions\non Schedule C\u2014that is, political appointees. The \u201cexception for positions of a confidential,\npolicy determining, policy-making, or policy advocating character, is an extension of the\nexception for appointments confirmed by the Senate. These positions are currently placed in\nSchedule C . . . or filled by Non-Career Executive Assignment.\u201d 33 More generally, as\ndiscussed elsewhere in this Issue Brief, it is undisputed that the civil service laws were\nenacted to undo the spoils system, broadly entrench merit system principles across the\n27 White House, Press Release (Mar. 5, 1953), available at Protect Democracy Comment Attachment 1 , at 39.\n28 Executive Order 10,440, 18 Fed.

Schedule F, which disregards that\nwell-established limitation, is unlawful.\nOne way to think about Schedule F\u2019s illegality is through the lens of the major questions\ndoctrine. The doctrine, which the federal courts have wielded with increased force and\nfrequency in recent years, calls for skepticism when the executive branch purports to newly\nlocate a sweeping, consequential authority in a longstanding statute. The doctrine is based\non the inference that Congress does not hide \u201celephants\u201d (vast new authority) in\n\u201cmouseholes\u201d (\u201clittle-used\u201d or \u201cancillary\u201d statutes). 3 5\nThis mode of reasoning confirms that Schedule F exceeds the President\u2019s statutory\nauthority. 36 For the first time, a President would claim to find in the modest power to\ndesignate confidential and policymaking positions\u2014which has only ever been applied to\npolitical appointees\u2014the authority to remove civil service protections from many career\nfederal employees with substantive responsibilities. That would topple the CSRA\u2019s merit\nsystem principles and unilaterally return the United States to the spoils system of federal\nemployment. President Trump would use a narrow carveout from the CSRA to, in effect,\nrepeal a great deal the Act itself\u2014to \u201ceffectuate[] a fundamental revision of the statute.\u201d 37\nThat is exactly the sort of elephants-in-mouseholes mismatch the major question doctrine\naddresses.\n34 Upholding Civil Service Protections, 89 Fed.

It is not possible to believe that Congress hid in the\nCSRA\u2019s narrow exception the power to decimate the civil service. Such a view would not\ncomport with \u201ccommon sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate a\npolicy decision of such economic and political magnitude.\u201d 3 8\nA civil servant may not be stripped of job protections. There is another reason Schedule F is\nunlawful. Even if President Trump were empowered to broadly classify career employees as\nholding confidential and policymaking positions\u2014which he is not\u2014both the Constitution\nand the CSRA would prohibit him from actually carrying out at-will firings. That is because\nonce a civil servant obtains statutory job protections, they may not be stripped away.\nThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause prohibits the federal government from depriving\na person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Generally, tenure protections\nfor public employees create an expectation of continued employment that counts as\n\u201cproperty\u201d for due process purposes. 39 The CSRA\u2019s removal restrictions have been held to\ncreate this kind of constitutional property interest. 40 And the Due Process Clause provides\nthat the government \u201cmay not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of such an interest,\nonce conferred, without appropriate procedural safeguards.\u201d 4 1 In the public employment\ncontext, that means pre-termination notice and an opportunity for a hearing. 4 2\nThe upshot is that federal civil servants, once granted CSRA protections, may not be fired (or\notherwise deprived of their CSRA rights) without procedures closely tracking those the\nCSRA requires. Schedule F, by purporting to strip numerous civil servants of their tenure\nprotections, blatantly violates that rule.\nLikewise, under the CSRA, federal employees may not be stripped of their job protections.\nFor more than half a century, the courts and the executive branch have agreed that under\nthe civil service statutes, once federal employees obtain tenure protections, they retain\nthem\u2014even if their positions are reclassified as confidential and policymaking.\nIn the 1950s, the Eisenhower Administration sought to remove certain employees from the\n\u201cclassified civil service\u201d\u2014a group on whom the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, the civil service statute\n38 FDA v.

One of those employees was then fired without notice or reasons. In Roth v. Brownell ,\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that notwithstanding the government\u2019s\nreclassification of the employee, he was entitled to the civil service law\u2019s protections.\n\u201cNeither the formula of \u2018excepting\u2019 the kind of position a person holds, nor any other\nformula, can obviate the requirements of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act that [n]o person in the\nclassified civil service of the United States shall be removed therefrom without notice and\nreasons given in writing.\u201d 4 3\nRoth \u2019 s logic extends to Schedule F. The CSRA provides that an employee may only be\nterminated for cause, after notice and an opportunity to be heard. Firing an employee\nwithout notice or reasons violates that requirement. And it makes no difference that\nSchedule F will purport to remove these protections before any particular firing takes place.\nRoth rejected the argument that Roth was not \u201cremoved\u201d from the civil service within the\nmeaning of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act because the Eisenhower Administration had previously\nmoved his position to a civil service category outside of the Act\u2019s protections. 4 4 \u201cThis is a\nparadox. Roth was once in the classified civil service, did not leave it voluntarily, and is now\nout of it. It follows that he was removed from it.\u201d 45\nFollowing Roth , the executive branch developed a consistent position\u2014matinained for\nnearly 70 years\u2014that a civil servant retains tenure protections even after her position is\nreclassified into an unprotected civil service category. 46 As a representative example, the\nReagan Administration\u2019s Office of Personnel Management explained that, under the CSRA,\nwhile political appointees in confidential and policymaking positions generally \u201cmay be\nseparated at any time,\u201d there is an exception for \u201cthose who were serving in a\n[tenure-protected] position . . . when OPM authorized its conversion to Schedule C and who\n43 Roth v.

    "original_comment": "Concerns About the Proposal to Reclassify Civil Servants Under Schedule F  \n\nI am writing to express my deep concerns about the proposal to reclassify federal civil servants under Schedule F, a policy that would strip them of critical job protections and undermine the merit-based system that has been the foundation of our civil service for over a century.  \n\nThe document, *Legal Vulnerabilities of Schedule F*, highlights how this policy is not only a dramatic departure from longstanding civil service principles but also likely unlawful. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) was enacted to ensure that federal employment is based on merit, not political loyalty. Schedule F, however, seeks to expand the narrow exception for confidential and policymaking roles\u2014historically reserved for political appointees\u2014to potentially tens of thousands of career civil servants. This would effectively return us to the corrupt \"spoils system\" of the 19th century, where government jobs were handed out as political favors rather than earned through competence.  \n\nKey legal and constitutional issues with Schedule F include:  \n1. **Violation of the CSRA**: The policy misinterprets the statutory exception for confidential and policymaking roles, which has always been understood to apply only to political appointees, not career employees.  \n2. **Due Process Concerns**: The Fifth Amendment protects civil servants' property interest in their jobs once they have accrued tenure protections. Schedule F would unlawfully strip these protections without due process.  \n3. **Historical Precedent**: For decades, courts and administrations of both parties have upheld the principle that career civil servants cannot be reclassified out of their job protections after the fact.  \n\nSchedule F threatens the stability, expertise, and impartiality of our federal workforce. It would open the door to mass firings based on political allegiance rather than performance, destabilizing agencies and eroding public trust in government.  \n\nI urge you to oppose this harmful policy and uphold the merit system principles that have long safeguarded the integrity of our civil service. The legal and practical risks of Schedule F far outweigh any perceived benefits, and its implementation would set a dangerous precedent for the future of our democracy.  \n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nMy further comments and questions on this matter are attached. \n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\nI strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal\nemployees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a\nprofessional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service\nReform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a\nmerit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil\nservants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and\npotentially terminated without cause opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This\nis antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8),\nwhich mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political\ninfluence.\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process\nprotections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for\nthe removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections\nnot only weakens accountability but also risks forfeiting expert advice and dissent within\nagencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to\nsupport the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission\nand places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and\ncontinuity of federal programs across administrations.\nThe Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good\ngovernance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM\nto reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous\nclassification.\nI also have the following questions regarding Schedule F:\n1. What is meant by \u201cmanagement officials\u201d? What or who all does this include? Does this mean\nGS-14 and above? GS-13 and above? Only SES?\n2. What is meant by the following as it is written in such a way that it is unclear and confusing:\n\"The proposed regulations further clarify that employees filling excepted service positions are in\nthe excepted service, regardless of whether they retain competitive status, and lists increasing\naccountability to the President as grounds for excepting positions from the competitive service.\"\nWho or what positions does this refer to?\n3. What safeguards are in place so that due process is not affected if such positions as\ninvestigators and officers are now \"at will\" employment?\n4. What is meant by \"technically\" in the following statement: \"Assuming arguendo that the\npolicy-influencing terms should be construed as a term of art for political appointees, that would\nsimply mean that all positions the President determines are policy-influencing are technically\npolitical positions.\" Does this mean that these positions are already political positions or that\nthey are only sometimes political positions? What percentage of positions in this scenario are\nexpected to be changed to a \"political position\" designation? Is there a cap? If the designation\nfor these positions can be changed by the President can they then be reverted or once changed\nit cannot be undone?\n5. The wide swath that Schedule F is proposing to cover seemingly includes all positions at the\nGS-13 level and above. Positions at this level include such titles as physicians, psychologists,\nfinancial analysts, firefighters, pilots, and dentists just to name a few positions. What justification\nis there for designating positions like these as Schedule F? What benefit is there for changing\ntheir designation? In what way would changing the designation for, say a pilot, improve the\nefficiency of a pilot? A firefighter? A physician? So on and so forth.\n6. What is the list of all positions that Schedule F would affect? Will agencies see some\npositions, even if they are the same position, be designated as political positions and others will\nnot? What is the criteria for deciding this?\n7. What is meant by the following as it is unclear: \"In its place OPM proposes a new paragraph\n(b) that provides that an employee who has competitive status at the time their position is first\nlisted in an excepted service schedule, or who is involuntarily transferred to a position in the\nexcepted service, is not in the competitive service for any purpose but shall retain competitive\nstatus for as long as they continue to occupy such position.\" Please provide examples that\nclearly demonstrate what is trying to be achieved by this.\n8. The proposal states, \"Upon further review, and in consideration of the policies set out in\nExecutive Order 14171, OPM has concluded that these fears were misplaced. This order rejects\nthe spoils system and seeks to return to the efficient, merit-based system enacted by the\nPendleton Act.\" How is a position now merit-based if it is being designated a political position\nand therefore then can be influenced by the President?\n9. The proposal states, \"As OPM and commentators previously noted, hiring less qualified\npersonnel reduces Federal administrative capacity and efficiency. Replacing experienced career\nemployees who are faithfully implementing Presidential directives with inexperienced political\nappointees would make it significantly more difficult for him to carry out his agenda.\" The current\nhiring process is rigorous and attuned to each agency\u2019s needs. What new criteria would then be\nimplemented that assures qualified individuals are being placed and retained in these positions?\n10. The proposal states, \"OPM also notes that the President and his appointees have additional\nincentives to maintain a career workforce that contains a diversity of views and opinions.\"\nHowever, the proposal also advises that the goal of Schedule F is to place individuals who allign\nwith the President's policies in these career workforce positions. How then can the workforce be\nboth diverse in views and opinions but also allign with the Presidents policies? Wouldn't this\ncreate an echo chamber of views and opinions and therefore no longer be diverse?\n\n\n",

    "comment": "\n\nsee attached.\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\nDear Director Ahuja:\nI write to express strong opposition to the proposed rule establishing \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d\nwithin the excepted service. In addition to the well-documented violations of the Administrative\nProcedure Act and constitutional concerns, this proposal raises a range of operational, policy,\nand workforce integrity issues that have not been adequately addressed in the rulemaking\nrecord.\n1. Vague Definition of \u201cPolicy-Influencing\u201d\nThe proposed rule does not clearly define what constitutes a \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d position. This\nlack of precision invites inconsistent application across agencies, encourages subjective and\npotentially political decision-making, and could result in the misclassification of technical,\nanalytical, or support roles that do not meaningfully shape policy. Without a clear standard, the\nrule cannot be fairly or predictably implemented.\n2. Absence of Safeguards Against Political Abuse\nBy removing Title 5 protections from select career employees and allowing reclassification at the\ndiscretion of political leadership, the rule creates a pathway to politicize the career workforce.\nThis undermines the long-standing separation between political and career service and\ncontravenes the principles enshrined in the Pendleton Act and Civil Service Reform Act. The\nlack of internal or external checks creates a serious risk of retaliatory or ideologically motivated\nremovals.\n3. Erosion of Whistleblower Protections\nAlthough the rule asserts that whistleblower protections remain intact, the elimination of due\nprocess rights\u2014such as notice, reply, and appeal\u2014will in practice deter employees from\nreporting misconduct. If employees fear that exposing wrongdoing could lead to at-will\ntermination without recourse, the effectiveness of whistleblower laws will be severely\ndiminished. The rule thus has a chilling effect on internal accountability and ethical governance.\n4. Unfunded and Unanalyzed Implementation Burden\nThe proposal will require extensive new classification work, interagency coordination, and White\nHouse involvement in personnel decisions. OPM has not estimated the staffing, cost, or training\nburden associated with these changes, nor has it addressed the challenges smaller agencies\nwill face in meeting these new demands. This implementation burden has been ignored in the\ncost-benefit analysis, distorting the rule\u2019s practical feasibility.\n5. No Transition Plan for Affected Employees\nThe rule does not explain how or when affected employees will be reclassified, whether current\nincumbents will retain existing rights, or how disputes over classification will be handled. This\nlack of a transition plan creates significant legal uncertainty and workforce disruption,\nparticularly for long-serving employees whose job security could change overnight.\n6. Conflicts with Collective Bargaining Agreements\nReclassifying unionized employees without negotiation violates the principles of Chapter 71 of\nTitle 5, governing labor-management relations. The rule does not discuss how it will reconcile\nthis major reorganization with existing collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), raising the\nlikelihood of grievances, arbitration, and litigation.\n7. Damage to Recruitment, Retention, and Diversity Efforts\nThis rule signals that career federal employment is no longer stable or protected from political\ninfluence. That message will discourage talented professionals from joining the public sector,\nparticularly those with options in academia, law, or private industry. It also undermines efforts to\nbuild a workforce that reflects the diversity of the nation by making public service less appealing\nto historically underrepresented groups who often value job security and procedural fairness.\n8. Potential International Consequences\nIn regulatory and scientific agencies, U.S. civil servants routinely engage with foreign\ncounterparts to implement treaties, harmonize safety standards, and uphold international\nobligations. Politicizing technical and policy liaison roles risks weakening international\nconfidence in the neutrality and professionalism of the U.S. civil service. This could have ripple\neffects in areas like trade, food safety, public health, and environmental protection.\nConclusion\nThe proposed rule is more than a classification adjustment\u2014it is a fundamental reordering of\nthe relationship between career employees and political leadership. It creates operational\nchaos, legal uncertainty, and lasting damage to the credibility of the civil service. I urge OPM to\nwithdraw this rule and instead work with agencies, Congress, and the public to pursue targeted,\ndata-driven reforms that uphold accountability while preserving the integrity of the federal\nworkforce.\n\n\n",

Kennedy's Applicability Following the Civil Service Reform Act\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nI am writing to express significant concerns regarding the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" [Document ID: 2025-06904], particularly regarding its interpretation of the legal precedent established in Arnett v. Kennedy and its applicability following the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA).\nI. Mischaracterization of Arnett v. Kennedy's Legal Status\nThe NPRM incorrectly asserts that Arnett v. Kennedy's holdings should be disregarded because it was decided before the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, suggesting the CSRA somehow nullified its constitutional due process analysis. In fact, the NPRM explicitly acknowledges that \"The Supreme Court also dramatically changed the legal landscape in Arnett v. Kennedy (1974). In that case the Supreme Court held that a federal employee has a constitutional due process interest in continued federal employment.\" Justia\nWhile the CSRA indeed replaced the Lloyd-La Follette Act with a new statutory framework, it did not\u2014and constitutionally could not\u2014eliminate the fundamental constitutional due process protections recognized in Arnett. As the Federal Register itself notes in related rulemaking: \"Congress, far from limiting or ending such rights, has enacted new statutes since Arnett, notably the CSRA and the Civil Service Due Process Amendments Act, conferring robust procedural rights on broader groups of Federal employees.\" Federal Register\nII. The CSRA Expanded Rather Than Diminished Due Process Protections\nThe NPRM's claim that the CSRA superseded Arnett v. Kennedy's constitutional analysis fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between statutory frameworks and constitutional rights. While it's true that \"The CSRA superseded the Lloyd-La Follette Act, repealing and replacing subchapter I of chapter 75 (where the relevant Lloyd-La Follette requirements were previously codified),\" this statutory replacement did not diminish constitutional protections. Justia\nIn fact, the CSRA codified and expanded due process protections that were previously established through case law, including Arnett. The CSRA \"reaffirmed the merit system selection process for competitive civil service employees and prohibited discrimination on the basis of political affiliation, race, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or disability.\" Ballotpedia It established additional oversight bodies, including the Merit Systems Protection Board, to ensure civil servants received due process.\nIII. Legal Analysis Errors in the NPRM's Treatment of Roth\nThe NPRM claims that \"OPM's analysis of Roth and its implementing regulations ignored the fact that the Lloyd-La Follette Act is not in effect and has not been for nearly half a century.\" Justia This argument misapplies basic principles of constitutional law by conflating statutory frameworks with constitutional protections.\nThe constitutional due process interests recognized in Arnett v. Kennedy do not depend on the continuing existence of the Lloyd-La Follette Act. Once the Supreme Court recognized that federal employees have constitutional due process interests in continued employment, subsequent legislation cannot remove those interests without explicitly doing so, and even then, would face constitutional scrutiny.\nIV. The CSRA's Enhancement of Due Process Rights\nThe NPRM selectively acknowledges that \"In some ways, the CSRA expanded on the Lloyd-La Follette Act's due process protections. The Lloyd-La Follette Act allowed appeals of removals but not suspensions or demotions. Under the VPA preference-eligible employees could appeal suspensions of greater than 30 days. The CSRA allowed appeals of suspensions of more than 14 days.\" Justia\nThis admission directly contradicts the NPRM's core premise that the CSRA somehow diminished the applicability of Arnett v. Kennedy. The CSRA actually codified and expanded the very due process protections that Arnett recognized as constitutionally required.\nV. Conclusion and Recommendation\nThe NPRM's interpretation of Arnett v. Kennedy's applicability following the CSRA is legally unsound and represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between statutory frameworks and constitutional protections. The CSRA did not supersede or diminish the constitutional due process requirements identified in Arnett\u2014it codified and expanded them.\nI strongly urge the OPM to reconsider this aspect of the proposed rule and acknowledge the continuing relevance of Arnett v.

While the rule aims to enhance accountability, it introduces serious risks to the integrity, fairness, and effectiveness of the federal workforce.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n1. Erosion of Merit-Based Civil Service\n\nThe proposal significantly weakens merit system protections.

Politicization of Policy Roles\n\nBy designating certain positions as \u201cpolicy-determining\u201d or \u201cpolicy-advocating\u201d and exempting them from civil service protections, the rule risks reintroducing political loyalty tests into what are supposed to be nonpartisan roles.

Elimination of Due Process\n\nSchedule Policy/Career employees would be denied the right to appeal disciplinary actions or terminations to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). This violates principles of procedural fairness and may expose the rule to legal challenges under the Fifth Amendment for depriving employees of property rights without due process.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n4. Lack of Evidence Justifying Reform\n\nThe rule does not present clear evidence that existing civil service protections prevent agencies from disciplining poor performers.

The proposal appears to be a solution in search of a problem, relying more on ideology than data.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n5. Harm to Morale and Recruitment\n\nAt-will employment could damage morale and foster a culture of fear.

Legal and Operational Risks\n\nThe proposal resembles the rescinded \u201cSchedule F\u201d initiative from the prior administration. That attempt faced significant public and legal opposition. This rule, similarly, invites litigation and operational disruption\u2014particularly if large numbers of roles are reclassified and protections are stripped away.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n7. Threat to Institutional Knowledge and Continuity\n\nMany policy roles require deep institutional memory and expertise. Making such roles at-will could destabilize agencies by enabling the wholesale removal of experienced professionals with each new administration. This undermines long-term planning, consistent governance, and evidence-based policymaking.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n8.

Such swings in federal personnel policy reduce confidence in OPM\u2019s ability to provide consistent, evidence-based governance of the civil service.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the proposed rule claims to improve accountability, it sacrifices core civil service values: merit, due process, nonpartisanship, and continuity.

This proposal unjustifiably reverses the reasoned and lawful framework established in OPM\u2019s April 2024 final rule, \u201cUpholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles\u201d (89 FR 24982), which properly reinforced long-standing statutory and constitutional protections for the career civil service.\n\n1. The 2025 Proposal Undermines Statutory Protections\nThe proposed rule seeks to move policy-influencing career positions into a newly created \u201cSchedule Policy/Career,\u201d making those roles at-will and stripping employees of their rights under 5 U.S.C. Chapters 43 and 75. This directly contravenes the text and purpose of those chapters, which were enacted by Congress to ensure due process in performance-based and adverse personnel actions. The 2024 final rule accurately interpreted these statutes, confirming that civil servants do not lose their procedural protections merely because their positions are reclassified\u2014especially when the reclassification is involuntary.\n\n2. The 2024 Final Rule Accurately Reflected Congressional Intent and Legal Precedent\nOPM's 2024 final rule was firmly grounded in legal precedent, legislative history, and merit system principles dating back to the Pendleton Act of 1883 and later codified in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. That rule rightly emphasized that Congress intended for policy-influencing exceptions to apply only to noncareer political appointees, not career civil servants. The 2024 rule also clarified that employees with accrued rights under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511 retain those rights, even when involuntarily moved between service schedules.\n\nThe 2025 proposal not only ignores these legal foundations\u2014it seeks to reverse them by resurrecting the core features of the legally dubious Schedule F. It would eliminate MSPB appeal rights and permit dismissals without just cause or notice, which is inconsistent with decades of court rulings, including Arnett v. Kennedy, Roth v. Board of Regents, and Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill.\n\n3. The Proposed Rule Misapplies the Concept of \u201cAccountability\u201d\nThe 2025 proposal claims that accountability is hindered by due process, but this ignores the existing tools already available to agencies. As OPM explained in 2024, supervisors can take prompt action under Chapters 43 and 75 to address misconduct or poor performance. The fact that those actions require documentation and fair procedures is not a flaw\u2014it is a constitutional safeguard and a cornerstone of public service.\n\nMoreover, the proposed rule\u2019s assumption that many civil servants act in opposition to Presidential directives is not only unsubstantiated, but also inflammatory and dangerous. It risks undermining the morale and independence of the very workforce that ensures continuity and competence across administrations.\n\n4. The Rule Will Have Chilling Effects on Federal Recruitment, Retention, and Integrity\nAs noted in the 2024 rule, a strong and independent civil service is essential to attract top talent. Applicants must be assured that they are selected based on merit, not politics, and that they will not be fired arbitrarily for expressing honest, professional opinions. The 2025 proposal would send the opposite message: that career employees serve at the whim of the President or agency heads, regardless of job performance or tenure. This would deter qualified candidates from entering public service and erode public confidence in government operations.\n\nConclusion\nThe 2024 final rule correctly upheld long-standing legal protections and reinforced the professional, nonpartisan integrity of the federal workforce. The 2025 proposed rule seeks to unravel those protections based on speculative and unsubstantiated claims. It is inconsistent with statutory text, legal precedent, and public interest.\n\nFor these reasons, I strongly urge OPM to withdraw the proposed rule and uphold the principles it reaffirmed just one year ago.",

    "comment": "I respectfully submit this comment urging the withdrawal of the proposed rule published on April 23, 2025 (90 FR 17182). The rule unlawfully undermines procedural rights conferred by statute, departs from long-standing legal interpretation, and conflicts with the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) own 2024 final rule, \u201cUpholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles\u201d (89 FR 24982). If finalized, this regulation will be vulnerable to legal challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution.\n\n1. Conflict with Statutory Framework\nThe proposed rule would reclassify \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d positions into a new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career,\u201d eliminating coverage under 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 and 75, and removing appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). This is incompatible with congressional intent and statutory text. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511, procedural protections apply to most career employees who have completed their probationary periods. The 2024 rule reaffirmed that reclassification does not extinguish these rights unless voluntarily waived by the employee.\n\nThe 2025 rule\u2019s interpretation\u2014permitting removal of career protections solely through reclassification\u2014constitutes a de facto repeal of statutory safeguards via regulation, which exceeds OPM\u2019s authority.\n\n2. Violation of Due Process\nUnder Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), and related precedent, government employees with a statutory entitlement to continued employment possess a constitutionally protected property interest. Procedural due process requires, at minimum, notice and an opportunity to respond before termination.\n\nThe proposed rule would eliminate these safeguards for employees in reclassified positions, enabling termination without cause or process. Courts have consistently held that such deprivation of a vested interest without adequate procedures violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.\n\n3. Major Questions Doctrine\nThe proposal implicates the major questions doctrine, as reaffirmed in West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587 (2022). By removing statutory protections for a large class of federal employees, the rule seeks to effect a policy change of vast economic and political significance\u2014without clear congressional authorization.\n\nThere is no express delegation in Title 5 permitting OPM or the President to bypass or nullify the procedural protections of chapters 43 and 75. On this ground alone, the proposed rule is ultra vires and should be withdrawn.\n\n4. Reversal of Legally Sound 2024 Final Rule\nThe April 2024 final rule clarified that the statutory exception in \u00a7 7511(b)(2) for \u201cconfidential or policy-determining\u201d positions was never intended to apply to competitively appointed career employees. That rule preserved procedural rights for employees involuntarily moved to the excepted service and provided appeal rights to the MSPB.

    "original_comment": "I respectfully submit this comment urging the withdrawal of the proposed rule published on April 23, 2025 (90 FR 17182). The rule unlawfully undermines procedural rights conferred by statute, departs from long-standing legal interpretation, and conflicts with the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) own 2024 final rule, \u201cUpholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles\u201d (89 FR 24982). If finalized, this regulation will be vulnerable to legal challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution.\n\n1. Conflict with Statutory Framework\nThe proposed rule would reclassify \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d positions into a new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career,\u201d eliminating coverage under 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 and 75, and removing appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). This is incompatible with congressional intent and statutory text. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511, procedural protections apply to most career employees who have completed their probationary periods. The 2024 rule reaffirmed that reclassification does not extinguish these rights unless voluntarily waived by the employee.\n\nThe 2025 rule\u2019s interpretation\u2014permitting removal of career protections solely through reclassification\u2014constitutes a de facto repeal of statutory safeguards via regulation, which exceeds OPM\u2019s authority.\n\n2. Violation of Due Process\nUnder Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), and related precedent, government employees with a statutory entitlement to continued employment possess a constitutionally protected property interest. Procedural due process requires, at minimum, notice and an opportunity to respond before termination.\n\nThe proposed rule would eliminate these safeguards for employees in reclassified positions, enabling termination without cause or process. Courts have consistently held that such deprivation of a vested interest without adequate procedures violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.\n\n3. Major Questions Doctrine\nThe proposal implicates the major questions doctrine, as reaffirmed in West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587 (2022). By removing statutory protections for a large class of federal employees, the rule seeks to effect a policy change of vast economic and political significance\u2014without clear congressional authorization.\n\nThere is no express delegation in Title 5 permitting OPM or the President to bypass or nullify the procedural protections of chapters 43 and 75. On this ground alone, the proposed rule is ultra vires and should be withdrawn.\n\n4. Reversal of Legally Sound 2024 Final Rule\nThe April 2024 final rule clarified that the statutory exception in \u00a7 7511(b)(2) for \u201cconfidential or policy-determining\u201d positions was never intended to apply to competitively appointed career employees. That rule preserved procedural rights for employees involuntarily moved to the excepted service and provided appeal rights to the MSPB. It was grounded in well-settled legal precedent, including Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974), and aligned with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\n\nThere has been no change in law or compelling justification to reverse this interpretation. The 2025 proposal represents an abrupt and unsupported policy shift, raising concerns under APA arbitrary and capricious review (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)).\n\nThe proposed rule exceeds OPM\u2019s statutory authority, violates constitutional due process, conflicts with controlling precedent, and undoes a lawful and well-supported regulatory framework finalized in 2024.

    "comment": "My full comment is in the document attached. \n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.docx]\nIntroduction\nThe Office of Personnel Management's proposed rule to create a new \"Schedule Policy/Career\" category represents a fundamental threat to the merit-based civil service system that has served America for nearly 140 years. While presented as an accountability measure, this rule would effectively strip thousands of federal employees of basic job protections, politicize the career civil service, and undermine the institutional knowledge and expertise needed for effective governance.\nConstitutional and Legal Concerns\nExecutive Overreach\nThe proposed rule asserts broad presidential authority to designate any \"policy-influencing\" career positions as at-will employees. However, this interpretation runs contrary to Congressional intent in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA). Congress created a balanced system with the Senior Executive Service (SES) for high-level policy positions while maintaining protections for career civil servants. The proposed rule distorts this statutory framework.\nDue Process Violations\nThe rule dismisses due process concerns by claiming that reclassification is a \"legislative\" rather than \"adjudicative\" action. This ignores that federal employees have a constitutionally protected property interest in their employment that has been repeatedly recognized by the Supreme Court since Arnett v. Kennedy (1974). Removing these protections from incumbent employees would likely face significant legal challenges.\nSelective Statutory Interpretation\nThe proposed rule engages in selective reading of 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2), focusing narrowly on the position's classification rather than considering statutory context and legislative history indicating that \"policy-determining\" positions referred primarily to political appointments. The rule contradicts decades of consistent MSPB interpretation on this matter.\nPractical Governance Concerns\nInstitutional Knowledge Loss\nThe rule would likely trigger significant departures of career civil servants with valuable institutional knowledge. According to a survey mentioned in the Washington Post, nearly half of senior federal employees indicated they would follow what they believed was best policy rather than directives they considered problematic. This signals potential mass departures if job protections are removed.\nReduced Government Effectiveness\nContrary to the rule's claims, removing job protections would likely decrease government effectiveness. Federal employees would fear offering candid professional opinions that differ from political leadership, leading to echo chambers and poorer decision-making. The governance value of having professionals willing to present contrary perspectives based on expertise would be lost.\nRecruitment and Retention Crisis\nThe proposed rule would severely damage the government's ability to recruit and retain top talent. The federal government already struggles to compete with private sector salaries; civil service job security has been a key competitive advantage. Creating a large class of at-will employees would exacerbate existing recruiting challenges.\nPolicy Resistance: A Manufactured Problem\nMischaracterized \"Resistance\"\nThe rule characterizes professional disagreement as improper \"policy resistance\" or \"insubordination.\" However, what's described often amounts to career officials providing expert advice or identifying implementation challenges\u2014precisely what they should do. Professional disagreement is not insubordination; it's essential to good governance.\nSelective Evidence and Anecdotes\nThe rule relies heavily on anecdotal accounts of \"resistance\" during the Trump administration without substantiating a systemic problem. It mischaracterizes academic literature on bureaucratic autonomy, suggesting that scholars who study bureaucratic behavior view it as problematic rather than an essential feature of democratic governance.\nChecks and Balances by Design\nInstitutional resistance to potentially illegal or unethical directives is a feature, not a bug, of our constitutional system. As Professor Jon D. Michaels has argued, administrative separation of powers within agencies serves as an important constitutional safeguard against overreach and abuse.\nPerformance Management: Better Alternatives Exist\nExisting Tools Underutilized\nThe rule claims current procedures make it impossible to remove poor performers, but the data shows this is exaggerated. Many managers simply don't use available tools effectively. Training and resources for better performance management would be more effective than dismantling fundamental job protections.\nContradictory Data\nThe rule cites Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey data showing that steps are rarely taken to address poor performers. However, it fails to mention that during the Trump administration, overall federal employee job satisfaction reached record highs (72% in 2020). This contradicts claims of a dysfunctional civil service requiring radical reform.\nPolitical Weaponization\nThe true concern is that \"poor performance\" will be redefined as \"disagreement with political appointees,\" not actual job performance deficiencies. This transforms a legitimate management concern into a tool for political purging.\nThe Spoils System in Modern Dress\nPractical Political Purge\nDespite claims that Schedule Policy/Career won't reintroduce patronage, the practical effect would be similar. Officials could be removed for \"failing to faithfully implement administration policies\"\u2014a subjective standard easily abused to punish those perceived as insufficiently loyal.\nHistorical Regression\nThe Pendleton Act of 1883 established the merit-based civil service precisely to prevent the problems that plagued the spoils system: corruption, inefficiency, and instability in government operations. The proposed rule would effectively return us to pre-Pendleton Act conditions for thousands of positions.\nUndisclosed Scope\nThe rule provides no clear parameters for which positions qualify as \"policy-influencing.\" OPM estimates up to 50,000 positions could be affected\u2014potentially 2% of the federal workforce\u2014but the actual criteria remain vague and could expand in application.\nConclusion\nThe proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule represents a thinly veiled attempt to politicize the civil service under the guise of accountability. It undermines core merit system principles, threatens due process rights, and would significantly damage government effectiveness and institutional knowledge. Rather than strengthening accountability, it would weaken our democratic institutions by eliminating crucial safeguards against political overreach. The proper approach would be to strengthen existing performance management systems and provide better training to managers, rather than dismantling fundamental civil service protections established over a century ago.\n\n",

    "comment": "I am writing to challenge the NPRM's claim that \"approximately 50,000 positions would be moved or transferred into Schedule Policy/Career, about two percent of the Federal civilian workforce.\" This estimate lacks credibility for several reasons:\nI. Expanded Scope Compared to Previous Schedule F Proposal\nThe current NPRM significantly expands the criteria for positions that may be included in Schedule Policy/Career compared to the previous Schedule F proposal. While Executive Order 13957 already used broad language, this NPRM adds additional \"guideposts\" expanding the potential scope even further. Federal Register For example, the NPRM now explicitly includes:\n\nAll supervisors and higher-level managers of Schedule Policy/Career employees\nEmployees with \"delegated or subdelegated authority\" from agency heads\nAnyone with \"discretionary authority in agency grantmaking\"\nAnyone involved in \"advocacy for administration policy\"\n\nDespite this expanded scope, OPM inexplicably maintains the identical 50,000 estimate from the previous Schedule F proposal. This inconsistency suggests the impact assessment was not actually re-calculated based on the broader criteria.\nII. Mathematical Inconsistency with OPM's Own Guidelines\nThe NPRM's guidance states that positions should be recommended for Schedule Policy/Career if they involve \"authority to bind an agency to a position, policy, or course of action without higher level review or with only limited higher-level review.\" Federal Register This definition potentially encompasses all management positions at the GS-14 and GS-15 levels, as well as many positions at the GS-13 level.\nGovernment data indicates there are approximately 130,000 employees at GS-14 and GS-15 levels alone. If even half of these meet the criteria, the 50,000 estimate would be exceeded before considering any of the other expanded categories. The mathematical inconsistency between OPM's own guidelines and its impact assessment undermines the credibility of the entire analysis.\nIII. No Methodology Disclosed\nThe NPRM states that \"The President may move a greater or smaller number of positions, but OPM believes this is a reasonable preliminary estimate.\" However, it provides no methodology or supporting data for how this estimate was calculated. Federal Register Without a transparent methodology, it is impossible for the public to evaluate the accuracy of this estimate or provide meaningful feedback on the rule's true impact.\nIV. Contradicted by Statements from Rule Proponents\nPublic statements from proponents of Schedule F (now Policy/Career) have indicated much larger numbers. The America First Policy Institute, which supports this rule, has published documents suggesting that at least 20% of the competitive service could potentially be classified under these criteria. Americafirstpolicy This would represent hundreds of thousands of positions, not the 50,000 claimed in the NPRM.\nV. Failure to Account for Cascading Effects\nThe NPRM fails to account for cascading effects of its own criteria. For example, by including \"both immediate and higher-level supervisors of Schedule Policy/Career employees\" for potential inclusion, each position moved creates additional positions eligible for inclusion. Federal Register This multiplicative effect means that the actual impact would almost certainly be much larger than estimated.\nVI. Conclusion\nThe NPRM's 50,000 position estimate lacks credibility and appears to be significantly understated. A proper regulatory analysis requires a transparent methodology and realistic assessment of impacts. Given the dramatic expansion in criteria compared to the previous Schedule F proposal, maintaining the identical estimate suggests this figure is arbitrary rather than evidence-based.\nI request that OPM withdraw this proposed rule and conduct a proper impact assessment with transparent methodology that accounts for the full scope of positions potentially affected under the expanded criteria. Without such analysis, the public cannot meaningfully evaluate the rule's true costs and benefits.",

Contradictory Internal Logic in the NPRM's Own Analysis\nThe NPRM's argument is fundamentally self-contradictory. While claiming these terms have their \"plain English meaning,\" the NPRM acknowledges that these terms originated in specific historical contexts and were carried forward with consistent meaning through successive administrations precisely because they had established meanings in civil service law. Justia This admission directly contradicts the claim that these are not terms of art.\nII. Ignoring Congressional Drafting Practices\nThe NPRM ignores established principles of Congressional drafting. The April 2024 final rule correctly observed that Congress uses these specific phrases as distinct from terms like \"career\" and \"non-career\" throughout the CSRA, consistently employing them to refer to political appointees rather than career civil servants. Federal Register When Congress uses specific, technical terminology repeatedly in a statute, this usage establishes these phrases as terms of art with precise meaning.\nIII. Misreading of Statutory Structure\nThe NPRM's argument that the policy-influencing terms in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) must include career employees because certain SES positions defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132 can include career positions with \"policy-making\" or \"policy-determining\" functions ignores critical differences in statutory context. Justia The SES provisions deliberately distinguish between career and non-career SES members, reflecting Congress's understanding that policy roles can exist in both categories - but crucially, Congress created separate adverse action procedures specifically for career SES members in subchapter V of chapter 75.\nIV. Ignoring Legislative History\nThe NPRM dismisses relevant legislative history that clearly establishes these terms as referring to political appointees. As noted in the April 2024 rule, the conference report for the Civil Service Due Process Amendments Act specifically describes these positions as having \"little expectation of continuing employment beyond the administration during which they were appointed\" - a description that can only apply to political appointees, not career civil servants. Federal Register\nV. Consistent Historical Application\nThe NPRM acknowledges that \"until Executive Order 13957 successive administrations had only used the policy-influencing exceptions for political appointments.\" Americafirstpolicy This consistent historical application across multiple administrations of both parties for over four decades is compelling evidence that these terms have an established meaning in civil service law as referring to political appointees, not career civil servants.\nVI. Implications for Statutory Interpretation\nIf the NPRM's novel interpretation were accepted, it would have far-reaching implications beyond just this rule. Numerous other statutes enacted after the CSRA use these same terms with the understanding that they refer to political appointments. Federal Register Redefining these terms would disrupt the carefully constructed framework of civil service law that Congress has built over decades.\nVII. Conclusion\nThe NPRM's claim that these policy-influencing terms are not terms of art represents a fundamental misreading of civil service law, ignores consistent historical usage, and contradicts Congressional intent. These phrases have specific, established meanings in federal employment law that cannot be casually redefined through administrative action.

As noted in materials on the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the civil service was designed to create a workforce with \"depth and wisdom that makes it more than a mere tool\" for executing policy.

In national security fields, intelligence analysis, public health, and other critical government functions, the loss of experienced personnel would be devastating. These fields require years of specialized training and accumulated knowledge that cannot be quickly replaced.\nWhile the NPRM claims it is designed to ensure \"employees perform well and faithfully implement the President's agenda,\" the actual effect would be to drive out experienced professionals with irreplaceable expertise.

    "comment": "Re: Procedural Deficiencies in Rescinding the April 2024 Final Rule\nI am writing to highlight significant administrative law deficiencies in this NPRM's approach to rescinding the April 2024 final rule.\nI. Failure to Satisfy State Farm Requirements\nThis NPRM violates principles established in Motor Vehicle Manufacturers v. State Farm. The NPRM claims the previous rule should be revoked because \"Executive Order 14171 has changed the underlying legal authorities.\" Federal Register This misunderstands the relationship between executive orders and regulations.\nAn agency rescinding a rule must provide reasoned analysis at least as detailed as would be required to adopt the rule initially. OPM attempts to bypass this by claiming Executive Order 14171 renders the previous rule \"inoperative\" without addressing substantive findings.\nII. Improper Reliance on Executive Order\nThe NPRM claims \"Executive Order 14171 rendered [previous definitions] inoperative.\" Federal Register This misunderstands the APA's requirements.\nProperly promulgated regulations have the force of law and cannot be nullified by executive order alone. If an agency wishes to rescind a regulation due to policy changes, it must follow APA requirements for reasoned decision-making.\nIII. Inadequate Consideration of Reliance Interests\nThe NPRM acknowledges reliance interests but dismisses them, stating \"policy benefits to the executive branch would outweigh them.\" Federal Register This fails to satisfy requirements in DHS v. Regents, which mandates reasoned explanation accounting for significant reliance interests.\nFederal employees made career decisions based on protections in the April 2024 rule. Agencies must \"be cognizant that longstanding policies may have engendered serious reliance interests\" (Encino Motorcars v. Navarro).\nIV. Inadequate Response to Prior Factual Findings\nThe April 2024 rule made specific factual findings regarding civil service protections. Federal Register Under FCC v. Fox Television, when a new rule contradicts previous factual findings, agencies must provide more detailed justification than for new policies.\nThis NPRM fails this standard, merely asserting OPM has \"reconsidered\" without providing new evidence justifying such a reversal.\nV. Improper Attempt to Override MSPB Appeals\nThe NPRM attempts to nullify the appeals process, claiming \"Executive Order 14171 terminated MSPB appeal rights under subpart F.\" Federal Register\nThis challenges separation of powers. An executive order cannot nullify established administrative appeal rights without following APA rulemaking procedures.\nVI. Conclusion\nThis NPRM violates administrative law principles by treating an executive order as automatically superseding regulations, failing to provide reasoned analysis, inadequately addressing reliance interests, and improperly attempting to terminate appeal rights outside the APA process.\nThese deficiencies render the proposed rule legally vulnerable. I urge OPM to withdraw it and pursue any policy changes in a manner consistent with administrative law.",

Such a move would erode the foundation of our merit-based civil service system\u2014a cornerstone of impartial and professional federal governance for more than a century.\n\nTo begin with, Schedule F stands in stark contrast to the spirit and intent of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. This landmark legislation was designed to dismantle the patronage system and replace it with a fair, merit-driven approach to federal hiring. Reclassifying policy-related career roles under Schedule F would enable their dismissal without just cause, paving the way for politically driven personnel decisions. This undermines the essential nonpartisan nature of civil service as protected under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which explicitly calls for federal hiring and firing to be based on merit, not political affiliation.\n\nAdditionally, the broad and ambiguous criteria for assigning employees to Schedule F violate due process rights established under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. These laws ensure that federal workers are afforded cause-based removals and procedural fairness\u2014protections that would be stripped away under this proposal. The result would be a chilling effect on the willingness of experts to offer candid advice, ultimately diminishing the effectiveness and integrity of government operations.\n\nFurther, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a statutory responsibility, outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., to uphold merit system principles. The implementation of Schedule F would be a direct contradiction of OPM\u2019s mandate and would place unwarranted political pressure on seasoned professionals, disrupting the stability and continuity of federal programs during transitions between administrations.\n\nIn summary, Schedule F represents a serious threat to the core values of effective governance, an independent civil service, and adherence to the rule of law. I call on the administration and OPM to firmly oppose any measures aimed at bringing this harmful classification into effect.",

These laws ensure that federal workers are afforded cause-based removals and procedural fairness\u2014protections that would be stripped away under this proposal. The result would be a chilling effect on the willingness of experts to offer candid advice, ultimately diminishing the effectiveness and integrity of government operations.\n\nFurther, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a statutory responsibility, outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., to uphold merit system principles. The implementation of Schedule F would be a direct contradiction of OPM\u2019s mandate and would place unwarranted political pressure on seasoned professionals, disrupting the stability and continuity of federal programs during transitions between administrations.\n\nIn summary, Schedule F represents a serious threat to the core values of effective governance, an independent civil service, and adherence to the rule of law. I call on the administration and OPM to firmly oppose any measures aimed at bringing this harmful classification into effect.",

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles.

    "comment": "I write to express strong opposition to the proposed rule published on April 23, 2025 (90 FR 17182), which would establish a new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d in the excepted service and eliminate key statutory protections for affected federal employees. This rule fundamentally undermines the structure and intent of the federal civil service system as established by Congress.\n\n1. The Proposed Rule Contravenes Congressional Intent\nCongress has repeatedly acted to safeguard the principles of a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service. The proposed rule directly contravenes that intent in at least four critical ways:\n\na. Undermining the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)\n\nThe CSRA established a comprehensive legal framework to ensure fairness, due process, and accountability in federal employment. By removing the procedural protections of 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 and 75\u2014including notice, documentation, and appeal rights\u2014the proposed rule seeks to undo these statutory safeguards for a broad category of career employees. This undermines the CSRA\u2019s central purpose: to protect civil servants from arbitrary and politically motivated adverse actions.\n\nb. Disregarding the 1990 Civil Service Due Process Amendments\n\nThrough the Due Process Amendments, Congress reaffirmed that most excepted service employees\u2014whether preference eligible or not\u2014should be covered by chapter 75 protections after an initial trial period. The proposed rule ignores this mandate by placing policy-influencing employees into a new at-will category, circumventing Congress\u2019s deliberate extension of due process rights to these positions.\n\nc. Eroding the Principles of the Pendleton Act\n\nThe Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 was designed to end the patronage system and enshrine merit-based hiring and protection from political retribution. By creating a broad class of at-will employees without appeal rights, this proposal risks reintroducing politicization into hiring and firing decisions\u2014particularly for positions critical to agency policy. This strikes at the heart of the Pendleton Act\u2019s mission and Congress\u2019s long-standing commitment to neutral competence in government.\n\nd. Overriding Legislative Safeguards Without Statutory Authority\n\nThe rule invokes Executive Order 14171 to repeal regulatory provisions issued just one year ago in the April 2024 final rule. However, the rule\u2019s legal justifications rest almost entirely on executive discretion rather than new statutory authority. This approach exceeds the proper bounds of executive rulemaking and usurps powers that Congress has explicitly retained. Agencies may not override statutory frameworks simply because a new administration favors a different policy direction.\n\n2. Congress Has Already Rejected Similar Proposals\nThe structure proposed here closely resembles \u201cSchedule F,\u201d which was introduced in 2020 and quickly met bipartisan resistance. Congress responded by introducing legislation such as the Preventing a Patronage System Act, signaling clear disapproval of efforts to create an at-will category of career civil servants without due process protections. Rebranding Schedule F as Schedule Policy/Career does not cure the underlying legal and policy flaws that Congress has already opposed.\n\n3. Conclusion\nThis rule is not a modest procedural change. It is a fundamental reordering of civil service protections that Congress has painstakingly built over more than a century. The proposal disregards statutory limits, eliminates essential due process rights, and opens the door to political interference in policy-making roles.\n\nFor these reasons, I urge OPM to withdraw this rule in its entirety. If OPM proceeds, it should at minimum extend the public comment period to the 60 days typically required under Executive Order 12866 for significant rules, so that the public can fully consider and respond to its sweeping implications.",

By allowing political leadership to reclassify large numbers of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy development or analysis\u2014this measure would remove critical job protections and expose federal employees to politically motivated hiring and firing. Though technical in nature, the implications are far-reaching and would fundamentally weaken the merit-based principles that have guided the civil service for over a century.\n\nThe U.S. has long relied on a professional, nonpartisan civil service. This system was born out of the Pendleton Act of 1883, which was designed to end the corrupt spoils system that once let politicians hand out government jobs to friends and loyalists. For over a century, federal jobs have been awarded based on merit, not political allegiance. Civil servants are hired for their expertise, and they\u2019re protected from being fired without cause\u2014so they can give honest advice and keep government running smoothly through political transitions.\n\nThe \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d classification would reverse that progress. It would let agencies reclassify civil servants in policy-related roles, removing due process protections and turning them into at-will employees. In practical terms, that means thousands of experts could be fired just for holding views that don\u2019t align with the current administration\u2014or simply to make room for political loyalists.\n\nThis proposal goes against the principles in U.S. law that protect civil servants from political coercion (see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 and \u00a7 7513). It also puts the Office of Personnel Management in a conflicted role, as it\u2019s tasked with upholding the very merit principles this proposal undermines.\n\nBut the problem goes deeper than legal conflict\u2014it\u2019s about how government works. If you politicize expert roles, you discourage facts, truth-telling, and long-term thinking. Employees may become afraid to speak up, especially when they\u2019re delivering unwelcome news. And when people are hired for loyalty instead of competence, the quality of decisions and public services suffers.\n\nThis affects all of us. If the people in charge of managing disaster responses, regulating food safety, or advising on health policy are chosen based on ideology instead of knowledge, the public is put at risk. Worse, the cost-benefit of government services could decline, as programs staffed by politically appointed loyalists are more likely to be inefficient, error-prone, or wasteful. We all end up paying more\u2014either in tax dollars or in poor outcomes\u2014for less effective government.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest: once this door is open, it won\u2019t close easily. While this kind of policy might be introduced under a conservative administration, a future democratic administration could just as easily use it to reward its own political allies. That\u2019s what makes this proposal so dangerous\u2014it\u2019s not about one party or one president. It\u2019s about breaking a system that protects us all by ensuring federal workers are focused on public service, not political loyalty.\n\nGovernment needs continuity, expertise, and stability\u2014especially in times of crisis. The \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d proposal would undermine all of that. It would erode trust, drive out talent, and make our civil service more about who you know than what you know.\n\nWe should reject this idea outright. Instead of weakening the federal workforce, we should be strengthening it\u2014by upholding merit, protecting impartiality, and keeping politics where it belongs: out of career civil service.\n\n",

    "comment": "I'd like to respond to the proposed OPM rule to create \"Schedule Policy/Career\" with a strong statement of opposition. This proposal raises serious legal, constitutional, and practical concerns that undermine fundamental principles of our civil service system. The proposed rule to create a \"Schedule Policy/Career\" classification fundamentally violates the separation of powers doctrine. By attempting to place career civil servants in at-will positions without statutory due process protections, this rule directly contradicts the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), which deliberately established a comprehensive framework of employee protections. The Supreme Court in Humphrey's Executor v. United States (295 U.S. 602, 1935) established critical limitations on presidential removal power, particularly for positions requiring independence from direct political control. This proposed rule attempts to circumvent these established legal principles.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed rule's historical account severely mischaracterizes the evolution of civil service protections. While early civil service laws focused primarily on merit-based hiring, the development of removal protections was a deliberate evolution to prevent politically-motivated firings and ensure a professional, non-partisan workforce. The rulemaking selectively cites historical precedent while ignoring key developments in civil service law. For example, in Arnett v. Kennedy (416 U.S. 134, 1974), the Supreme Court recognized that federal employees have constitutionally protected property interests in their continued employment. This proposed rule attempts to strip those constitutional due process protections from thousands of career employees.\n\nThis proposal would severely undermine government effectiveness by: 1) Creating a chilling effect on professional expertise and independent judgment, 2) Enabling politically-motivated removals disguised as performance issues, 3) Reducing institutional knowledge and continuity across administrations, and 4) Deterring qualified individuals from government service. The rule attempts to redefine \"policy-influencing\" positions to potentially include thousands of career civil servants who provide professional expertise rather than political advice. These employees implement laws passed by Congress, not partisan agendas.\n\nOPM lacks statutory authority to fundamentally alter the civil service system in this manner. The proposed redefinition of \"policy-influencing\" contradicts decades of established interpretation and exceeds OPM's regulatory authority. This rule represents a dangerous attempt to politicize the civil service and undermine the merit system principles that have been the foundation of effective government since the Pendleton Act. I strongly urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule and maintain the longstanding protections that ensure a professional, non-partisan civil service. The proposed rule should be rejected as contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, and fundamentally incompatible with constitutional principles and the statutory framework established by Congress. Fundamentally, members of the civil service serve all citizens of the United States and no administration should seek to alter that to serve a singular agenda. ",

By removing chapter 43 and 75 procedural protections for a potentially large segment of the workforce, the rule threatens the professional, non-partisan civil service that ensures continuity of government operations across administrations.\nCreating Workforce Instability: The introduction of at-will employment for \"policy-influencing\" positions would destabilize agencies by introducing significant employment uncertainty. This uncertainty would likely lead to increased turnover, loss of institutional knowledge, and difficulty recruiting and retaining talented professionals essential to government operations.\nUndermining Due Process: The elimination of MSPB appeal rights removes crucial due process protections that ensure employment decisions are based on merit rather than political or personal considerations. This change contradicts longstanding principles of fairness in federal employment.\nVague and Potentially Expansive Scope: The term \"policy-influencing\" is inherently broad and subject to interpretation. Without clear, narrowly tailored criteria, this designation could be applied to a vast number of career positions, extending far beyond roles that genuinely involve policy formulation.\nInhibiting Expert Advice: Federal employees must be able to provide candid, professional advice without fear of summary dismissal. This rule would create a chilling effect that discourages career employees from offering their best professional judgment when it may contradict political preferences.\nImpacts on Government Effectiveness\nThe proposed rule would likely have several negative impacts on government effectiveness:\nLoss of Expertise: The federal government requires seasoned professionals with specialized knowledge to fulfill its mission. The uncertainty created by this rule would lead to an exodus of experienced employees and difficulty attracting new talent.\nReduced Operational Continuity: Career civil servants ensure continuity of operations during transitions between administrations. Weakening their job security threatens this critical function.\nDiminished Morale: The proposed changes would significantly damage employee morale across agencies, as even those not immediately affected would face uncertainty about future reclassifications of their positions.\nIncreased Politicization: Rather than addressing legitimate performance management concerns, these changes risk introducing greater political influence into day-to-day government operations.\nWhile I recognize the importance of addressing performance management challenges in the federal workforce, this approach creates far more problems than it solves. I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule and instead work with stakeholders to develop alternative approaches that strengthen accountability while preserving the integrity of the merit-based civil service system.",

By removing chapter 43 and 75 procedural protections for a potentially large segment of the workforce, the rule threatens the professional, non-partisan civil service that ensures continuity of government operations across administrations.\nCreating Workforce Instability: The introduction of at-will employment for \"policy-influencing\" positions would destabilize agencies by introducing significant employment uncertainty. This uncertainty would likely lead to increased turnover, loss of institutional knowledge, and difficulty recruiting and retaining talented professionals essential to government operations.\nUndermining Due Process: The elimination of MSPB appeal rights removes crucial due process protections that ensure employment decisions are based on merit rather than political or personal considerations. This change contradicts longstanding principles of fairness in federal employment.\nVague and Potentially Expansive Scope: The term \"policy-influencing\" is inherently broad and subject to interpretation. Without clear, narrowly tailored criteria, this designation could be applied to a vast number of career positions, extending far beyond roles that genuinely involve policy formulation.\nInhibiting Expert Advice: Federal employees must be able to provide candid, professional advice without fear of summary dismissal. This rule would create a chilling effect that discourages career employees from offering their best professional judgment when it may contradict political preferences.\nImpacts on Government Effectiveness\nThe proposed rule would likely have several negative impacts on government effectiveness:\nLoss of Expertise: The federal government requires seasoned professionals with specialized knowledge to fulfill its mission. The uncertainty created by this rule would lead to an exodus of experienced employees and difficulty attracting new talent.\nReduced Operational Continuity: Career civil servants ensure continuity of operations during transitions between administrations. Weakening their job security threatens this critical function.\nDiminished Morale: The proposed changes would significantly damage employee morale across agencies, as even those not immediately affected would face uncertainty about future reclassifications of their positions.\nIncreased Politicization: Rather than addressing legitimate performance management concerns, these changes risk introducing greater political influence into day-to-day government operations.\nWhile I recognize the importance of addressing performance management challenges in the federal workforce, this approach creates far more problems than it solves. I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule and instead work with stakeholders to develop alternative approaches that strengthen accountability while preserving the integrity of the merit-based civil service system.",

As a career federal employee who was also raised by civil servants, I view this proposal as an existential threat to the merit-based foundations of the civil service and a dangerous politicization of roles that are \u2014 by law and by design \u2014 nonpartisan and professional in nature.\n\nThe United States civil service was established to ensure that federal employees are hired and retained based on merit, not political loyalty. The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 was enacted precisely to curb the abuses of the spoils system and ensure that federal employees serve the public interest, not the agenda of a single administration. The proposed rule undermines this legacy by opening the door to reclassification schemes that would allow political appointees to replace, remove, or exert undue influence over career officials \u2014 thereby reviving the very partisan pressures that civil service protections were designed to eliminate.\n\nIn particular, the rule appears to contemplate broad authority to reassign or reclassify career positions into roles exempt from competitive service protections, echoing the structure and language of former Executive Order 13957, which was rescinded in January 2021 for its potential to erode civil service neutrality. It is deeply alarming that OPM now seeks to revive similar frameworks through regulatory means. Not only does this violate the spirit of merit system principles enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301, but it also risks widespread disruption of agency operations and the politicization of day-to-day governance.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed rule makes it significantly easier to terminate career employees, potentially without adequate due process or independent review. This will discourage candid advice, stifle dissent, and create an atmosphere of fear and self-censorship within the workforce. It is antithetical to the oath that federal employees take \u2014 not to any individual or party, but to the Constitution of the United States.\n\nMoreover, the decision to allow only a 30-day comment period on a rule of this magnitude is deeply concerning. The implications of this rule extend across the entire federal government and affect the fundamental structure and stability of public service. Such a short window for public input fails to meet the standards of meaningful notice-and-comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, particularly given the substantial interest in and impact of the proposed changes. This strongly suggests a motive to implement the rule without sufficient oversight or public scrutiny.\n\nThe American public deserves a civil service that is competent, impartial, and insulated from political pressure. This rule threatens to replace expert governance with ideological conformity \u2014 a shift that would have far-reaching and potentially irreversible consequences for our democracy. Worse still, the drafters of this rule appear to ignore that any future administration, regardless of party, could exploit these mechanisms in ways that damage both the credibility and capability of government institutions.\n\nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety.

Schedule F undermines the foundational principle of a merit-based civil service by reclassifying policy-related roles as at-will positions, stripping them of critical job protections.\n\nThis reclassification politicizes the federal workforce, making it vulnerable to partisan loyalty tests rather than professional qualifications. Such a shift threatens the neutrality, expertise, and institutional continuity that are essential for effective governance.\n\nMoreover, Schedule F introduces instability into government operations by allowing mass turnover with each change in administration. This loss of institutional knowledge and increased politicization would impair the government's ability to serve the public efficiently and impartially.\n\nAccountability would also suffer. Without protections, employees may feel pressured to prioritize political agendas over public interest, and whistleblowers could face retaliation without recourse.\n\nLastly, the broad authority granted to define Schedule F roles raises the risk of abuse.

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation of Schedule F.  This proposed rule fails to provide any specific descriptions of which positions are policy influencing.  By being intentionally vague it allows a broad definition of what employees can be placed on schedule F.  The basis for proposing this rule is to make removal of underperformers easier, but that was already addressed with the new 30 day PIP rule. So what is the point of schedule F?  It appears that it is being proposed to allow hiring and firing based on politics instead of merit.  It also violates the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees.  It also undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which established merit based hiring of federal employees",

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees.

The merit-based civil service system is a cornerstone of effective, accountable governance and should remain protected from partisan influence. Politicizing the civil service would be detrimental to the public interest for several reasons, including:\n\n1.Undermines Professionalism and Expertise. The federal civil service is built on the principle of merit-based hiring and promotion. Politicizing this system would replace experienced, nonpartisan professionals with individuals selected for political loyalty rather than qualifications. This risks degrading the quality of public service delivery and compromising the government's ability to function competently.\n\n2. Threatens Government Continuity and Stability. Career civil servants ensure continuity in the administration of government functions during transitions between elected officials. Turning these positions into politically appointed roles would destabilize agencies, cause operational disruption, and result in the loss of critical institutional knowledge with each new administration.\n\n3. Erodes Public Trust. Public confidence in government relies on the perception that civil servants carry out their duties impartially and ethically. Politicization would cast doubt on the neutrality of agencies, potentially damaging the trust that citizens place in their government to act fairly and in the public interest.\n\n4. Opens the Door to Corruption and Patronage. A politicized civil service invites favoritism, patronage, and conflicts of interest. Political appointees without proper qualifications may be more susceptible to ethical lapses, undermining the integrity of public institutions and increasing the risk of corruption and mismanagement.\n\n5. Damages America\u2019s Global Credibility. U.S. government agencies are respected internationally for their competence and professionalism. Politicizing these institutions would weaken their effectiveness and credibility in global affairs, harming America\u2019s reputation and diplomatic capacity.\n\n6. Weakens Checks and Balances. Civil servants play a crucial role in upholding the rule of law and serving as a check on executive overreach. If those positions are filled based on political allegiance, the civil service may become an instrument of partisan agendas, reducing institutional accountability and undermining democratic norms.\n\n7. Reduces Morale and Drives Away Talent. Politicization would discourage talented individuals from entering or remaining in public service, knowing that advancement depends on political connections rather than merit. This would result in a brain drain from public institutions at a time when competent, dedicated civil servants are more essential than ever.\n\nPoliticizing the federal civil service is a mistake that undermines the integrity, competence, and continuity of government operations. I urge you to preserve the nonpartisan, merit-based structure that has served our nation well for over a century.\n\nSincerely,\nSteven Fondriest, Washington, DC\n",

The federal civil service is built on the principle of merit-based hiring and promotion. Politicizing this system would replace experienced, nonpartisan professionals with individuals selected for political loyalty rather than qualifications. This risks degrading the quality of public service delivery and compromising the government's ability to function competently.\n\n2. Threatens Government Continuity and Stability. Career civil servants ensure continuity in the administration of government functions during transitions between elected officials. Turning these positions into politically appointed roles would destabilize agencies, cause operational disruption, and result in the loss of critical institutional knowledge with each new administration.\n\n3. Erodes Public Trust. Public confidence in government relies on the perception that civil servants carry out their duties impartially and ethically. Politicization would cast doubt on the neutrality of agencies, potentially damaging the trust that citizens place in their government to act fairly and in the public interest.\n\n4. Opens the Door to Corruption and Patronage. A politicized civil service invites favoritism, patronage, and conflicts of interest. Political appointees without proper qualifications may be more susceptible to ethical lapses, undermining the integrity of public institutions and increasing the risk of corruption and mismanagement.\n\n5. Damages America\u2019s Global Credibility. U.S. government agencies are respected internationally for their competence and professionalism. Politicizing these institutions would weaken their effectiveness and credibility in global affairs, harming America\u2019s reputation and diplomatic capacity.\n\n6. Weakens Checks and Balances. Civil servants play a crucial role in upholding the rule of law and serving as a check on executive overreach. If those positions are filled based on political allegiance, the civil service may become an instrument of partisan agendas, reducing institutional accountability and undermining democratic norms.\n\n7. Reduces Morale and Drives Away Talent. Politicization would discourage talented individuals from entering or remaining in public service, knowing that advancement depends on political connections rather than merit. This would result in a brain drain from public institutions at a time when competent, dedicated civil servants are more essential than ever.\n\nPoliticizing the federal civil service is a mistake that undermines the integrity, competence, and continuity of government operations. I urge you to preserve the nonpartisan, merit-based structure that has served our nation well for over a century.\n\nSincerely,\nSteven Fondriest, Washington, DC\n",

While OPM contends that a \u201cmeaningful number of career employees insert their personal politics into their official duties,\u201d this justification fails to meet the legal and practical thresholds necessary to justify the dismantling of core civil service protections.\n\nFirst, if instances of political bias or insubordination among civil servants exist, there are already robust mechanisms in place to address such misconduct through the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), Office of Special Counsel (OSC), and agency-specific procedures under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Resorting to an across-the-board reclassification of policy-influencing positions to at-will status is an overly broad and legally questionable response. It amounts to collective punishment without individualized due process, raising significant constitutional concerns under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nSecond, OPM\u2019s recognition of \u201cbureaucratic partisanship\u201d does not provide a sound legal basis to eliminate due process protections for thousands of public servants. As the Supreme Court recognized in Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, the independence of certain federal employees serves a critical function in ensuring continuity, neutrality, and resistance to the politicization of core government functions. The proper execution of the law does not require total political obedience from civil servants, but rather faithful adherence to statutory duties and constitutional principles.\n\nThird, the President\u2019s assertion\u2014via Executive Order 14171\u2014that Schedule Policy/Career is necessary to ensure policy compliance fundamentally misunderstands the role of the career civil service. These employees are not political appointees; they are protected specifically to insulate the implementation of public policy from partisan interference. Conflating disagreement or due diligence with insubordination is dangerous. It opens the door to politicized purges of subject-matter experts and a degradation of institutional competence.\n\nUltimately, this proposal would return our civil service to a 19th-century spoils system, contrary to the merit-based principles enshrined in the CSRA. It is a blunt instrument aimed at a problem that is anecdotal at best and for which there are already effective remedies. I urge OPM to reject this proposal and instead focus on strengthening existing oversight and accountability mechanisms without sacrificing the nonpartisan integrity of the federal workforce.",

    "comment": "I oppose the proposed implementation. While OPM asserts that these positions will remain \u201ccareer\u201d and that their purpose is to reinforce accountability to the President, this distinction is ultimately unconvincing and fails to resolve core concerns about the erosion of the merit-based civil service.\n\nFirst, labeling a position as \u201ccareer\u201d while simultaneously making it subject to at-will dismissal based on subjective assessments of \u201cfaithful implementation\u201d of a President\u2019s agenda is a contradiction in terms.

    "comment": "Provided this comment a few minutes ago:\n\nThe proposed Schedule F classification raises significant legal concerns as it violates multiple federal statutes and constitutional protections designed to uphold a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service. Below is the detailed analysis of the legal issues associated with Schedule F:\n\n1.\t\u2060Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)\n\nThe CSRA establishes a merit-based system for federal employment, providing protections against arbitrary dismissal. Schedule F seeks to reclassify certain policy-influencing positions, effectively removing these protections and allowing for at-will termination. Reclassification undermines the CSRA\u2019s intent and structure. Notably, the CSRA permits exceptions for positions of a \u201cconfidential or policy-determining character,\u201d but Schedule F\u2019s broad application exceeds this narrow scope. The Roth v. Brownell decision reinforces that reclassification cannot strip employees of their CSRA protections without due process.\n\n\u00a02. Contravention of the Lloyd\u2013La Follette Act of 1912\n\nThis Act mandates that federal employees cannot be removed without notice and a written explanation. By converting positions to Schedule F, employees lose these procedural safeguards, conflicting with the Act\u2019s requirements. The Roth case further supports that reclassification does not nullify these protections.\n\n3. Potential Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment\n\nFederal employees have a property interest in their continued employment, protected under the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill affirms that due process is required before terminating such employment. Schedule F\u2019s provision for at-will dismissal without prior notice or hearing raises constitutional concerns.\n\n4. Breach of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\n\nThe APA requires that significant regulatory changes undergo a notice-and-comment period and that agencies provide a reasoned explanation for such changes. The implementation of Schedule F lacks sufficient justification and fails to adhere to APA procedures.\n\n5. Undermining the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883\n\nThe Pendleton Act established the principle of merit-based hiring and protection from political influence. Schedule F\u2019s reclassification could reintroduce a patronage system, allowing for the dismissal of employees based on political considerations, contrary to the Act\u2019s objectives.\n\n6. Erosion of Whistleblower Protections\n\nWhistleblower statutes protect federal employees who report misconduct. By removing civil service protections through Schedule F, employees may be deterred from reporting wrongdoing due to fear of retaliation, thereby weakening these legal safeguards.\n\n7. Application of the Major Questions Doctrine\n\nThe Major Questions Doctrine holds that significant policy changes require clear congressional authorization. Given the substantial impact of Schedule F on federal employment, its implementation without explicit legislative approval is considered unlawful under this doctrine.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed Schedule F classification poses several legal challenges by violating established federal laws and constitutional protections. Its implementation could fundamentally alter the structure and integrity of the federal civil service, leading to increased politicization and diminished employee rights.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "Reclassifying federal employees as civil servants may appear to be an administrative adjustment, but it carries significant consequences that could undermine the integrity and stability of the federal workforce. One major concern is that such reclassification could erode long-standing protections against political interference in government operations. The current merit-based system, which shields many federal employees from arbitrary dismissal, is designed to ensure that decisions are made in the public interest, not based on political loyalty or ideology. Stripping these protections risks politicizing essential functions of government, making it easier to remove career professionals for political reasons rather than performance-based ones. \n\nAnother consequence is the potential loss of institutional knowledge and expertise. Many federal employees build careers over decades, gaining specialized skills and deep familiarity with the programs they manage. Reclassification may lead to job insecurity and drive experienced workers to leave, either through early retirement or attrition. This brain drain could result in inefficiencies, increased reliance on costly contractors, and the weakening of agencies' abilities to carry out their missions effectively and impartially.\n\nMoreover, the reclassification could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing and internal dissent. When job security depends on political favor rather than neutral service, employees may be less likely to report misconduct or raise legitimate concerns. This undermines accountability, transparency, and good governance. In sum, reclassifying federal employees as civil servants in a way that reduces job protections or opens the door to political manipulation threatens the core values of an impartial and effective civil service, ultimately weakening democratic institutions and public trust in government.",

    "comment": "I firmly stand against the proposed implementation or reintroduction of 'Schedule F' for federal workers. This policy would undermine the century-old merit-based civil service system that ensures a professional, nonpartisan government workforce.\n\nThe establishment of Schedule F directly challenges the foundation laid by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was designed to eliminate patronage and create merit-based federal employment. By potentially allowing large numbers of career civil servants\u2014especially those in policy roles\u2014to be reclassified and removed without justification, Schedule F creates opportunities for politically-motivated personnel decisions. This contradicts the core principle of a politically-neutral civil service codified in federal law, which requires that employment decisions be based solely on qualifications and performance, free from political considerations.\n\nAdditionally, the broad and imprecise standards for Schedule F classification appear to conflict with the procedural protections guaranteed by law, which demand cause and due process for removing career federal employees. Removing these protections for thousands of public servants would not only reduce accountability but could also discourage honest expert advice and necessary dissent within agencies\u2014ultimately hampering government effectiveness.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management has a statutory obligation to uphold merit system principles. Adopting Schedule F would run counter to this legal mandate and would subject career professionals to inappropriate political influence, jeopardizing the stability and integrity of federal programs across changing administrations.\n\nIn summary, the Schedule F proposal represents a serious challenge to fundamental principles of effective governance, civil service independence, and legal protections. I strongly encourage the administration and OPM to abandon any regulatory framework aimed at implementing or reviving this concerning classification.",

    "comment": "\nI strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the proposed rule establishing Schedule Policy/Career positions in the excepted service. This rule fundamentally undermines the constitutional and statutory framework of the merit-based civil service, exposes career employees to politically motivated removal, and mischaracterizes the nature of \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d roles.\n\nThe proposal conflates policy implementation with policy formulation, inappropriately expanding the definition of \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d roles to include positions\u2014like public affairs, communications, and technical operations\u2014that have no discretion to determine or direct policy. The legislative and judicial history surrounding 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(b)(2) and the Roth v. Brownell (1954) decision make clear that mere involvement in executing policy does not strip an employee of appeal rights. The proposed rule fails to distinguish between career technical experts who advise on implementation and political appointees who craft policy.\n\nPreference-eligible veterans are entitled to procedural protections and appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7511 and 7701. The rule offers no justification for how OPM will reconcile these protections with the stated intent to eliminate due process and MSPB review. These longstanding statutory rights are not waivable by administrative reclassification and cannot be set aside without congressional action.\n\nThe proposal repeatedly cites anecdotal or outdated survey data to claim that agencies cannot remove poor performers. Data cited from the 2016 MSPB Merit Principles Survey and 2020 FEVS is outdated and fails to account for recent reforms, including streamlined procedures and increased agency training on poor performance management. The rule fails to acknowledge that probationary employees and temporary appointments already allow for removal without appeal, making this sweeping change to tenured positions unnecessary.\n\nRemoving appeal rights for a broad category of career employees contradicts the statutory requirement that \u201cemployees should be protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8)). Creating a class of at-will career employees opens the door to patronage removals and chills dissent, whistleblowing, and honest execution of federal duties.\n\nThe proposed rule raises significant constitutional concerns under the First and Fifth Amendments. Employees may be removed for perceived lack of enthusiasm in supporting policy, even if they are lawfully carrying out duties, chilling free speech and honest public service. Stripping MSPB appeal rights from career civil servants without individualized review deprives them of property interests in continued employment without due process, violating Arnett v. Kennedy (1974).\n\nRather than dismantling procedural protections, OPM should focus on supervisor training for performance management; refine existing Chapter 43 procedures to allow faster action on clear misconduct or incompetence; and provide oversight to ensure agencies apply adverse actions fairly without politicization.\n\nThis proposed rule represents a dramatic and unjustified shift in federal personnel policy. It is built on flawed premises, disregards statutory and constitutional safeguards, and invites political abuse in the federal workplace. I urge OPM to withdraw the proposal in its entirety and instead work with Congress to enact balanced, legally sound reforms.",

As a federal employee serving in a technical management position, I write to express grave concern regarding the scope, legal implications, and structural consequences of this rule.\nAlthough my position involves managerial functions within engineering and technical program support\u2014such as configuration management, systems integration, and contract monitoring\u2014it does not entail the development, formulation, or advocacy of policy. Nor does it involve confidential deliberations with political leadership, the exercise of high-level discretionary authority, or the supervision of attorneys or personnel in roles customarily understood to be policy-making.\nNevertheless, the proposed regulation\u2019s broad and ambiguous language raises the alarming possibility that positions such as mine could be reclassified under the newly defined \u201cSchedule Policy/Career.\u201d Such reclassification would eliminate longstanding statutory civil service protections, including critical due process rights under Title 5 of the U.S. Code, thereby undermining the merit-based foundation of the federal workforce.\nThis rule effectively resurrects the legal and constitutional defects of the former \u201cSchedule F\u201d initiative, which was widely criticized by legal scholars, good government organizations, and former bipartisan federal officials. At its core, the rule threatens to erode the structural independence of the civil service by allowing for the politicization of roles that have traditionally and appropriately been nonpartisan in character.\nThe Constitution mandates a federal workforce that is accountable to the law and the public, not to the shifting political preferences of a particular administration. The merit system principles enshrined in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 are designed precisely to protect this independence\u2014ensuring that decisions regarding hiring, discipline, and removal are based on objective qualifications and job performance, not political affiliation or perceived loyalty.\nIf enacted in its current form, the rule will not strengthen accountability. It will weaken it\u2014by exposing technical and scientific professionals to arbitrary dismissal and discouraging talented individuals from entering or remaining in federal service. Moreover, it invites significant litigation risks, both constitutional and administrative, as it creates a subclass of federal employees stripped of procedural protections without clear statutory justification.\nFor these reasons, I strongly urge OPM to withdraw or substantially revise the proposed rule to narrowly define and limit the positions eligible for reclassification. Any such redefinition must be consistent with constitutional safeguards, established civil service law, and the imperative of maintaining a politically neutral and technically proficient federal workforce.\nThank you for the opportunity to submit this comment.\n",

Generally, tenure protections for public employees create an expectation of continued employment that counts as \u201cproperty\u201d for due process purposes. The CSRA\u2019s removal restrictions have been held to create this kind of constitutional property interest(see Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 1985 and Stone v.

Those are the employees principally responsible for determining, making, and advocating federal policy. In this context, the term \u201cconfidential\u201d is best read to describe employees with close working relationships to senior principals. Other federal statutes, in fact, draw an explicit equivalence between these terms and political appointees.

I understand that's the entire point, that this administration wants to consolidate power, ignore the law, and make themselves impossible to be slowed or stopped as they hoard wealth to themselves and their donors while trampling the hard fought rights of everyone else.\nThis isn't right, and you know it isn't right.

INTRODUCTION\nDonald Trump and his allies\u2019 promises to gut the federal civil service have received\nsignificant attention. They have said they will purge the executive branch of staff who are\ninsufficiently loyal to the President and his political cause. In doing so, they will seek to\nreturn our government to a patronage system under which political allegiance, not merit,\nmatters most for federal employment. They have proposed numerous means of\naccomplishing this goal, including reducing the size of the federal workforce, relocating\nagencyoffices,andevenabolishingagenciesentirely.1\nOne policy likely tofigureprominentlyinthenewadministration\u2019seffortsiscalled\u201cSchedule\nF.\u201d Schedule F, first floated in 2020, would purport to strip vast swaths of the federal\nworkforce of procedural job protections and make them fireable at will. The Trump\ncampaign promised that \u201c[o]n Day One,\u201d Trump would \u201cre-issue\u201d an \u201cexecutive order\nrestoringthepresident\u2019sauthoritytofireroguebureaucrats.\u201d2\nThe threat ofScheduleFis,bynow,wellknown.Lessattentionhasbeenpaid,however,toits\nlegal vulnerability. Schedule F is very likely unlawful, both under Congress\u2019s civil service\nlaws and the Constitution. Federal law affords the vast majority of federal workers\nprotections against arbitrary or politically motivated firing. An exceptiontothatruleapplies\nto senior political officials, who naturally turn over at the start of a new administration.\nDonald Trump will seek to use that narrow exception to fire at willthousandsofcareercivil\nservants. That dramatic and unprecedented policy, which would overturn the protections\nCongress established for federal employees, is unlawful. At any rate, even if the President\ncould remove broad swathes of the federal workforce from the civil service on paper,\nbedrock principles of due process\u2014embedded both in the civil service laws and the\nConstitution itself\u2014would bar the government from stripping federal employees of the job\nprotectionstheyhavepreviouslyaccrued.\nIt is essential that civil servants\u2014as well as advocates, commentators, and the\npublic\u2014understand that Schedule F\u2019s vulnerability means its implementation is not a sure\nthing.\nThisIssueBriefexplainswhyScheduleFisunlawful.\n1 See, e.g., Steven Greenhouse, Project 2025\u2019s Plan to Gut Civil Service withMassFirings:\u201cIt\u2019sLiketheBadOldDays\nof King Henry VIII,\u201d The Guardian (Sept. 25, 2024); Eric Katz, Trump\u2019s \u201cDOGE\u201d Commission Promises Mass Federal\nLayoffs,EndingTelework,Gov\u2019tExec.(Nov.18,2024).\n2 Agenda47: President Trump\u2019s Plan to Dismantle the Deep State andReturnPowertotheAmericanPeople(Mar.\n21,2023).\nMemorandum|2\nIssueBrief governingforimpact.org\nII. BACKGROUND\nFor much of the nineteenth century, the so-called \u201cspoils system\u201d governed federal\nemployment. Federal employees were hired and fired based on their political affiliation\nrather than their competence. It was a patronage system rife with corruption. Congress\neventually stepped in, enacting a series of lawsoverthelastcenturyandahalfestablishing\na merit-based system of federal employment. OneofthemostimportantoftheseistheCivil\nServiceReformActof1978(\u201cCSRA\u201d).3\nThe CSRA establishes a set of\u201cmeritsystemprinciples\u201dforthefederalworkforce,including\nthat \u201cselection and advancement should bedeterminedsolelyonthebasisofrelativeability,\nknowledge, and skills,\u201d and that federal employees \u201cshould receive fair and equitable\ntreatment in all aspectsofpersonnelmanagementwithoutregardtopoliticalaffiliation\u201dand\nbe \u201cprotected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political\npurposes.\u201d4\nAs part of safeguarding federal employees from undue partisan influence, the CSRA\nprovides thatanagencymayonlyfire,demote,orissuealengthysuspensiontoanemployee\n\u201cfor cause,\u201d not for arbitrary or improper reasons.5 And it must first provide notice of its\nreasons and an opportunity for the employee to respond.6 The employee may then appeal\nthe action to a neutral federaladjudicator,theMeritSystemsProtectionBoard.7IftheBoard\nrulesagainsther,shemaygotofederalcourt.8\nNot every employee gets these procedural protections. As relevant here, the CSRA carves\nout employees \u201cwhose position[s] ha[ve] been determined to be of a confidential,\npolicy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\u201d9 This group, which we\u2019ll\nrefer to as \u201cconfidential and policymaking\u201d employees, may be fired at will\u2014that is,forany\nreasonornoreasonatall.\nThe confidential and policymaking designation has historicallyappliedonlytoasmallgroup\nof employees: political appointees.10 Political appointees are those inhigh-levelgovernment\npositions who have no expectation of continued employment after the end of the\n3 For anoverviewofthishistory,seeUpholdingCivilServiceProtectionsandMeritSystemPrinciples,89Fed.Reg.\n24,982,24,984\u201386(Apr.9,2024).\n45U.S.C.\u00a72301(b).\n55U.S.C.\u00a77513(a).\n65U.S.C.\u00a77513(b),(c).\n75U.S.C.\u00a77513(d).\n85U.S.C.\u00a77703(a)(1),(b)(1)(A);28U.S.C.\u00a71295(a)(9).\n95U.S.C.\u00a77511(b)(2).\n10SeeUpholdingCivilServiceProtections,89Fed.Reg.at25,019\u201323.\nMemorandum|3\nIssueBrief governingforimpact.org\npresidential administration in which they were hired. That distinguishes them from career\nemployees, whose tenures generally continue across administrations. Confidential and\npolicymaking positions held by political appointees are documented on a list known as\nScheduleC.11\nSchedule F was designed to dramatically reduce the scope of the CSRA\u2019s protections. In\n2020, President Trump directed agencies to identify career employees who \u201cdischarge\nsignificant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating and implementing\nexecutive branch policy and programs\u201d as confidential and policymaking employees and\nplace them on a new list\u2014Schedule F.12 Thegoalofthepolicywastostriptheseemployees\noftheirCSRAtenureprotectionsandmakethemfireableatwill.\nThe incoming Biden Administration rescinded Schedule F before agencies could implement\nit, so its full scope never became clear. But Trump loyalists have suggested that it was\ndesigned to allow the Trump Administration to fire at will tens of thousands of employees\nwith substantive responsibilities.13 That would eviscerate the federal civil service\u2019s merit\nsystemprinciplesandreturnlargepartsofthefederalworkforcetothespoilssystem.\nThe Biden Administration, in addition to rescinding the Schedule F executive order, took\nadditionalactiontoavoidthisresult.In2024,theOfficeofPersonnelManagementenacteda\nrule providing that employees cannot be involuntarily stripped of their tenure protections,\nofficially interpreting the confidential and policymaking designation to refer to political\nappointees only, and instituting certain procedures agencies must follow to reclassify\nemployees.14\nEven so, the second Trump Administration is certain to move quickly in restoring Schedule\nF.15 While we do not yet know the precise form the policy will take, we expect that, as in\n2020, it will move to strip CSRA protections from numerous career employees on the\ngroundsthattheyoccupyconfidentialorpolicymakingpositions.\n11 See Off. of Pers.

SCHEDULE F IS UNLAWFUL\nScheduleFviolatestheCSRAandtheConstitution.\nThe CSRA bars expanding the confidential and policymaking designation beyond political\nappointees. The CSRA does not extendremovalprotectionsto\u201canemployeewhoseposition\nhas been determined\u201d by the President \u201cto be of a confidential, policy-determining,\npolicy-making, or policy-advocating character.\u201d16 But that phrase does not authorize the\nPresident to rove the executive branch for any employee who does substantive work.\nInstead, it has a specific meaning, established by the text and confirmed by years of\nunbroken practice: political appointees. Any effort to expand the reach of the exception\nbeyondthatsettledmeaningwouldbecontrarytolaw.\nThe terms \u201cconfidential,\u201d \u201cpolicy-determining,\u201d \u201cpolicy-making,\u201d and \u201cpolicy-advocating\u201d on\ntheir face refer to the sorts of high-ranking positions held by an administration\u2019s political\nappointees. Those are the employees principally responsible for determining, making, and\nadvocating federal policy. And, in this context, the term \u201cconfidential\u201d is best read to\ndescribe employees with close working relationships to senior principals. Especially when\ntaken together, these words connote leadership. Other federal statutes, in fact, draw an\nexplicit equivalence between confidential, policy-determining, policy-making,\npolicy-advocating positions and politicalappointeestatus.Forinstance,Section349(d)(3)(B)\nof Title 6, which establishesanofficewithintheDepartmentofHomelandSecurity,provides\nthat \u201cthe term \u2018political appointee\u2019 means any employee who occupies a position which has\nbeen excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential,\npolicy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\u201d17 Thereareseveralother\nstatutesthatmakethissameequivalence.18\nExtensive past practice confirms that the confidential and policymaking designation\ndescribes political appointees.

But all employment\nactivities below these levels . . . should be carried on within the framework of the\ndecentralized civil service system.\u201d25 Later, during the Eisenhower Administration, a second\nHoover Commission emphasized the point, noting that \u201cthe term \u2018policy-determining\u2019 was\nusedtodescribepositionswhichshouldproperlybereservedforpoliticalexecutives.\u201d26\nWhenPresidentEisenhowertookoffice,hisadministrationstatedthatthe\u201ctypesofpositions\nthatdonotbelongintheCivilServiceSystem\u201dwere\u201c[t]hosepositionswheretheincumbents\nshould receive, in the interests of sound administration, a delegation of authority from the\n19 See generally Comment of Protect Democracy and Walter M.

During the\nKennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter Administrations\u2014that is, during the decades\nleading up to the CSRA\u2019s 1978 enactment\u2014the number of confidential and\npolicy-determining positions in the executive branch never exceeded 1,590.29 And for its\npart,theMeritSystemsProtectionBoard\u2014chargedbyCongresstoadjudicatethelegalityof\nfederal personnel actions\u2014has long held \u201cthat the terms \u2018confidential, policy-determining,\npolicy-making, and policy-advocating\u2019 are a shorthand way of describing positions to be\nfilledby\u2018politicalappointees.\u2019\u201d30\nThe \u201cbest reading\u201d of the CSRA is that the confidential and policymaking designation only\napplies to political appointees, but the Supreme Court has made clear that \u201cExecutive\nBranch interpretation[s]\u201d like these\u2014which prevailed \u201ccontemporaneously with enactment\nof the statute and remained consistent over time\u201d\u2014are \u201centitled to very great respect\u201d as\nwell.31\nIndeed, Congress enacted the CSRA against this legal backdrop.

Schedule F, which disregards that\nwell-establishedlimitation,isunlawful.\nOne way to think about Schedule F\u2019s illegality is through the lens of the major questions\ndoctrine. The doctrine, which the federal courts have wielded with increased force and\nfrequency in recent years, calls for skepticismwhentheexecutivebranchpurportstonewly\nlocate a sweeping, consequential authority in a longstanding statute. The doctrine is based\non the inference that Congress does not hide \u201celephants\u201d (vast new authority) in\n\u201cmouseholes\u201d(\u201clittle-used\u201dor\u201cancillary\u201dstatutes).35\nThis mode of reasoning confirms that Schedule F exceeds the President\u2019s statutory\nauthority.36 For the first time, a President would claim to find in the modest power to\ndesignate confidential and policymaking positions\u2014which has only ever been applied to\npolitical appointees\u2014the authority to remove civil service protections from many career\nfederal employees with substantive responsibilities. That would topple the CSRA\u2019s merit\nsystem principles and unilaterally return the United States to the spoils system of federal\nemployment. President Trump would use a narrow carveout from the CSRA to, in effect,\nrepeal a great deal the Act itself\u2014to \u201ceffectuate[] a fundamental revision of the statute.\u201d37\nThat is exactly the sort of elephants-in-mouseholes mismatch the major question doctrine\naddresses.\n34UpholdingCivilServiceProtections,89Fed.Reg.at25,020.\n35WestVirginiav.EPA,597U.S.697,746\u201347(2022)(Gorsuch,J.,concurring);id.at724,730(maj.op.).\n36 The major questions doctrineverylikelyappliestopresidentialaction.SeeLouisianav.Biden,55F.4th1017,1029\n(5th Cir. 2022); Kentucky v.

One of those employees was then fired without noticeorreasons.InRothv.Brownell,\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that notwithstanding the government\u2019s\nreclassification of the employee, he was entitled to the civil service law\u2019s protections.\n\u201cNeither the formula of \u2018excepting\u2019 the kind of position a person holds, nor any other\nformula, can obviate the requirements of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act that [n]o person in the\nclassified civil service of the United States shall be removed therefrom without notice and\nreasonsgiveninwriting.\u201d43\nRoth\u2019s logic extends to Schedule F. The CSRA provides that an employee may only be\nterminated for cause, after notice and an opportunity to be heard. Firing an employee\nwithout notice or reasons violates that requirement. And it makes no difference that\nSchedule F will purport toremovetheseprotectionsbeforeanyparticularfiringtakesplace.\nRoth rejected the argument that Roth was not \u201cremoved\u201d from the civil service within the\nmeaning of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act because the Eisenhower Administration hadpreviously\nmoved his position to a civil service category outside of the Act\u2019s protections.44 \u201cThis is a\nparadox. Roth was once in the classified civil service, did not leave it voluntarily, andisnow\noutofit.Itfollowsthathewasremovedfromit.\u201d45\nFollowing Roth, the executive branch developed a consistent position\u2014matinained for\nnearly 70 years\u2014that a civil servant retains tenure protections even after her position is\nreclassified into an unprotected civil service category.46 As a representative example, the\nReagan Administration\u2019s Office of Personnel Management explained that, under the CSRA,\nwhile political appointees in confidential and policymaking positions generally \u201cmay be\nseparated at any time,\u201d there is an exception for \u201cthose who were serving in a\n[tenure-protected] position . . . when OPM authorized its conversion to Schedule C and who\n43Rothv.Brownell,215F.2d500,502(D.C.Cir.1954)(ellipsisandsomeinternalquotationmarksomitted).\n44Id.at502.\n45Id.at502.\n46 See, e.g., Amending the Civil Service Rules and Authorizing a New Appointment System for the Competitive\nService, Exec.

Violation of Civil Service Protections (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 & \u00a7 7513)\n\nThis rule appears to undermine the merit system principles established in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301, which require fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of federal employment.\n\nThe proposed expansion of managerial authority and reduction of appeal mechanisms directly conflicts with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which guarantees employees the right to:\n\nAdvance written notice of adverse action\n\nA reasonable time to respond\n\nRepresentation\n\nA written decision\n\nAnd access to Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) review\n\n\nReducing or eliminating these due process steps would place the U.S. government in violation of its own statutory employment framework.\n\n2. Potential Violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8))\n\nThe rule, by weakening appeal rights and extending discretionary authority to supervisors, could facilitate retaliatory terminations\u2014especially against whistleblowers. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), it is illegal to take or threaten personnel action against employees who disclose wrongdoing.\n\nA structure that enables swift removal without sufficient review increases the risk of unlawful reprisal.\n\n3. Similarities to \u201cSchedule F\u201d and Potential Constitutional Violations\n\nThis rule is similar to Executive Order 13957 (\u201cSchedule F\u201d), which was rescinded due to widespread concern over undermining the nonpartisan nature of the civil service.\n\nLegal scholars and watchdogs warned that policies like Schedule F could violate:\n\nFirst Amendment protections (via political firings)\n\nFifth Amendment due process rights, especially when removals are arbitrary and lack proper procedural safeguards (source).\n\nThis proposal follows a similar trajectory, especially in how it removes neutral review by the MSPB and centralizes employment power in executive agencies.\n\nFederal employment should be grounded in merit, fairness, and transparency\u2014not convenience or political loyalty. This proposed rule risks eroding constitutional and statutory protections under the guise of reform. It also lowers the quality standards of our vitally important federal employees.

This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.\"",

    "comment": "As a citizen of the United States, I have serious concerns about both the legality and the political wisdom of this proposed rule. As it presently stands, I must strongly oppose its adoption. \n\nLegally speaking, the long and short of it is that the rule directly contravenes the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA). The CSRA lays out, in Schedule C, the list of federal employees who are exempt from standard civil protections; the list does not include career employees. For the executive branch to assert a unilateral privilege to reclassify employees, and strip them of those protections, constitutes a direct abrogation of standing law and a violation of the separation of powers. If there is a problem with the CSRA, requiring amendment or alteration, it is solely the province of Congress to address it. \n\nIn fact, however, there is not a problem with the CSRA. The plain fact of the matter is that career civil service protections exist primarily to prevent partisan politics from overwhelming the work of the federal government, and that they do so effectively. Rogue partisan civil servants, acting on their own initiative to thwart the lawful directives of those above them in the federal hierarchy, are - rare to the point of being fantastical. Partisan politicians eager to subvert the nonpartisan work of the agencies, however, are not rare at all. The introduction of Schedule Policy/Career would leave thousands of federal officials with the choice between being terminated and letting themselves be used as political pawns. There is every reason to believe that, given full control over the livelihoods of civil servants, many politicians would cheerfully use the agencies to punish their political opponents, grant favors to political allies, and cover up inconvenient truths. These are precisely the outcomes that the CSRA's protections are designed to prevent.\n\nLeaving all legalities aside, just as a matter of wise policy - to overcome that consideration should require more than vague hand-waving about hypothetical \"poor performers\" and the invocation of vague survey results. It should, for example, require some actual evidence that there is an actual systematic problem with civil servant performance or partisan malfeasance. But of course there is no such evidence, because no such problem exists. \n\nOn a side note, citing Schedule F as being causally connected to rising federal employee morale is tendentious to the point of being actively insulting. If Federal employee job satisfaction rose during the first Trump administration, the late-appearing and never-actually-implemented Schedule F seems like a vanishingly unlikely reason for it. (A far likelier reason would be the widespread adoption of remote work policies.)",

This rule is a thinly veiled attempt to further politicize the federal workforce, consolidating unprecedented power in the hands of the Executive Branch and jeopardizing the independence, integrity, and functionality of essential government agencies.\n\nThe creation of Schedule Policy/Career is particularly concerning, as it is a direct challenge to the longstanding principle that civil servants should operate above the political fray, ensuring continuity and stability regardless of which party controls the White House. The reclassification of these positions as \"excepted from the competitive service\" under Schedule Policy/Career further blurs the line between career civil servants and political appointees. These positions\u2014critical to the effective functioning of government\u2014should not be subjected to the whims of a particular administration.\n\nAllowing these positions to be more easily appointed, removed, and subject to political control only serves to undermine the very foundation of our civil service. Federal employees working in positions of \"confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\" character should not be subjected to partisan influence. It is crucial that these employees are allowed to carry out their duties without the threat of dismissal based on political allegiance. The proposed rule will foster an environment where loyalty to the President becomes the determining factor in job security, rather than professional qualifications, expertise, and dedication to public service.\n\nThe OPM's insistence that these positions \u201care required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability\u201d further entrenches the politicization of the workforce. By introducing the possibility of dismissal for failing to demonstrate personal or political support for the current administration, this rule sets a dangerous precedent. It disregards the Constitutionally-mandated principle of government employees' independence, turning them into mere extensions of political power rather than trusted civil servants working in the public interest.\n\nMoreover, the potential for Schedule Policy/Career to further divide the civil service into two classes\u2014those who serve at the pleasure of the President and those who do not\u2014will create a deeply politicized government.

    "comment": "I submit this comment to express concern over the insufficient and selectively interpreted data cited in support of OPM\u2019s proposed rule to establish \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d within the excepted service. The rule relies heavily on survey responses and anecdotal reports to justify sweeping changes to the federal civil service, including the elimination of procedural rights for a broad class of career employees. These data sources do not meet the evidentiary standard required to support such significant regulatory action.\n\n1. Overreliance on Subjective Survey Data\nThe proposed rule repeatedly cites results from the Merit Systems Protection Board\u2019s (MSPB) Merit Principles Survey and the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) to claim that agencies struggle to remove poor performers. For example, the rule notes that only 41 percent of supervisors report confidence in removing an employee for serious misconduct, and that only 26 percent feel confident removing an employee for poor performance.\n\nHowever, these responses are subjective perceptions, not objective performance metrics. Supervisors\u2019 confidence levels may reflect:\n\nLack of training or familiarity with the existing process;\nMisconceptions about procedural requirements;\nInstitutional hesitance to pursue removals, regardless of legal viability.\nThese perceptions cannot justify removing legally mandated protections for all employees in \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d roles. Perceived difficulty is not evidence of systemic failure. Regulatory change should be based on demonstrable outcomes, not impressions.\n\n2. Inadequate Context for Removal Statistics\nThe rule acknowledges that approximately 10,000 federal employees are removed each year for performance or conduct but dismisses this figure by stating that many of these separations involve temporary or probationary employees. This framing minimizes the fact that thousands of full-time, tenured employees are also successfully removed each year under current chapters 43 and 75 procedures.\n\nMoreover, the rule fails to provide:\n\nA breakdown of removals by tenure, cause, or agency;\nData on the frequency of successful appeals to the MSPB;\nEvidence that removal rates are insufficient compared to legitimate misconduct rates.\nWithout this context, the claim that the current system is ineffective is speculative and unsupported by the actual data.\n\n3. Dismissal of Contradictory Evidence\nThe April 2024 final rule, which the proposed rule seeks to overturn, found that the FEVS and other data sources did not demonstrate widespread failure in the current performance system. The proposed rule dismisses these earlier conclusions without providing new empirical evidence. Instead, it selectively cites the same data while applying a different interpretation.\n\nFor instance, the proposed rule suggests that widespread dissatisfaction among federal employees with their agencies\u2019 handling of poor performers confirms a failure of the current system. But dissatisfaction could also stem from poor supervision, cultural issues, or resource constraints\u2014not from flaws in the legal process.\n\nCherry-picking or reinterpreting previously analyzed survey data without new methodology, documentation, or statistical rigor fails to meet the standard of evidence required for reversing a final agency rule.\n\n4. Lack of Empirical Support for the \u201cPolicy-Influencing\u201d Category\nNowhere in the rule is there rigorous, data-driven analysis explaining:\n\nHow many positions would fall under the proposed definition of \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d;\nWhether employees in these positions have been disproportionately involved in misconduct or performance issues;\nWhy procedural protections specific to these roles are unjustified.\nWithout such analysis, the decision to single out \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d employees for removal from chapters 43 and 75 protections appears arbitrary and unsupported by evidence.\n\nConclusion\nThe proposed rule attempts to justify a sweeping transformation of the civil service using limited, anecdotal, and perception-based evidence.

    "comment": "See attached file(s)\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\nComment on Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the\nCivil Service\nDocket Number: OPM-2025-0004\nThis comment is submitted in response to OPM\u2019s proposed rule, which asserts the goal\nof improving performance, accountability, and responsiveness within the federal civil\nservice. The proposed changes claim to update and reinforce civil service practices, yet\nthey risk destabilizing a system that has long relied on clear, merit-based protections. In\naddressing concerns over underperformance and the handling of problematic\nemployees, the proposal institutes a broad overhaul rather than implementing focused,\ntargeted reforms. A more specific set of reforms would promote accountability and\nresponsiveness while preserving the essential stability of the nonpartisan, merit-based\nworkforce.\nNeglected Reliance Interests and Stakeholder Implications\nFederal employees and the American public have long depended on a stable, merit-\nbased civil service system. This rule disregards these critical interests by dismantling due\nprocess protections from politicized job actions\u2014the very cornerstones of federal\nemployment. It sends a clear message: that career civil servants are undervalued and\nexpendable.\nThis concern is compounded by alarming rhetoric; for example, President Trump\nrecently stated on Truth Social\u2014reported by Axios\u2014that \u201cif these government workers\nrefuse to advance the policy interests of the President, or are engaging in corrupt\nbehavior, they should no longer have a job. This is common sense, and will allow the\nfederal government to finally be \u2018run like a business.\u2019\u201d Coupled with mass layoffs and\nreclassifications, such messaging has sown tremendous and persistent distrust and\nuncertainty within the workforce.\nThe resulting instability not only demoralizes current employees but also erodes the\ncapacity of federal agencies to carry out essential and effective services. By undermining\nthe very framework that has long ensured a professional and nonpartisan civil service,\nthe rule alienates key stakeholders who depend on the continuity and integrity of\ngovernment operations. It is a direct affront to the principles of fairness and reliability\nthat underpin public trust in federal institutions.\n1\nAmbiguities in Defining Policy-Influencing Roles\nThe proposed rule employs vague, overly broad, poorly-defined terms like \u201cpolicy-\nmaking,\u201d \u201cpolicy-determining,\u201d and \u201cpolicy-advocating\u201d to classify positions subject to\nrevised civil service protections. Such imprecise language risks arbitrary reclassification\nand punitive actions. Recent reports suggest that the Administration has instructed\nagencies to begin reclassifying tens of thousands of federal employees under such\npretexts, stripping them of job protections. The absence of narrowly tailored and clearly\ndefined criteria for identifying \u201cpolicy influencing\u201d positions invites inconsistent\napplications across agencies and administrations, thereby raising the specter of\npolitically motivated decisions that undermine the nonpartisan protections essential to\nour merit-based system.\nStatutory Authority and Separation of Powers\nWhile the Office of Personnel Management derives its authority from the Civil Service\nReform Act and the Administrative Procedure Act, the rule\u2019s application of that\nauthority is alarming and inconsistent with longstanding statutory principles. Rather\nthan a measured, evidence-based approach, OPM is transforming career positions into\nat-will roles for policy-influencing employees en masse\u2014a marked departure from the\nprotections Congress enshrined. Recent litigation further underscores this ultra vires\naction, with unions arguing that nullifying established protections without proper\nnotice violates statutory limits and subverts Congress\u2019s intent.\nThis overreach not only exceeds the statutory authority, but also serves as a desperate,\ngrasping attempt to unconstitutionally concentrate power within the executive branch,\nbypassing the essential checks and balances that underpin our constitutional system.\nThis is something our nation\u2019s founders specifically warned about, and designed the\nConstitution to try to prevent.\nRecent news reports document concerns raised by experts and policymakers alike,\nwarning that such expansive reinterpretation essentially grants political appointees\nunfettered authority to remove employees on a whim, eroding decades-old safeguards.\nThis shift is a dangerous encroachment upon the separation of powers, one that\njeopardizes the impartiality and durability of the merit-based civil service.\nStatutory and Constitutional Authority Concerns\nThe proposed rule attempts to justify stripping essential job protections by invoking\nSection 3302 of the Civil Service Reform Act and related statutory provisions.\n2\nHowever, this interpretation stretches the language far beyond its intended purpose and\ncompletely disregards the constitutional safeguards integral to our federal employment\nsystem. By effectively authorizing discretionary, unchecked executive control over\npersonnel decisions, the rule bypasses the due process and judicial review for career\nemployees. Many commentators see this expansive reading as a gross overreach\u2014a\ndeliberate circumvention of Congress\u2019s intent to balance efficiency with fairness.\nOverreliance on Presidential Discretion and Erosion of Checks and Balances\nThe rule\u2019s concentration of power in the executive branch is most alarming. By\nconverting policy influencing positions into at-will roles and dismantling established\nadverse action procedures, it grants unfettered discretion to the President and his\nappointees\u2014leaving little room for judicial or legislative oversight. This centralization\ntransforms the merit-based system into a politically volatile instrument. In practice, such\nan erosion of institutional checks and balances not only compromises the longstanding\nimpartiality of federal service but also invites arbitrary, partisan actions that threaten\nthe integrity of our democratic institutions. The stakes are too high for a system that\nshould protect career civil servants from transient political impulses. The statutory and\nconstitutional overreaches raise profound questions about executive power, but they\nalso translate directly into challenges for daily operations and internal workforce\nstability.\nBalancing Merit System Principles with Accountability\nFederal agencies are said to face challenges managing underperformance and addressing\nmisconduct\u2014issues raised in Federal Employee Viewpoint Surveys. The current system\ncan sometimes shift poor performers rather than remedying shortcomings with timely,\ntargeted performance improvement plans.\nThe proposed rule seeks to enhance accountability by reclassifying policy influencing\npositions to allow for swift removal from critical roles. However, this approach risks\nundermining the essential balance between ensuring rapid corrective measures and\nmaintaining robust procedural safeguards. Rapid removals may sometimes be necessary,\nyet, if pursued in a manner that diminishes objective, performance-based evaluations,\nthey can incentivize arbitrary decisions and invite political manipulation into a system\nthat must remain insulated from transient partisanship.\nA wiser, more measured approach would involve targeted reforms to streamline and\nenforce existing performance improvement procedures without a wholesale alteration\nof civil service protections. Strengthening mechanisms such as clearly defined\n3\nperformance improvement plans and enhanced supervisory training can improve\naccountability without eroding the stability and fairness integral to the federal\nworkforce.\nRecommendations for a Balanced, Enduring Reform\nGiven the significant concerns raised by the proposed rule, a more measured, targeted\napproach is required. Rather than embracing a one-size-fits-all radical overhaul, OPM\nmust return to a framework that emphasizes sound performance management while\nsafeguarding due process.\nOPM should engage directly with congressional oversight bodies and labor\nrepresentatives in a genuine, transparent dialogue\u2014one that prioritizes the long-term\nstability and nonpartisan integrity of our civil service. Concrete measures should\ninclude enhanced supervisory training and robust performance improvement plans.\nMoreover, OPM must ensure that any future revisions adhere rigorously to the notice-\nand-comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act\u2014an obvious\nimperative underscored by recent litigation\u2014to safeguard the legitimacy and longevity of\nthe merit-based system.\nQuestionable Economic and Operational Assumptions\nThe rule is premised on the notion that stripping certain protections will yield modest\ncost savings, streamlined separations, and reduced litigation\u2014thus promising enhanced\nagency performance. However, these assumptions are flawed. Increased turnover, the\nloss of institutional knowledge, and a surge in litigation can rapidly outweigh any short-\nterm efficiencies gained from shifting to at-will employment. Rather than delivering\ngenuine operational improvements, the rule risks creating a fa\u00e7ade of fiscal prudence\nwhile sowing the seeds for long-term dysfunction. The hidden costs\u2014including\ndiminished employee morale, reduced agency effectiveness, and the destabilization of\nkey government functions\u2014are likely to impose a far heavier burden on federal\noperations.\nChallenges to Future Recruitment and Perceptions of Federal Service\nThe rule sends a negative message to all prospective federal employees, especially recent\ngraduates. Disparaging rhetoric from both the Administration and Congress, alongside\npolicies that imply federal workers are expendable, may deter talented and committed\nindividuals from considering federal service. The proposed rule, along with the\nmessaging, implicitly suggests that federal workers are no longer valued\u2014that the system\n4\nhas shifted from one of professional respect to one of disregard, as though \u201cwe don\u2019t\nwant you.\u201d This message risks more than just tarnishing morale; it will shrink the pool\nof talented, committed individuals willing to serve the public, thereby imperiling the\nlong-term efficacy and neutrality of our federal workforce. Any reform efforts should\nnot only address performance challenges but also actively reinforce the message that\nfederal service remains a stable, worthy, and respected career path.\nConclusion\nIn short, the proposed rule represents a sweeping departure from the core principles of\nmerit-based employment and due process that have long underpinned federal service.\nIts broad, imprecise definitions and politically charged revisions risk transforming the\nfederal workforce into an instrument of arbitrary, partisan manipulation, rather than\ngenuine accountability. Reforms should uphold fairness, predictability, and\nnonpartisan integrity, rather than enabling arbitrary removals and destabilizing internal\nstructures.\nThank you for considering my comments.\nMichael Ravnitzky\nSilver Spring, Maryland\n5\n\n\n",

    "comment": "I'm writing to vehemently oppose the return to the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for non-political federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned the nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century and threatens to reclassify many positions that should not be held by political appointees.\n\nLooking to our present laws, the proposed Schedule F directly would undermine the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8) and violates the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nThis proposal is completely counter to the regulations cited above, good governance and civil service independence.

    "comment": "The proposed rule \u201cImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\u201d represents a paradigm shift in federal personnel policy \u2013 one that, despite its optimistic title, would likely degrade performance, undermine true accountability, and reduce responsiveness to the public by subordinating career employees to partisan control. The danger of eroding the separation between politics and administration cannot be overstated. It risks transforming a merit-based civil service into a patronage workforce where expertise is subordinated to loyalty tests. History has shown the damage a politicized bureaucracy can do \u2013 from the rampant corruption and incompetence of the 19th-century spoils era \ufffc \ufffc, to the constitutional violations that occur when officials use public offices as political weapons \ufffc \ufffc. It is for good reason that reformers built a system to prevent those abuses. A nonpartisan civil service is not a partisan issue; it is a fundamental institutional safeguard that benefits any administration that governs in good faith and every citizen who relies on unbiased governance.\n\nUltimately, the goals of performance, accountability, and responsiveness in government are best served by empowering professional civil servants to do their jobs free of improper political interference, not by rendering them servile to political appointees. An effective civil service is one where employees can be held to high standards \u2013 indeed, the merit system demands high performance and ethical conduct \u2013 but also one where employees can challenge unlawful or unwise directives without fear of baseless removal. True accountability in the civil service means accountability to the laws and the American people, not just to the momentary occupants of high office. And responsiveness should be toward the public\u2019s needs and the nation\u2019s long-term interests, which a professional civil service is uniquely positioned to understand, rather than a narrow responsiveness to partisan commands.\n\nIn view of these concerns, this critique strongly urges that the proposed rule be reconsidered and withdrawn. Any civil service reforms should fortify, not weaken, the merit-based, apolitical character of our federal workforce. Instead of dismantling protections, we should invest in better training for managers, streamlined but fair procedures, and recruitment of skilled personnel \u2013 steps that can improve performance without politicization. The stakes are high: if implemented, this rule could inflict lasting harm on the integrity of the civil service and, by extension, the health of American democracy. As the Pendleton Act architects knew well, to protect our republic we must ensure that government positions are filled by those loyal to the Constitution and public service, not to party bosses. The wall between partisan politics and the professional civil service was built deliberately and with bipartisan wisdom; it should not be torn down. Preserving an independent, professional civil service is essential to guard against political interference and abuse, and to uphold a government that is of the people, by the people, and for all the people \u2013 not just for the victors of the latest election.",

    "comment": "As a friend of a federal employee, I\u2019m concerned that the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule (RIN: 3206-AO80) is too broad and could harm non-policy staff by removing long-standing civil service protections.\n\nMany federal workers serve in and analytical, operational, and technical roles that do not involve policy-making. Yet there are reports of mass lists being prepared for reclassification\u2014regardless of official duties. This threatens employee rights and disrupts the services the public depends on.\n\nOPM must define \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d using position description language, as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(b)(2). Without tying this designation to documented duties, the rule risks misclassifying workers unlawfully and invites legal and operational issues. The Supreme Court has required narrow interpretation of such exemptions (see Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988)).\n\nPlease revise the rule to:\n\n- Limit Schedule Policy/Career to positions with explicit policy-making duties\n\n- Prohibit bulk reclassification by name\n\n- Require a redress process for wrongful designation\n\n- Maintain transparency through public reporting\n\nI have detailed 5 additional concerns below that I would like you to address.\n\n1. Lack of Impact Analysis on DEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility)\n\nSubstantiated Concern:\n\nThe proposed rule does not include any analysis of how removing adverse action protections might disproportionately impact underrepresented groups. Given the federal government\u2019s commitments under Executive Order 14035 (DEIA in the Federal Workforce), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, OPM must assess whether employees from protected classes are more likely to be included in Schedule Policy/Career designations or disproportionately targeted for removal. Failure to assess disparate impact may violate procedural due process and expose the rule to challenge.\n\n2. Inconsistency with Past OPM Policy and Regulatory History\n\nSubstantiated Concern:\n\nJust one year ago, OPM finalized the April 2024 Rule that defined policy-influencing positions as exclusive to political appointees. The proposed reversal lacks a rigorous explanation of why that policy\u2014grounded in statutory interpretation and the administrative record\u2014should be discarded. Under FCC v. Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. 502 (2009), agencies must provide a \u201creasoned explanation\u201d for policy reversals, especially when they disrupt prior reliance interests. The preamble of the 2025 rule references a change in presidential preference but does not meet the required legal threshold for overturning its own recent regulatory interpretation.\n\n3. Lack of Cost-Benefit or Workforce Impact Analysis\n\nSubstantiated Concern:\n\nThe proposed rule contains no quantitative estimate of the number of federal positions likely to be reclassified, the costs of turnover, litigation, or reduced morale. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601\u2013612) and Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 require agencies to assess economic and administrative impacts of significant rules. Without such analysis, the rule may be arbitrary and capricious under the APA.\n\n4. Conflict with Constitutional Due Process Principles\n\nSubstantiated Concern:\n\nRemoving Chapter 43 and 75 protections without offering any meaningful opportunity for notice, response, or appeal may violate employees\u2019 property interest in continued employment, recognized under Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974), and reaffirmed in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985). Career status typically confers this interest. The proposed rule claims reclassified employees remain \u201ccareer,\u201d yet strips their procedural protections, creating a due process inconsistency OPM must resolve.\n\n5. Lack of Guidance to Prevent Misclassification\n\nSubstantiated Concern:\n\nThe proposed rule allows agencies to propose positions for Schedule Policy/Career without requiring a formal checklist, rubric, or crosswalk to determine eligibility. Inconsistent application across agencies will lead to confusion, morale issues, and increased litigation risk. OPM has historically provided interpretive guidance for other excepted service authorities (e.g., Pathways, Schedule A hiring). It should do the same here or risk violating the APA\u2019s \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard due to lack of implementation clarity.\n\nFederal workers deserve fairness, and the public deserves a stable, effective government. Thank you for considering this comment.\n",
    "original_comment": "As a friend of a federal employee, I\u2019m concerned that the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule (RIN: 3206-AO80) is too broad and could harm non-policy staff by removing long-standing civil service protections.\n\nMany federal workers serve in and analytical, operational, and technical roles that do not involve policy-making. Yet there are reports of mass lists being prepared for reclassification\u2014regardless of official duties. This threatens employee rights and disrupts the services the public depends on.\n\nOPM must define \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d using position description language, as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(b)(2). Without tying this designation to documented duties, the rule risks misclassifying workers unlawfully and invites legal and operational issues. The Supreme Court has required narrow interpretation of such exemptions (see Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988)).\n\nPlease revise the rule to:\n\n- Limit Schedule Policy/Career to positions with explicit policy-making duties\n\n- Prohibit bulk reclassification by name\n\n- Require a redress process for wrongful designation\n\n- Maintain transparency through public reporting\n\nI have detailed 5 additional concerns below that I would like you to address.\n\n1. Lack of Impact Analysis on DEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility)\n\nSubstantiated Concern:\n\nThe proposed rule does not include any analysis of how removing adverse action protections might disproportionately impact underrepresented groups. Given the federal government\u2019s commitments under Executive Order 14035 (DEIA in the Federal Workforce), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, OPM must assess whether employees from protected classes are more likely to be included in Schedule Policy/Career designations or disproportionately targeted for removal. Failure to assess disparate impact may violate procedural due process and expose the rule to challenge.\n\n2. Inconsistency with Past OPM Policy and Regulatory History\n\nSubstantiated Concern:\n\nJust one year ago, OPM finalized the April 2024 Rule that defined policy-influencing positions as exclusive to political appointees. The proposed reversal lacks a rigorous explanation of why that policy\u2014grounded in statutory interpretation and the administrative record\u2014should be discarded. Under FCC v. Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. 502 (2009), agencies must provide a \u201creasoned explanation\u201d for policy reversals, especially when they disrupt prior reliance interests. The preamble of the 2025 rule references a change in presidential preference but does not meet the required legal threshold for overturning its own recent regulatory interpretation.\n\n3. Lack of Cost-Benefit or Workforce Impact Analysis\n\nSubstantiated Concern:\n\nThe proposed rule contains no quantitative estimate of the number of federal positions likely to be reclassified, the costs of turnover, litigation, or reduced morale. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601\u2013612) and Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 require agencies to assess economic and administrative impacts of significant rules. Without such analysis, the rule may be arbitrary and capricious under the APA.\n\n4. Conflict with Constitutional Due Process Principles\n\nSubstantiated Concern:\n\nRemoving Chapter 43 and 75 protections without offering any meaningful opportunity for notice, response, or appeal may violate employees\u2019 property interest in continued employment, recognized under Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974), and reaffirmed in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985). Career status typically confers this interest. The proposed rule claims reclassified employees remain \u201ccareer,\u201d yet strips their procedural protections, creating a due process inconsistency OPM must resolve.\n\n5. Lack of Guidance to Prevent Misclassification\n\nSubstantiated Concern:\n\nThe proposed rule allows agencies to propose positions for Schedule Policy/Career without requiring a formal checklist, rubric, or crosswalk to determine eligibility. Inconsistent application across agencies will lead to confusion, morale issues, and increased litigation risk. OPM has historically provided interpretive guidance for other excepted service authorities (e.g., Pathways, Schedule A hiring). It should do the same here or risk violating the APA\u2019s \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard due to lack of implementation clarity.\n\nFederal workers deserve fairness, and the public deserves a stable, effective government.

    "comment": "Please see attached.\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\nI write to express serious legal concerns regarding a specific provision of the proposed rule\npublished on April 23, 2025 (90 FR 17182), which delegates final authority over placement into\nSchedule Policy/Career to the President. This comment addresses the following provision:\n\u201cIn a structural difference with the original Executive Order 13957, the President\u2014not OPM\u2014will\nnow move positions into Schedule Policy/Career. Pursuant to that Executive Order, agencies\nwill review their workforces and petition OPM to recommend that the President move specific\npositions into Schedule Policy/Career. OPM will review these petitions and make the\nrecommendations it deems appropriate. However, the President will make the final decision\nabout which positions go into Schedule Policy/Career. That decision will be effectuated by a new\nexecutive order issued under Presidential\u2014not OPM\u2014authority.\u201d\nThis provision raises multiple legal concerns that warrant the immediate reconsideration and\nwithdrawal of this aspect of the proposal.\n1. Conflict with the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) and Title 5\nThe Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) assigns the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM)\u2014not the President\u2014statutory responsibility to administer the federal civil service. Under\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1103 and 1302, OPM is tasked with prescribing regulations to carry out civil service\nlaws, overseeing personnel practices, and ensuring compliance with merit system principles.\nBy giving the President unilateral authority to move positions into Schedule Policy/Career, the\nproposal bypasses the regulatory authority that Congress expressly vested in OPM. Civil service\nrules are not meant to be redefined through executive order alone\u2014particularly not when the\neffect is to strip career employees of procedural rights.\nThis shift in authority is not merely procedural. It changes the character of thousands of civil\nservice positions and removes them from statutory protections. Such a structural alteration to\nthe civil service framework requires congressional action or, at a minimum, formal rulemaking by\nOPM subject to public notice and comment\u2014not unilateral executive fiat.\n2. Separation of Powers and Nondelegation Concerns\nThe proposed rule allows the President to take final action based on agency petitions and OPM\nreview, culminating in a new executive order for each classification change. This raises\nsignificant separation of powers concerns:\nCivil service protections were created by statute, and changes to those protections should be\nmade by legislative amendment or regulatory action, not individualized executive orders.\nAllowing the President to decide on a case-by-case basis which career positions lose due\nprocess protections under chapters 43 and 75 is a quasi-legislative function, for which the\nPresident lacks direct statutory authority.\nThis approach risks violating the principle established in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.\nSawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), in which the Supreme Court held that the President may not\nexercise lawmaking power independently of Congress or contrary to statutory limits. Here, the\nPresident is acting outside the bounds of Title 5 by reshaping employee protections without\ncongressional delegation.\n3. Lack of Procedural Safeguards and Public Transparency\nBy empowering the President to classify positions through executive orders, this process\nevades the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), including:\nNotice-and-comment rulemaking;\nPublic availability of rationale and supporting data;\nJudicial review of agency action.\nBecause each decision would be issued as a presidential action rather than a regulatory rule,\naffected employees and the public would have no opportunity to object, and the action may be\ninsulated from judicial review. This lack of procedural safeguards undermines the transparency,\naccountability, and fairness required of federal rulemaking and administrative action.\n4. Potential for Political Abuse\nThe proposal's centralization of classification authority in the President\u2014without adherence to\nOPM\u2019s independent processes\u2014opens the door to politically motivated or retaliatory\nreclassifications of civil servants. Even if agency heads or OPM conduct objective reviews, the\nfinal classification decision becomes inherently political when issued directly by the White\nHouse.\nSuch a structure violates the spirit of the Pendleton Act of 1883 and the merit system principles\nin 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301, which protect employees from discrimination, retaliation, or removal based\non political views or affiliations.\nConclusion\nDelegating final classification authority to the President in this manner is contrary to statutory\nmandates, undermines essential due process rights, and politicizes a system designed to\nensure impartial and competent public service. This approach constitutes a major departure\nfrom lawful and accepted civil service practice and raises constitutional and statutory red flags.\nI strongly urge OPM to revise the proposed rule to ensure that any decisions regarding the\nplacement of positions into Schedule Policy/Career:\nAre made exclusively by OPM under formal regulatory procedures;\nComply with Title 5 authorities and the APA;\nPreserve appropriate due process and public transparency;\nPrevent undue political influence over career positions.\n\n\n",

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing.

It was revoked in early 2021 for threatening democratic norms and weakening public trust in federal institutions.\n\nOn a personal note, this proposal threatens the livelihoods of public servants like my father and sister\u2014people who have dedicated their careers to protecting public lands, water systems, and cultural resources. To call their roles \u201cpolicy-determining\u201d simply because they work in high-level, mission-critical positions is not only inaccurate, it\u2019s insulting. These are not partisan actors; they are professionals whose service has spanned multiple administrations.\n\nThis rule would place loyal public servants under a sword of Damocles, where survival depends not on merit, but political loyalty. That is antithetical to the rule of law.\n\nI urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule immediately. Should it move forward, you are legally obligated to address this comment in your rulemaking record under the APA.\n\nThank you for your attention\u2014and for upholding what remains of the civil service ideal.",

    "comment": "OPM's proposed dismissal of reliance interests in Section E regarding \"Schedule Policy/Career\" employees (removing 5 U.S.C. Ch. 43/75 protections) is legally unsound and undermines core civil service principles. OPM initially recognized valid reliance interests: employees' settled expectations based on statutory entitlements (Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532), public/Congressional interest in a non-partisan, expert workforce, and regulatory stability.\n\nThe assertion that these concerns are \"misplaced\" or prejudice is \"small\" fails scrutiny.\n\n * Fallacy of \"Small\" Prejudice: Removing established due process rights (notice, response, appeal) fundamentally alters employment nature from merit-based to potentially at-will, contradicting settled expectations derived from statute. This is not \"small.\"\n\n * Mischaracterized Reliance Interest: The true interest is in procedural due process (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7513, 7701) against arbitrary or pretextual removal\u2014including retaliation for unwelcome expert advice\u2014not, as OPM wrongly claims, an \"ability to violate merit principles.\" Existing rules already address poor performance/misconduct.\n\n * Ignoring Chilling Effect/Censorship Risk: Removing appeals creates a chilling effect. Vague standards (\"injecting personal politics\") invite subjective misuse, silencing employees who offer candid, evidence-based advice differing from political preferences. This harms effective governance and risks censoring legitimate dissent or warnings about policy flaws. Assurances against politicization ring hollow without independent review.\n\n * Undermining CSRA & Merit Principles: The proposal upsets the balance struck by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), weakening Merit System Principles (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b), esp. Principles 1 & 2) and protections against Prohibited Personnel Practices (\u00a7 2302), particularly political coercion or arbitrary action.\n\n * Improper Deference: OPM's stated deference to Presidential cost-benefit analysis over its independent statutory duty (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103) to uphold the merit system framework established by Congress is inappropriate.\n\nProposed Revisions to Mitigate Risks:\n\nTo prevent censorship of good-faith policy disagreement and protect expert advice:\n\n * Retain Ch. 43/75 Protections: Best solution. Address performance/misconduct via existing processes.\n\n * Narrowly Define Scope: If schedule proceeds, restrict strictly to high-level, final policy decision-makers, excluding advisory/analytical roles.\n\n * Clarify Removal Standards: Replace vague terms with objective criteria focused on misconduct/performance failure, explicitly excluding good-faith advice/analysis offered through proper channels.\n\n * Protect Professional Judgment: Add safeguards (e.g., via \u00a7 2302(b)) explicitly protecting employees from adverse action based on the substance of good-faith professional judgment or analysis.\n\n * Maintain Independent Review: Retain meaningful, independent review (even if modified) to verify cause and prevent pretextual removals.\n\n\nOPM's rationale in Section E is flawed and dangerous to the non-partisan, expert civil service. It minimizes statutory rights, misrepresents employee interests, ignores chilling effects, and contravenes the CSRA's intent. OPM should withdraw this harmful proposal or substantially revise it to preserve essential procedural safeguards against politicization and censorship, ensuring government effectiveness and accountability.",

    "comment": "As friends and supporters of federal employees, we are submitting this comment to express concern about the proposed creation of Schedule Policy/Career and the harmful impact it may have on the career civil service.\n\n\n\nWe understand the goal of this rule is to promote accountability and responsiveness in government. However, we believe the rule as written is too broad and puts hard-working public servants at risk of losing their due process rights, even if their jobs have nothing to do with policy-making or political decision-making.\n\n\n\nMany federal employees work in roles such as data analysis, public benefits processing, casework, training, operations, finance, HR, or technical program support. These are not policy positions. Yet we have heard troubling reports that entire lists of employees are being considered for reclassification under this new schedule\u2014even those whose work has nothing to do with shaping or influencing federal policy.\n\n\n\nThis raises several concerns:\n\n1. Risk of Wrongful Reclassification\n\n\n\nThe proposed rule lacks a clear mechanism for verifying whether a job is truly policy-influencing. There is no requirement that the official position description contain language such as \u201cpolicy-making\u201d or \u201cpolicy-determining,\u201d despite 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(b)(2) limiting exemption from adverse action protections only to those roles. Without this linkage, agencies may reclassify individuals based on assumptions or proximity to policy\u2014not on actual duties. This lack of guardrails leaves OPM vulnerable to implementing the rule in a manner inconsistent with the statutory language.\n\n2. Loss of Basic Workplace Protections\n\n\n\nEmployees reclassified into Schedule Policy/Career would lose appeal rights under Chapters 43 and 75, even if removed for pretextual or retaliatory reasons. While the proposal states that removals may not be politically motivated, there is no independent enforcement or redress mechanism provided to ensure fairness. A non-political civil service requires more than intent\u2014it requires due process.\n\n3. Impact on the Public\n\n\n\nFederal employees are the people who process veterans\u2019 benefits, issue immigration documents, manage public lands, and oversee safety regulations. Disrupting their stability with vague classifications and at-will removals will ultimately reduce the quality and timeliness of services provided to the American public.\n\n4. Potential for Political Abuse\n\n\n\nRemoving long-standing civil service protections creates a slippery slope toward politicization, especially if roles are misclassified without oversight. It risks undoing over a century of reforms designed to insulate public servants from political pressure and retribution.\n\nWhat OPM Should Do\n\n\n\nWe urge OPM to revise the proposed rule to:\n\nDefine \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d using the actual position description language, requiring reference to policy development, regulatory discretion, or executive direction.\n\nExclude operational, analytical, and support positions that do not meet that threshold.\n\nProhibit bulk reclassification via personnel lists and instead require individual position-by-position justifications.\n\nCreate a redress mechanism for employees who believe they were wrongly classified or removed.\n\nPublish aggregate data on reclassification activity to maintain public transparency.\n\nSubstantiated Concern for Agency Response (APA Compliance)\n\n\n\nThe current rule lacks a clear, operational definition of \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d tied to official position descriptions, yet uses that term as the legal basis for exempting employees from adverse action protections under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(b)(2). Courts have previously required that such exceptions be applied narrowly (see Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988)). If OPM proceeds without enforcing an objective PD-based standard, it may violate its own statutory authority and expose the agency to future legal challenges or inconsistent application across agencies. OPM must address this definitional gap to ensure lawful implementation.\n\nIn Closing\n\n\n\nWe support accountability. But federal public servants deserve fair treatment\u2014not vague reclassification standards and sudden loss of rights. We urge OPM to revise the rule to reflect constitutional principles, operational needs, and the values of a nonpartisan civil service.\n\n\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.",

    "comment": "Public Comment Opposing the Reinstatement of Schedule F\n\nI write to strongly oppose the proposed reinstatement or expansion of Schedule F, which would undermine the merit-based principles that have guided the federal civil service for over a century. Schedule F seeks to reclassify certain policy-related federal positions to exempt status, thereby enabling their dismissal without cause or due process protections. This proposal is not only contrary to the foundational values of a nonpartisan federal workforce but also threatens the continuity, competence, and integrity of government operations.\n\nThe merit system, codified in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, was designed to ensure that hiring and firing decisions in the federal workforce are based on competence, not political loyalty. Reintroducing Schedule F would effectively reverse these protections, placing tens of thousands of career civil servants at risk of politically motivated termination. This undermines the principle of a government that serves the people impartially, irrespective of the political party in power. Historically, the move away from the patronage system\u2014especially following the Pendleton Act of 1883\u2014was a key advancement in professionalizing the civil service and ensuring effective governance.\n\nThe implementation of Schedule F would open the door to politicizing crucial policy roles, destabilizing agencies, and discouraging skilled professionals from public service. America\u2019s resilience depends on a trusted, nonpartisan civil service capable of withstanding political transitions. The federal workforce deserves the stability and fairness promised by existing civil service protections. I urge the administration to abandon any effort to resurrect Schedule F and instead reaffirm its commitment to a professional, impartial civil service grounded in merit and accountability.",

Civil servants are tasked with upholding the Constitution rather than serving partisan beliefs and so a healthy government requires civil servants rather than a partisan workforce. \n\nThis issue is critical across the federal workforce, but will be particularly problematic for American science and innovation. This proposed change of policy will inevitably degrade science in the US. Science should inform policy but policy should not be the primary driver of science. Therefore it remains critical that funding decisions be set and priorities be made by experienced, non-partisan civil servants with extensive science training. It is already the case that the President and Congress can influence the direction of science by passing laws that emphasize and support funding priority areas. Federal Science agencies have always been responsive to these priorities. These however should be implemented by a non-partisan and scientifically trained workforce. ",

    "comment": "This comment responds to Section E (\"Reliance Interests\") of the proposed rule and fundamental deficiencies in OPM's administrative process under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and potential overreach of OPM statutory authority.\n\n * Failure to Provide Reasoned Explanation for Policy Reversal (APA \u00a7 706(2)(A)): OPM's current proposal represents a stark reversal of its previously stated position, which acknowledged the validity and importance of employee, public, Congressional, and regulated entity reliance interests in the stability and procedural fairness afforded by Chapters 43 and 75. Under established administrative law, an agency changing its position must, at minimum, \"display awareness that it is changing position\" and \"show that there are good reasons for the new policy.\" FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). The explanation provided in Section E \u2013 asserting concerns are \"largely misplaced\" and prejudice is \"small\" \u2013 is conclusory. It fails to provide a detailed, evidence-based analysis explaining why its prior assessment of these significant reliance interests was erroneous or why the newly asserted \"policy benefits\" so clearly outweigh them now when they did not before. This lack of reasoned explanation renders the reversal arbitrary and capricious.\n\n * Arbitrary Cost-Benefit Analysis and Lack of Evidentiary Support (APA \u00a7 706(2)(A)): The determination that reliance interests are \"outweighed by the policy benefits\" requires a rational balancing based on evidence. OPM asserts harms like \"poor performance, misconduct, corruption, and career employees injecting partisanship,\" but provides no empirical evidence demonstrating: (a) the prevalence of these issues specifically among policy-influencing employees that cannot be addressed under existing Chapter 43/75 procedures, and (b) how removing appeal rights for this group is a proportionate and effective remedy directly tailored to these specific harms. Agencies must \"examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\" Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (citation omitted). Simply declaring that the \"necessity of a competent, ethical, and democratically accountable government\" subordinates reliance interests, without demonstrating how this specific rule change achieves those aims more effectively than the existing system, and without quantifying or substantiating the alleged harms being remedied, constitutes an arbitrary and unsupported conclusion. Furthermore, OPM fails to adequately consider the substantial costs associated with its proposal, such as loss of institutional knowledge, increased recruitment challenges for expert roles, and erosion of trust within the workforce.\n\n * Exceeding Delegated Statutory Authority (Title 5, U.S. Code): OPM's authority to regulate the civil service (e.g., under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1103, 1301-02, 3301-02) must be exercised within the framework established by Congress. Congress explicitly defined the scope of adverse action appeal rights in Chapter 75, specifying which employees are covered (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511) and providing limited, specific exceptions (e.g., probationary periods, certain agencies/positions). The proposed rule effectively creates a broad new functional exception for \"policy-influencing\" roles within the competitive service, removing them from Chapter 75 protections. It is highly questionable whether OPM's general rulemaking authority extends to carving out such a significant portion of the career workforce from statutory protections explicitly granted by Congress, based on vaguely defined job duties rather than clear statutory language. This action appears less like administering the law and more like rewriting it, infringing upon legislative prerogative.\n\n * Major Questions Doctrine Implications: The proposed creation of Schedule Policy/Career represents a fundamental restructuring of the federal civil service with vast economic and political significance, potentially affecting tens or hundreds of thousands of employees and altering the balance between political appointees and career staff. Such a \"transformative expansion\" of executive control over the career workforce, significantly impacting a long-standing statutory scheme, implicates the Major Questions Doctrine. Under this doctrine, agencies asserting power over issues of major significance typically require clear, explicit authorization from Congress. West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022). OPM cannot assume that its general administrative authority implicitly grants it the power to make such a fundamental change to the civil service system established by the CSRA without clear Congressional direction.",

    "comment": "I respectfully submit this formal comment in opposition to the proposed rule titled \u201cImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\u201d (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004-0001). While accountability in government is important, this rule undermines core legal and institutional safeguards that ensure the federal workforce remains competent, impartial, and protected from political abuse.\n\nThe proposed creation of a \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d category\u2014functionally similar to the rescinded Schedule F\u2014would strip civil servants of their due process rights and convert large portions of the workforce into at-will employees. This directly conflicts with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301, 2302), which protects employees from retaliation, political coercion, and arbitrary dismissal.\n\nThis rule politicizes public service by targeting policy-related positions and risks returning us to a spoils system long rejected by American governance. Institutions such as the Congressional Research Service, the Government Accountability Office, and the National Academy of Public Administration have warned against such moves. Public trust, operational stability, and the attractiveness of federal service would all be diminished.\n\nThe rule also contradicts foundational American principles\u2014justice, neutrality, and the rule of law\u2014by turning federal employment into a loyalty test. As noted by Columbia Law Professor Peter Strauss, these reforms would undermine the Constitution\u2019s vision of neutral competence in government.\n\nFor these reasons, I urge OPM to withdraw the proposed rule. A full version of my comment with legal citations and supporting evidence is attached as a PDF.\n\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\nApril 23, 2025\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management\nAttn: Regulatory Affairs Division\n1900 E Street, NW\nWashington, DC 20415\nSubject: Formal Comment Opposing Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004-0001\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing to express my unequivocal opposition to the proposed rule titled \"Improving\nPerformance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" (Docket ID:\nOPM-2025-0004-0001). While enhancing performance and accountability in government\nis a worthy objective, this proposal is legally questionable, substantively harmful,\nhistorically regressive, and fundamentally contrary to American ideals of fairness, justice,\nand the rule of law.\nErosion of Due Process and Merit System Protections\nThis proposal seeks to create a new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d classification that would\nstrip federal employees of due process rights and render them at-will employees. This\nundermines core protections enshrined in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2301, \u00a7 2302), which prohibits removals based on political affiliation, whistleblowing,\nor personal bias.\nThe merit system principles\u2014long regarded as a bulwark against politicized\ngovernance\u2014would be dismantled in favor of a structure allowing for arbitrary removals.\nThese changes mirror the rescinded Executive Order 13957, which created Schedule F\nand was met with bipartisan condemnation. Its subsequent revocation by Executive Order\n14003 reaffirmed the importance of an apolitical, merit-based workforce.\nPoliticization of the Federal Workforce\nBy enabling reclassification and removal of policy-adjacent employees based on\nsubjective determinations, the rule invites a return to a spoils system\u2014an approach\nAmerica abandoned with the Pendleton Act of 1883. The United States has long\nmaintained a professional civil service to ensure continuity and competence across\nadministrations. Reinstating an at-will structure for thousands of federal roles undermines\nthis nonpartisan tradition and raises the risk of mass purges motivated by ideology rather\nthan performance.\nIn 2020, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) warned that Schedule F-type reforms\nwould \u201cseverely erode civil service protections and could politicize up to tens of\nthousands of federal positions.\u201d Public interest organizations such as the Partnership for\nPublic Service, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and National\nAcademy of Public Administration (NAPA) issued similar warnings.\nContrary to American Democratic Ideals\nThe proposed rule contradicts foundational American values\u2014justice, impartiality, and\nconstitutional governance. The American ideal is a government that serves the people,\nnot a political faction. An independent civil service is essential to that goal. By replacing\nmerit-based employment with political loyalty tests, the rule invites corruption,\nsuppresses dissent, and weakens the institutional checks that underpin our republic.\nAs Professor Peter Strauss of Columbia Law School aptly observed in 2020, Schedule F-\nstyle proposals are \"an invitation to create a spoils system that violates the fundamental\nAmerican principle of neutral competence in government.\" These changes align more\nclosely with authoritarian regimes than with democratic governance.\nEmpirical Evidence of Harm\nHistorical and international evidence demonstrates that politicized bureaucracies perform\nworse and suffer greater instability. The OECD 2020 Government at a Glance Report\nranks the U.S. civil service among the most professional and impartial globally.\nWeakening these protections would reduce effectiveness and public trust.\nAccording to a 2021 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, impartiality in\nfederal employment is essential to safeguarding whistleblowers, rooting out corruption,\nand maintaining public accountability. The Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity\nand Efficiency (CIGIE) has repeatedly emphasized the importance of employment\nprotections in ensuring oversight and ethical conduct.\nOperational and Human Capital Risks\nSubjecting federal employees to at-will status introduces operational instability and\nseverely harms recruitment and retention. The 2020 Schedule F initiative was estimated\nto impact over 50,000 employees. If revived under this rule, the scope could expand even\nfurther, threatening institutional memory, workforce morale, and mission readiness.\nCivil servants are already facing threats to job security amid growing polarization. This\nrule will exacerbate that instability, making federal careers less attractive to future public\nservants\u2014particularly those with the technical expertise and integrity that modern\ngovernance demands.\nConclusion\nThis proposal does not promote accountability; it erodes institutional integrity,\nundermines constitutional principles, and invites politicization at the expense of public\ntrust. The United States deserves a government staffed by professionals who are\nempowered to speak truthfully, serve impartially, and uphold their oath to the\nConstitution without fear of political retaliation.\nI strongly urge OPM to withdraw this proposal in its entirety. The future of American\ngovernance\u2014and the legitimacy of our civil service\u2014depends on it.\nSincerely,\n\u201cA Concerned Citizen and Public Servant (Name withheld for safety and privacy)\u201d\n\n\n",

    "comment": "Thank you for reviewing these comments. Respectfully, this proposed rule making action should be rejected due to fundamental incompatibility with the enforcement architecture of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and its disruption of the exclusive statutory framework governing performance and conduct-based adverse actions. I've outlined several reasons below why the proposed action is untenable for OPM to pursue further.\n\n * Nullification of Prohibited Personnel Practice (PPP) Enforcement: A cornerstone of the CSRA is the protection against PPPs (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)). For covered employees facing major adverse actions, the primary forum for vindicating these rights\u2014particularly challenging actions potentially based on political affiliation (\u00a7 2302(b)(1)(E)), reprisal for whistleblowing (\u00a7 2302(b)(8)), or reprisal for exercising appeal rights (\u00a7 2302(b)(9))\u2014is through an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) under Chapter 75. Removing MSPB appeal rights for \"Schedule Policy/Career\" employees effectively neutralizes this vital enforcement mechanism for the very group often most vulnerable to political pressure or retaliation related to policy execution. This eviscerates a key check Congress established against politicization, leaving statutory prohibitions as rights without effective remedies in the context of removal or demotion. Reliance on the Office of Special Counsel alone is not a substitute for direct, individual appeal rights with independent adjudication.\n\n * Circumvention of Exclusive Statutory Schemes (Chapters 43 & 75): Congress deliberately established Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5 as the detailed, comprehensive, and exclusive statutory procedures for addressing unacceptable performance and misconduct (or other cause) for covered career employees. These chapters reflect specific legislative choices regarding grounds for action, procedural requirements (notice, opportunity to respond), burden of proof, and independent review. The proposed rule creates a parallel, non-statutory removal track based on ill-defined functional criteria (\"policy-influencing\") and subjective standards (\"confidence,\" \"alignment\"). This constitutes an impermissible attempt by OPM to bypass the exclusive remedial schemes mandated by Congress, effectively allowing agencies to remove employees for reasons or via processes not sanctioned by the controlling statutes. It violates the principle that where Congress has enacted a specific, comprehensive remedial scheme, agency action must adhere to that scheme.\n\n * Undermining the CSRA's Integrated Design: The CSRA created an integrated system balancing management needs with robust employee protections enforced through MSPB review. This structure was intended to prevent the very type of politically convenient removals facilitated by the proposed rule. By exempting a large group from MSPB oversight based on regulatory redefinition rather than statutory amendment, OPM fractures this integrated design. It selectively removes the element (independent appeal) intended to ensure the system operates based on merit and law, not political favor or policy conformity.\n\n * Implicit Reliance on Non-Statutory Removal Authority: The rationale implies agencies need authority to remove employees in these roles for reasons other than those specified and actionable under Chapters 43/75 (i.e., lack of \"confidence\" untethered to misconduct or performance). OPM fails to identify any statutory basis for such broad, subjective removal authority over career competitive service employees whom Congress explicitly placed under Chapter 75's protections (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A)). Asserting this authority via regulation contradicts the statutory framework.\n\nIn sum, the proposed rule's dismissal of reliance interests ignores the reliance on the CSRA's enforcement mechanisms and statutory exclusivity. By crippling PPP enforcement through MSPB appeals and circumventing the specific procedures mandated by Congress in Chapters 43 and 75, the rule fundamentally conflicts with the controlling statutory law. This constitutes legal flaw warranting the proposal's rejection. Should the president believe such reforms are necessary, he is permitted to lobby for the requisite authority on the Hill and this alone is the correct vehicle for achieving these modifications.",

There are countless jobs within the government that require extensive technical knowledge that is difficult to replace and there are already processes in place to fire workers if their performance falls short of expectations.  It is also concerning that the president\u2019s agenda should be considered at all in these firings.  What does a president\u2019s agenda have to do with collecting and publishing economic data, weather reports, or providing disaster relief.  The civil servants doing these jobs should only be concerned with doing the best job possible, not how their work will land with the administration.\n\nIn addition, this administration has not been known to pick the most qualified people for the positions they fill.

There are countless jobs within the government that require extensive technical knowledge that is difficult to replace and there are already processes in place to fire workers if their performance falls short of expectations.

What does a president\u2019s agenda have to do with collecting and publishing economic data, weather reports, or providing disaster relief.  The civil servants doing these jobs should only be concerned with doing the best job possible, not how their work will land with the administration.\n\nIn addition, this administration has not been known to pick the most qualified people for the positions they fill.

    "comment": "I am writing to express strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) proposed rule OPM-2025-0004-0001, which seeks to reclassify approximately 50,000 federal employees into a newly designated Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) category. This proposal, a revival of the previously rescinded Schedule F, threatens the foundational principles of a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service and poses significant risks to the integrity, efficiency, and accountability of federal operations.\n\nErosion of Merit-Based Protections\n\nThe cornerstone of the federal civil service is its commitment to merit-based hiring and retention, ensuring that employment decisions are grounded in qualifications and performance rather than political affiliation. By reclassifying positions into Schedule P/C, the proposed rule would strip affected employees of critical protections against arbitrary dismissal, effectively making them at-will employees. This undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was enacted to prevent politicization and ensure a competent and impartial federal workforce.\n\nIncreased Risk of Politicization\n\nThe reintroduction of Schedule P/C opens the door to replacing experienced, nonpartisan professionals with individuals selected for their political loyalty rather than expertise. Such a shift could compromise the objectivity of policy analysis and implementation, leading to decisions that serve partisan interests over the public good. The National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE) has rightly noted that this move \"opens the door to replacing nonpartisan, professional civil servants with political loyalists\".\n\nUndermining Institutional Knowledge and Continuity\n\nFederal agencies rely on the institutional knowledge and continuity provided by career civil servants. Reclassifying positions and removing job protections could lead to a loss of experienced personnel, disrupting agency operations and diminishing the government's ability to effectively serve the public. The potential for mass dismissals based on political considerations threatens the stability and effectiveness of federal programs.\n\nLegal and Ethical Concerns\n\nThe proposed rule raises serious legal and ethical questions. The previous iteration, Schedule F, faced legal challenges and was ultimately rescinded due to concerns about its legality and potential for abuse. Reintroducing a similar framework disregards these concerns and may once again lead to protracted legal battles, diverting resources and attention from the government's primary responsibilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed reclassification of federal positions into Schedule Policy/Career represents a significant departure from the principles that have long safeguarded the integrity and effectiveness of the federal workforce. It threatens to politicize the civil service, erode merit-based protections, and disrupt the continuity of government operations. I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule and instead focus on strengthening the existing merit-based system that ensures a competent, impartial, and stable federal workforce.",

    "comment": "\nComment on Proposed Rule Regarding Schedule F Reinstatement\n\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would reclassify up to 50,000 federal employees under a new Schedule F category. This proposal represents a fundamental threat to the integrity, effectiveness, and nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service.\n\nPeer-reviewed research in public administration has consistently shown that agencies with higher concentrations of politically appointed or at-will employees tend to experience reduced effectiveness. The proposed Schedule F framework would introduce short-term political incentives into roles that require continuity, technical expertise, and a long-term strategic focus. These roles are not well-suited for at-will employment, as they often involve implementing complex policies, conducting long-range research, and maintaining critical public services.\n\nMoreover, the merit-based protections afforded to career civil servants are not bureaucratic obstacles\u2014they are foundational safeguards that ensure policy stability, operational consistency, and resistance to politicization. Reclassifying these employees would erode those protections and increase the risk of politicized purges, loss of institutional knowledge, and significant disruption to agency missions.\n\nThe U.S. government must maintain a professional civil service capable of upholding public trust and executing policy across administrations. This proposal runs counter to that objective and threatens long-term governance capacity. I urge OPM to reject this rule and reaffirm its commitment to a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n[Your Name, Optional Title or Affiliation]\n\n\u2e3b\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like help attaching references, supporting documents, or customizing this with your credentials or agency experience.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the proposed rule to create a new \"Schedule Policy/Career\" excepted service category, which would effectively eliminate due process protections for a broad swath of career federal employees. This rule is not only ill-conceived and contrary to the longstanding principles of a nonpartisan and merit-based civil service, but it also invites constitutional and statutory legal challenges that could destabilize government operations and undermine the public trust.\n\nThe Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), 5 U.S.C. sections 7501-7514 and 4301-4305, establishes the exclusive framework governing adverse actions and performance-based removals in federal employment. Congress enacted these provisions to balance efficiency in government operations with employee rights, explicitly ensuring that career employees are protected against arbitrary or politically motivated removals.\n\nThis proposed rule attempts to circumvent the CSRA by exploiting an exemption intended for true political appointees-not career staff-under 5 U.S.C. section 7511(b)(2). It transforms otherwise protected positions into effectively political roles without the safeguards of Senate confirmation or public accountability. This is a deliberate end-run around the merit system principles enshrined in 5 U.S.C. section 2301 and undermines Congress's clear legislative intent.\n\nBy removing Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeal rights and procedural safeguards under chapters 43 and 75, the proposed rule likely violates constitutional due process for employees with a property interest in their continued federal employment. As established in Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), due process requires meaningful notice and an opportunity to be heard before termination when public employment rights exist. Furthermore, Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974), affirmed that federal employees are entitled to due process where statutory procedures exist, and the CSRA is precisely such a statutory scheme. Attempting to convert these positions into \"at-will\" without statutory repeal opens the rule to facial constitutional challenge.\n\nThe Pendleton Act of 1883 and the Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912 laid the foundation for a nonpartisan civil service that is protected from political manipulation. This rule returns us to a 19th-century spoils system under a modern guise. It empowers agency heads and the President to remove career employees at will for vague, ideological reasons under the guise of \"performance\" or \"policy resistance.\"\n\nIf implemented, this rule will chill internal dissent, suppress whistleblowers, and threaten the institutional memory critical to sound governance-thus violating 5 U.S.C. sec 2302(b)(8) (whistleblower protections) and potentially violating the First Amendment rights of public employees to speak on matters of public concern (Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563 (1968)).\n\nThe criteria for classifying a position as \"policy-influencing\" are overly broad, vague, and arbitrary. This vagueness opens the door for legally impermissible removals-including those motivated by political affiliation, protected speech, or discrimination. As such, it may violate both the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and constitutional protections against arbitrary government action (Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29 (1983)).\n\nThe proposed rule will cause significant disruptions in federal operations. It will weaken institutional expertise by facilitating mass dismissals of experienced civil servants, undermine recruitment and retention efforts due to decreased job security and politicized oversight, and erode the public\u2019s trust in the neutrality and integrity of federal agencies.\n\nIf enacted, this rule is likely to be swiftly challenged in federal court under the APA, the CSRA, and the Constitution. Litigants will argue that it exceeds statutory authority, constitutes arbitrary and capricious rulemaking, and deprives employees of vested due process rights without congressional approval. Courts may well enjoin implementation during litigation, stalling key agency functions.\n\nThis proposal is a dangerous and unlawful attempt to upend over a century of nonpartisan civil service protections. It undermines the CSRA, violates due process, and opens the door to arbitrary dismissals that will not only erode public confidence in the federal government but will also place tens of thousands of dedicated career professionals at risk of politically motivated retaliation.\n\nThe proposed rule ignores the role that civil service protections play in ensuring that public employees can faithfully and impartially carry out the law, regardless of political changes in administration. Undermining these protections threatens the integrity and effectiveness of government and the constitutional structure of checks and balances. OPM must withdraw this rule in full.\n\nV/r,\nA Concerned Federal Employee Acting in a Personal Capacity",

    "comment": "CIVIL SERVICE RULE OPPOSITION\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\nThe Detrimental Effects of the Proposed Rule on Civil Service\nPerformance and Accountability\n1. Introduction: The Perils of Politicizing the Civil Service\nThe proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on April 23, 2025 1, seeks to\nimplement Executive Order 14171 and establish a new personnel category known as\nSchedule Policy/Career within the civil service. The stated aim is to enhance\nperformance, accountability, and responsiveness within the federal workforce.1\nHowever, this initiative, which reinstates and amends the previous Schedule F\nexecutive order 2, presents a significant threat to the foundational principles of a\nmerit-based, nonpartisan civil service. This report argues against the implementation\nof this rule, asserting that it undermines the established merit system, erodes job\nsecurity for dedicated career professionals, risks increased politicization and a decline\nin government effectiveness, raises substantial legal and statutory concerns, and\ncould negatively impact accountability mechanisms, including whistleblower\nprotections. The purported objectives of improved \"performance, accountability, and\nresponsiveness\" appear to be contradicted by the very mechanisms proposed in the\nrule. The focus on \"policy-influencing\" roles, coupled with the removal of critical job\nprotections, suggests an underlying intention to exert greater political control over the\ncivil service rather than a genuine effort to enhance governmental functions.\nFurthermore, the reintroduction of this type of reform, following previous attempts,\nindicates a persistent agenda to fundamentally reshape the civil service in a manner\nthat could lead to instability and a loss of invaluable institutional knowledge with each\nchange in presidential administration.\n2. Undermining Merit-Based Principles: A Return to Patronage\nA cornerstone of the proposed rule is the incorporation of Schedule Policy/Career as\nan excepted service schedule specifically targeting career positions with policy\ninfluence.1 This shift fundamentally challenges the long-standing merit-based\nprinciples that have traditionally governed the selection and retention of civil servants.\nThe establishment of Schedule F, the precursor to Schedule Policy/Career, was\ndesigned to remove competitive examination requirements, potentially paving the way\nfor appointments based on factors other than demonstrated competence and\nexpertise.3 This approach contrasts sharply with the traditional merit-based system,\nwhere recruitment and disciplinary actions are ideally based on qualifications and\nperformance.4 Under the proposed rule, employees in Schedule Policy/Career\npositions could be hired and potentially dismissed at the executive's discretion, raising\nthe specter of political affiliation playing a dominant role in staffing decisions, thereby\nundermining the principle of selecting individuals based on their training and\nexperience.4 Public sentiment overwhelmingly favors a merit-based civil service, with\n95% of Americans believing that hiring and promotion should be based on merit\nrather than political beliefs.5 The proposed rule, therefore, stands in direct opposition\nto the widely held view that competence and qualifications should be the primary\ndeterminants of civil service employment. This deviation from merit-based hiring\npractices carries the risk of diminishing the overall quality and expertise within the\ncivil service. When individuals are selected based on political considerations rather\nthan their skills and qualifications, it can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and a decline in\nthe quality of government programs and services. Such a system could also cultivate a\nculture where political loyalty takes precedence over professional competence,\nincentivizing individuals to prioritize pleasing political superiors over serving the public\ninterest with their best judgment and expertise. The proposed rule thus presents a\ndanger of reverting the civil service system to a patronage model, reminiscent of\nhistorical periods characterized by corruption and a lack of qualified personnel.7\n3. Erosion of Due Process and Job Security: The \"At-Will\" Threat\nA particularly concerning aspect of the proposed rule is the clarification that\nemployees in Schedule C and the newly created Schedule Policy/Career positions will\nnot be covered by the procedural requirements of chapter 75 of Title 5 of the U.S.\nCode, which govern adverse actions and appeals.1 This represents a significant\ndeparture from established civil service protections, stripping a considerable portion\nof the federal workforce of crucial safeguards against unfair dismissal. Under the\nframework of Schedule F, which Schedule Policy/Career effectively reinstates,\npositions would lose the \"for cause\" requirement for removal, meaning that\nemployees could be terminated at will, akin to political appointees, without the need\nfor documented performance or conduct issues.3 Employees reclassified under this\nschedule would forfeit rights traditionally afforded to government employees through\nthe Civil Service Reform Act, including advance notice of disciplinary actions,\nprotection against politically motivated or arbitrary firing, merit-based performance\nstandards, and the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).4\nFurthermore, the proposed rule seeks to amend 5 CFR part 432 to exclude Schedule\nPolicy/Career positions from the performance-based removal procedures outlined in\nchapter 43 of Title 5.1 This further restricts the avenues for appeal and challenges to\ntermination, even in cases where poor performance is alleged. The absence of job\nsecurity and due process protections could trigger a significant exodus of\nexperienced and skilled civil servants seeking more stable employment opportunities\nelsewhere. This \"brain drain\" would further deplete the government's expertise and\ninstitutional knowledge.8 Moreover, the precarious nature of employment under this\nrule could create a chilling effect on civil servants' willingness to offer candid and\nobjective advice, especially if their perspectives diverge from the administration's\npolicies, as they would understandably fear reprisal in the form of dismissal.9 By\neliminating fundamental due process protections, the proposed rule effectively\ntransforms career civil servants in policy-influencing roles into at-will employees,\nthereby undermining the stability and professionalism that are essential for an\neffective civil service.\n4. Increased Politicization and Reduced Government Effectiveness: Loyalty\nOver Expertise\nThe proposed rule explicitly states that while employees in Schedule Policy/Career\npositions are not required to pledge personal loyalty to the President, they must\ndiligently implement the President's policies, with failure to do so constituting grounds\nfor dismissal.1 Despite the disclaimer regarding personal loyalty, the emphasis on\nstrict adherence to the administration's policies and the threat of termination for\nnon-compliance can be interpreted as establishing a de facto loyalty test. Research\nhas consistently demonstrated that a reliance on political appointees and the\npoliticization of the civil service undermine government performance.11 Studies\nconducted during previous administrations have indicated that more politicized\nenvironments within the federal government negatively impact the incentives for\ncareer bureaucrats to invest in their skills, often leading them to seek employment\noutside of government.11 This further corroborates the concern about a potential\n\"brain drain\" and the detrimental effects on skill development and retention within the\ncivil service. The consensus among experts is that politicization generally leads to a\ndecline in government capacity and overall performance.11 Concrete examples\nillustrate the potential for negative consequences, such as government agencies with\na higher number of political appointees being more likely to award government\ncontracts to firms connected to the ruling party, even if those firms do not offer the\nmost cost-effective solutions.12 The emphasis on policy alignment over independent\nexpertise could also lead to the suppression or manipulation of crucial scientific and\ntechnical information if it happens to contradict the administration's political agenda.\nThis could have severe implications for public health and safety in agencies like the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).7\nFurthermore, increased political turnover within the civil service, a likely outcome of\nthe proposed rule, could disrupt the continuity of long-term projects and initiatives\nthat require sustained effort and expertise across multiple administrations. This would\nhinder the government's ability to effectively address complex challenges that\ndemand consistent attention and a long-term perspective.8 By prioritizing the\nimplementation of a specific political agenda over the independent expertise of\ncareer civil servants, the proposed rule risks transforming the civil service into an\ninstrument of partisan objectives, thereby undermining its fundamental purpose of\nserving the public interest based on professional competence and neutrality.\n5. Legal and Statutory Concerns: Exceeding Executive Authority\nThe proposed rule and the underlying Executive Order 14171 have already faced\nsignificant legal challenges. Plaintiffs have argued that the Executive Order is unlawful\nbecause it exceeds the statutory authority granted to the President by Congress and\nruns contrary to congressional intent, particularly as it seeks to reclassify career\nemployees rather than solely political appointees.14 Legal complaints assert that the\nimplementation of Executive Order 14171 would facilitate the dismantling of the civil\nservice and its replacement with political loyalists, thereby violating the Civil Service\nReform Act (CSRA) and infringing upon Congress's constitutional authority to\nestablish and regulate the civil service system to ensure a merit-based federal\nworkforce free from political retribution.15 Lawsuits have also been filed contending\nthat the President has illegally overstepped his authority by attempting to unilaterally\nroll back existing regulations that protect the rights of civil servants.16 The National\nTreasury Employees Union (NTEU) has similarly filed suit to block the implementation\nof Schedule F, arguing that it is \"contrary to congressional intent\" and wrongly applies\nemployment rules intended for political appointees to career staff, deprives federal\nemployees of their promised due process rights, and disregards established Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) regulations.18 The attempt by the OPM to bypass the\ntraditional notice-and-comment rulemaking process for rescinding portions of\nprevious regulations raises further legal concerns regarding transparency and\nadherence to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).20 The OPM's assertion of a\nvague presidential authority to \"nullify\" existing federal rules without following the\nstandard rulemaking procedures mandated by the APA is likely to face legal scrutiny.\nShould the courts ultimately rule against the administration in these legal challenges,\nthe implementation of this rule could be subject to injunctions and potential reversals,\nleading to significant instability and uncertainty within the civil service. This could\nnecessitate the reinstatement of employees who were previously reclassified and\npotentially terminated, further disrupting government operations. The proposed rule\nand the Executive Order upon which it is based face substantial legal hurdles, with\narguments centered on the exceeding of presidential authority, contravention of the\nCivil Service Reform Act, and potential violations of the Administrative Procedure Act,\ncasting serious doubt on their long-term legal standing and practical implementation.\n6. Negative Impacts on Accountability and Whistleblower Protections: Silencing\nDissent\nCritics have voiced significant concerns that the implementation of Schedule\nPolicy/Career, mirroring the previously proposed Schedule F, could lead to a\nresurgence of a patronage-based system within the government, where political\nloyalty trumps merit and expertise in hiring and retention decisions.3 They also warn\nthat the potential for mass removals of civil servants during transitions of power could\nseverely disrupt essential government services and result in a significant loss of\nvaluable institutional knowledge accumulated over years of dedicated public service.3\nA particularly alarming consequence highlighted by legal experts is the potential loss\nof whistleblower rights for reclassified employees.9 This erosion of protections could\nhave a profoundly chilling effect on civil servants' willingness to report waste, fraud,\nand abuse within their respective agencies, ultimately leading to a less accountable\nand potentially more corrupt government.10 Weaker civil service laws, such as those\nproposed under this rule, inherently undermine whistleblower protections, which are\ncrucial for safeguarding the career federal workforce from retaliation and political\nfavoritism. This weakening of protections would not only make the government less\neffective but also pose risks to the public. Furthermore, it would impede Congress's\nability to conduct effective oversight of the executive branch, as federal employees\nwithin agencies serve as vital sources of information. Without robust protections and\ndue process, these sources would be far less likely to come forward with crucial\ninformation.23 Advocacy organizations have strongly condemned the proposed rule,\nemphasizing that if the administration is permitted to disregard the Constitution and\nthe Civil Service Reform Act, it would effectively eliminate whistleblower protections,\nposing a fundamental threat to democracy. By potentially stripping thousands of\nemployees of their rights to report illegal activities, waste, and abuse, the\nadministration would create an environment where corruption, secrecy, and political\ncronyism could flourish unchecked, leading to a significant decline in good\ngovernance and causing substantial harm to the American people.15 The fear of\narbitrary dismissal, a direct consequence of the diminished job security under this\nrule, could discourage civil servants from reporting any wrongdoing, fostering a less\ntransparent and accountable government. The erosion of whistleblower protections\nwould also weaken the essential checks and balances within the government system,\nmaking it considerably more difficult for both Congress and the public to hold the\nexecutive branch accountable for its actions.11 By diminishing job security and\npotentially undermining critical whistleblower protections, the proposed rule creates a\ndangerous environment where civil servants are less likely to hold the administration\naccountable, significantly increasing the risk of waste, fraud, and abuse within the\nfederal government.\n7. Conclusion: Preserving a Professional and Nonpartisan Civil Service\nIn conclusion, the proposed rule to implement Executive Order 14171 and establish\nSchedule Policy/Career represents a misguided approach that would undermine the\nfundamental principles of the American civil service. The analysis indicates that this\nrule threatens to erode the merit-based system, replacing it with a model susceptible\nto political influence and patronage. It strips away essential due process protections\nand job security for career professionals, potentially leading to a \"brain drain\" and a\nchilling effect on the willingness of civil servants to provide objective advice. The\nincreased politicization of the civil service, a likely outcome of this rule, risks\ndiminishing government effectiveness and potentially leading to the suppression of\nvital scientific and technical information. Furthermore, the legal and statutory\nconcerns surrounding the rule and the underlying Executive Order raise serious\nquestions about their legitimacy and long-term viability. Finally, the potential negative\nimpacts on accountability and whistleblower protections could foster an environment\nwhere waste, fraud, and abuse go unreported and unchecked. A professional,\nnonpartisan civil service, built on merit and dedicated to serving the public interest, is\na cornerstone of a well-functioning democracy.5 The proposed rule represents a\ndangerous step towards a politicized civil service that would ultimately harm the\nAmerican people and undermine the principles of good governance. Therefore, the\nimplementation of this rule should be reconsidered to safeguard the integrity and\neffectiveness of the civil service.\nTable: Comparison of Traditional Civil Service and Proposed Schedule\nPolicy/Career\nFeature Traditional Civil Service Proposed Schedule\nPolicy/Career\nHiring Basis Merit, based on qualifications Potentially based on political\nand competitive examinations loyalty and policy alignment 3\nJob Security Significant protections, \"for Reduced protections,\ncause\" removal 4 potential for \"at-will\"\ntermination 3\nDue Process Comprehensive adverse Limited or no coverage under\naction procedures and appeal standard adverse action\nrights 4 procedures 1\nPolitical Loyalty Not required 1 Implicit requirement to\nfaithfully implement\nadministration policies 1\nWhistleblower Protection Robust protections against Potentially weakened 9\nretaliation 23\nUnion Protections Generally applicable 4 Potentially diminished or\neliminated 4\nWorks cited\n1.

    "comment": "See attached.\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\nI submit this comment in response to OPM\u2019s proposed rule to create \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d\nwithin the excepted service. I urge OPM to withdraw or substantially revise the proposal due to\nthe significant legal, operational, and equity concerns it raises.\n1. \u201cPolicy-Influencing\u201d Must Be More Clearly and Narrowly Defined\nThe proposed rule does not clearly define what constitutes a \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d position. This\nambiguity invites inconsistent application and risks politicizing a wide range of career roles that\nare fundamentally nonpartisan and subject to supervisory oversight. Career civil servants\nimplement policy, but do not set it. They are required to follow the lawful orders of their agency\nleadership and are structurally and legally constrained from independently driving policy\ndecisions.\nOPM should revise the rule to limit \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d designations to positions already\nclassified as political appointments, such as Schedule C or noncareer SES positions, where\npolicymaking authority is explicit and aligned with Presidential direction. Expanding this\ndesignation to cover regular career positions fundamentally misunderstands their role and\nundermines the merit system principles enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301.\n2. The Existing Performance System Works\nContrary to the rationale for the proposed rule, agencies already have effective tools to address\npoor performance through existing processes under chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5. Performance\nImprovement Plans (PIPs), disciplinary actions, and the probationary period provide sufficient\nmeans to remove employees who cannot or will not meet required standards.\nOPM\u2019s own data shows thousands of employees are removed annually for performance or\nconduct\u2014demonstrating that the system works when applied appropriately. Eliminating these\nsafeguards would increase the risk of arbitrary removals and discourage talented individuals\nfrom pursuing or remaining in public service.\n3. The Proposal Imposes Disproportionate Risk Without Additional\nCompensation\nThe proposed rule effectively reclassifies career employees as at-will, akin to political\nappointees or Senior Executive Service (SES) members, by removing their adverse action and\nappeal rights. However, it does so without providing any of the benefits typically afforded to such\npositions, including:\n\u25cf Higher salaries associated with the SES pay scale;\n\u25cf Increased annual leave accrual rates;\n\u25cf Greater agency mobility and career advancement incentives.\nIf OPM intends to impose SES-like accountability standards on career employees, it must also\nrecognize that doing so without commensurate compensation or benefits is fundamentally\ninequitable and demoralizing. The rule strips career employees of their protections while\nproviding none of the advantages that justify those tradeoffs for SES or political personnel.\n4. The Proposal Risks Politicization and Legal Challenges\nBy designating career employees as policy-influencing and removing their due process rights,\nthe rule creates a chilling effect and opens the door to politicized dismissals. This threatens the\nneutrality of the civil service and exposes the government to significant legal risk, including\nconstitutional challenges under the Due Process Clause and potential First Amendment claims\nif dismissals are motivated by perceived political views.\nAdditionally, this rule circumvents the congressional framework of the Civil Service Reform Act\nof 1978, which was enacted to protect against these exact risks. Major changes to the balance\nbetween executive flexibility and employee protections should be made by Congress\u2014not\nthrough executive action alone.\n5. Recommendations\nTo preserve the integrity of the federal workforce and ensure a fair, legally sound approach to\naccountability, I respectfully request that OPM:\n\u25cf Narrowly define \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d roles to cover only political appointees and\nnoncareer SES;\n\u25cf Preserve chapter 43 and 75 protections for all career employees;\n\u25cf Recognize that increased accountability must come with appropriate compensation and\nbenefits;\n\u25cf Extend the comment period to a minimum of 60 days, in accordance with Executive\nOrder 12866, to allow full public participation.\nConclusion\nThe proposed rule mischaracterizes the role of career civil servants, undermines long-standing\nmerit system principles, and imposes inequitable burdens on public employees without\njustification. These changes would weaken the federal workforce, not strengthen it. I strongly\nurge OPM to withdraw this proposal and consider more targeted, collaborative reforms that\nrespect the statutory framework and honor the contributions of the career civil service.\n\n\n",

Introduction: The Perils of Politicizing the Civil Service\nThe proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on April 23, 2025 1, seeks to\nimplement Executive Order 14171 and establish a new personnel category known as\nSchedule Policy/Career within the civil service. The stated aim is to enhance\nperformance, accountability, and responsiveness within the federal workforce.1\nHowever, this initiative, which reinstates and amends the previous Schedule F\nexecutive order 2, presents a significant threat to the foundational principles of a\nmerit-based, nonpartisan civil service. This report argues against the implementation\nof this rule, asserting that it undermines the established merit system, erodes job\nsecurity for dedicated career professionals, risks increased politicization and a decline\nin government effectiveness, raises substantial legal and statutory concerns, and\ncould negatively impact accountability mechanisms, including whistleblower\nprotections. The purported objectives of improved \"performance, accountability, and\nresponsiveness\" appear to be contradicted by the very mechanisms proposed in the\nrule. The focus on \"policy-influencing\" roles, coupled with the removal of critical job\nprotections, suggests an underlying intention to exert greater political control over the\ncivil service rather than a genuine effort to enhance governmental functions.\nFurthermore, the reintroduction of this type of reform, following previous attempts,\nindicates a persistent agenda to fundamentally reshape the civil service in a manner\nthat could lead to instability and a loss of invaluable institutional knowledge with each\nchange in presidential administration.\n2. Undermining Merit-Based Principles: A Return to Patronage\nA cornerstone of the proposed rule is the incorporation of Schedule Policy/Career as\nan excepted service schedule specifically targeting career positions with policy\ninfluence.1 This shift fundamentally challenges the long-standing merit-based\nprinciples that have traditionally governed the selection and retention of civil servants.\nThe establishment of Schedule F, the precursor to Schedule Policy/Career, was\ndesigned to remove competitive examination requirements, potentially paving the way\nfor appointments based on factors other than demonstrated competence and\nexpertise.3 This approach contrasts sharply with the traditional merit-based system,\nwhere recruitment and disciplinary actions are ideally based on qualifications and\nperformance.4 Under the proposed rule, employees in Schedule Policy/Career\npositions could be hired and potentially dismissed at the executive's discretion, raising\nthe specter of political affiliation playing a dominant role in staffing decisions, thereby\nundermining the principle of selecting individuals based on their training and\nexperience.4 Public sentiment overwhelmingly favors a merit-based civil service, with\n95% of Americans believing that hiring and promotion should be based on merit\nrather than political beliefs.5 The proposed rule, therefore, stands in direct opposition\nto the widely held view that competence and qualifications should be the primary\ndeterminants of civil service employment. This deviation from merit-based hiring\npractices carries the risk of diminishing the overall quality and expertise within the\ncivil service. When individuals are selected based on political considerations rather\nthan their skills and qualifications, it can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and a decline in\nthe quality of government programs and services. Such a system could also cultivate a\nculture where political loyalty takes precedence over professional competence,\nincentivizing individuals to prioritize pleasing political superiors over serving the public\ninterest with their best judgment and expertise. The proposed rule thus presents a\ndanger of reverting the civil service system to a patronage model, reminiscent of\nhistorical periods characterized by corruption and a lack of qualified personnel.7\n3. Erosion of Due Process and Job Security: The \"At-Will\" Threat\nA particularly concerning aspect of the proposed rule is the clarification that\nemployees in Schedule C and the newly created Schedule Policy/Career positions will\nnot be covered by the procedural requirements of chapter 75 of Title 5 of the U.S.\nCode, which govern adverse actions and appeals.1 This represents a significant\ndeparture from established civil service protections, stripping a considerable portion\nof the federal workforce of crucial safeguards against unfair dismissal. Under the\nframework of Schedule F, which Schedule Policy/Career effectively reinstates,\npositions would lose the \"for cause\" requirement for removal, meaning that\nemployees could be terminated at will, akin to political appointees, without the need\nfor documented performance or conduct issues.3 Employees reclassified under this\nschedule would forfeit rights traditionally afforded to government employees through\nthe Civil Service Reform Act, including advance notice of disciplinary actions,\nprotection against politically motivated or arbitrary firing, merit-based performance\nstandards, and the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).4\nFurthermore, the proposed rule seeks to amend 5 CFR part 432 to exclude Schedule\nPolicy/Career positions from the performance-based removal procedures outlined in\nchapter 43 of Title 5.1 This further restricts the avenues for appeal and challenges to\ntermination, even in cases where poor performance is alleged. The absence of job\nsecurity and due process protections could trigger a significant exodus of\nexperienced and skilled civil servants seeking more stable employment opportunities\nelsewhere. This \"brain drain\" would further deplete the government's expertise and\ninstitutional knowledge.8 Moreover, the precarious nature of employment under this\nrule could create a chilling effect on civil servants' willingness to offer candid and\nobjective advice, especially if their perspectives diverge from the administration's\npolicies, as they would understandably fear reprisal in the form of dismissal.9 By\neliminating fundamental due process protections, the proposed rule effectively\ntransforms career civil servants in policy-influencing roles into at-will employees,\nthereby undermining the stability and professionalism that are essential for an\neffective civil service.\n4. Increased Politicization and Reduced Government Effectiveness: Loyalty\nOver Expertise\nThe proposed rule explicitly states that while employees in Schedule Policy/Career\npositions are not required to pledge personal loyalty to the President, they must\ndiligently implement the President's policies, with failure to do so constituting grounds\nfor dismissal.1 Despite the disclaimer regarding personal loyalty, the emphasis on\nstrict adherence to the administration's policies and the threat of termination for\nnon-compliance can be interpreted as establishing a de facto loyalty test. Research\nhas consistently demonstrated that a reliance on political appointees and the\npoliticization of the civil service undermine government performance.11 Studies\nconducted during previous administrations have indicated that more politicized\nenvironments within the federal government negatively impact the incentives for\ncareer bureaucrats to invest in their skills, often leading them to seek employment\noutside of government.11 This further corroborates the concern about a potential\n\"brain drain\" and the detrimental effects on skill development and retention within the\ncivil service. The consensus among experts is that politicization generally leads to a\ndecline in government capacity and overall performance.11 Concrete examples\nillustrate the potential for negative consequences, such as government agencies with\na higher number of political appointees being more likely to award government\ncontracts to firms connected to the ruling party, even if those firms do not offer the\nmost cost-effective solutions.12 The emphasis on policy alignment over independent\nexpertise could also lead to the suppression or manipulation of crucial scientific and\ntechnical information if it happens to contradict the administration's political agenda.\nThis could have severe implications for public health and safety in agencies like the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).7\nFurthermore, increased political turnover within the civil service, a likely outcome of\nthe proposed rule, could disrupt the continuity of long-term projects and initiatives\nthat require sustained effort and expertise across multiple administrations. This would\nhinder the government's ability to effectively address complex challenges that\ndemand consistent attention and a long-term perspective.8 By prioritizing the\nimplementation of a specific political agenda over the independent expertise of\ncareer civil servants, the proposed rule risks transforming the civil service into an\ninstrument of partisan objectives, thereby undermining its fundamental purpose of\nserving the public interest based on professional competence and neutrality.\n5. Legal and Statutory Concerns: Exceeding Executive Authority\nThe proposed rule and the underlying Executive Order 14171 have already faced\nsignificant legal challenges. Plaintiffs have argued that the Executive Order is unlawful\nbecause it exceeds the statutory authority granted to the President by Congress and\nruns contrary to congressional intent, particularly as it seeks to reclassify career\nemployees rather than solely political appointees.14 Legal complaints assert that the\nimplementation of Executive Order 14171 would facilitate the dismantling of the civil\nservice and its replacement with political loyalists, thereby violating the Civil Service\nReform Act (CSRA) and infringing upon Congress's constitutional authority to\nestablish and regulate the civil service system to ensure a merit-based federal\nworkforce free from political retribution.15 Lawsuits have also been filed contending\nthat the President has illegally overstepped his authority by attempting to unilaterally\nroll back existing regulations that protect the rights of civil servants.16 The National\nTreasury Employees Union (NTEU) has similarly filed suit to block the implementation\nof Schedule F, arguing that it is \"contrary to congressional intent\" and wrongly applies\nemployment rules intended for political appointees to career staff, deprives federal\nemployees of their promised due process rights, and disregards established Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) regulations.18 The attempt by the OPM to bypass the\ntraditional notice-and-comment rulemaking process for rescinding portions of\nprevious regulations raises further legal concerns regarding transparency and\nadherence to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).20 The OPM's assertion of a\nvague presidential authority to \"nullify\" existing federal rules without following the\nstandard rulemaking procedures mandated by the APA is likely to face legal scrutiny.\nShould the courts ultimately rule against the administration in these legal challenges,\nthe implementation of this rule could be subject to injunctions and potential reversals,\nleading to significant instability and uncertainty within the civil service. This could\nnecessitate the reinstatement of employees who were previously reclassified and\npotentially terminated, further disrupting government operations. The proposed rule\nand the Executive Order upon which it is based face substantial legal hurdles, with\narguments centered on the exceeding of presidential authority, contravention of the\nCivil Service Reform Act, and potential violations of the Administrative Procedure Act,\ncasting serious doubt on their long-term legal standing and practical implementation.\n6. Negative Impacts on Accountability and Whistleblower Protections: Silencing\nDissent\nCritics have voiced significant concerns that the implementation of Schedule\nPolicy/Career, mirroring the previously proposed Schedule F, could lead to a\nresurgence of a patronage-based system within the government, where political\nloyalty trumps merit and expertise in hiring and retention decisions.3 They also warn\nthat the potential for mass removals of civil servants during transitions of power could\nseverely disrupt essential government services and result in a significant loss of\nvaluable institutional knowledge accumulated over years of dedicated public service.3\nA particularly alarming consequence highlighted by legal experts is the potential loss\nof whistleblower rights for reclassified employees.9 This erosion of protections could\nhave a profoundly chilling effect on civil servants' willingness to report waste, fraud,\nand abuse within their respective agencies, ultimately leading to a less accountable\nand potentially more corrupt government.10 Weaker civil service laws, such as those\nproposed under this rule, inherently undermine whistleblower protections, which are\ncrucial for safeguarding the career federal workforce from retaliation and political\nfavoritism. This weakening of protections would not only make the government less\neffective but also pose risks to the public. Furthermore, it would impede Congress's\nability to conduct effective oversight of the executive branch, as federal employees\nwithin agencies serve as vital sources of information. Without robust protections and\ndue process, these sources would be far less likely to come forward with crucial\ninformation.23 Advocacy organizations have strongly condemned the proposed rule,\nemphasizing that if the administration is permitted to disregard the Constitution and\nthe Civil Service Reform Act, it would effectively eliminate whistleblower protections,\nposing a fundamental threat to democracy. By potentially stripping thousands of\nemployees of their rights to report illegal activities, waste, and abuse, the\nadministration would create an environment where corruption, secrecy, and political\ncronyism could flourish unchecked, leading to a significant decline in good\ngovernance and causing substantial harm to the American people.15 The fear of\narbitrary dismissal, a direct consequence of the diminished job security under this\nrule, could discourage civil servants from reporting any wrongdoing, fostering a less\ntransparent and accountable government. The erosion of whistleblower protections\nwould also weaken the essential checks and balances within the government system,\nmaking it considerably more difficult for both Congress and the public to hold the\nexecutive branch accountable for its actions.11 By diminishing job security and\npotentially undermining critical whistleblower protections, the proposed rule creates a\ndangerous environment where civil servants are less likely to hold the administration\naccountable, significantly increasing the risk of waste, fraud, and abuse within the\nfederal government.\n7. Conclusion: Preserving a Professional and Nonpartisan Civil Service\nIn conclusion, the proposed rule to implement Executive Order 14171 and establish\nSchedule Policy/Career represents a misguided approach that would undermine the\nfundamental principles of the American civil service. The analysis indicates that this\nrule threatens to erode the merit-based system, replacing it with a model susceptible\nto political influence and patronage. It strips away essential due process protections\nand job security for career professionals, potentially leading to a \"brain drain\" and a\nchilling effect on the willingness of civil servants to provide objective advice. The\nincreased politicization of the civil service, a likely outcome of this rule, risks\ndiminishing government effectiveness and potentially leading to the suppression of\nvital scientific and technical information. Furthermore, the legal and statutory\nconcerns surrounding the rule and the underlying Executive Order raise serious\nquestions about their legitimacy and long-term viability. Finally, the potential negative\nimpacts on accountability and whistleblower protections could foster an environment\nwhere waste, fraud, and abuse go unreported and unchecked. A professional,\nnonpartisan civil service, built on merit and dedicated to serving the public interest, is\na cornerstone of a well-functioning democracy.5 The proposed rule represents a\ndangerous step towards a politicized civil service that would ultimately harm the\nAmerican people and undermine the principles of good governance. Therefore, the\nimplementation of this rule should be reconsidered to safeguard the integrity and\neffectiveness of the civil service.\nTable: Comparison of Traditional Civil Service and Proposed Schedule\nPolicy/Career\nFeature Traditional Civil Service Proposed Schedule\nPolicy/Career\nHiring Basis Merit, based on qualifications Potentially based on political\nand competitive examinations loyalty and policy alignment 3\nJob Security Significant protections, \"for Reduced protections,\ncause\" removal 4 potential for \"at-will\"\ntermination 3\nDue Process Comprehensive adverse Limited or no coverage under\naction procedures and appeal standard adverse action\nrights 4 procedures 1\nPolitical Loyalty Not required 1 Implicit requirement to\nfaithfully implement\nadministration policies 1\nWhistleblower Protection Robust protections against Potentially weakened 9\nretaliation 23\nUnion Protections Generally applicable 4 Potentially diminished or\neliminated 4\nWorks cited\n1.

    "comment": "Dear Director Ahuja:\n\nI write to raise serious concerns with the cost-benefit analysis accompanying OPM\u2019s proposed rule to establish \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d in the excepted service. While this rule has been designated a \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d under Executive Order 12866, its accompanying cost-benefit analysis does not meet the standards required for such actions. The analysis suffers from speculative assumptions, methodological gaps, and an absence of empirical support for projected benefits.\n\n1. Unbalanced and Speculative Benefit Estimates\nThe proposal suggests that the primary benefits of the rule stem from \"increased accountability\" and faster rulemaking due to improved employee performance. However, OPM acknowledges that it \"does not have a reasonable basis for estimating the magnitude of these gains\" and therefore does not quantify them\u200b. These unquantified benefits are described as likely to \u201cvastly outweigh\u201d any administrative cost savings\u2014yet no data or modeling is presented to support this claim.\n\nWithout empirical evidence or analytical models, these claims of productivity gains, faster regulatory output, or alignment with legal standards are speculative and not measurable. Basing a rule that removes statutory rights from tens of thousands of employees on such unverified assumptions undermines the integrity of the regulatory analysis.\n\n2. Overstated Cost Savings from Appeal Process Elimination\nOPM estimates savings of $13.2 million per year by reducing the time spent on separation and appeals processes under chapters 43 and 75\u200b. However, this figure is based on just 112 hypothetical separations annually\u2014a figure derived from applying a generic 0.25% removal rate to 45,000 employees. This approach fails to account for variation in performance across roles, agencies, and leadership, and it offers no basis for assuming that the entire cohort of affected employees would mirror this removal rate.\n\nMoreover, the estimate assumes every separation would involve an extraordinary amount of administrative time (600 hours per case), including appeals. This assumption likely inflates costs, as many separations do not involve such extensive processes, and many cases are resolved without appeal.\n\n3. Failure to Consider Offset Costs and Risk Shifting\nThe analysis ignores several costs that could arise from the rule:\n\nIncreased EEO complaints: OPM concedes that EEO filings may rise as employees look for alternative remedies when MSPB appeals are foreclosed, but declines to estimate those costs, calling them \u201cspeculative\u201d\u200b.\n\nLoss of experienced personnel: The analysis does not address potential costs from diminished morale, increased attrition, or loss of institutional knowledge as employees seek more secure positions elsewhere.\n\nRecruitment and retention challenges: OPM previously warned that similar proposals would undermine recruitment and retention. The proposed rule dismisses these concerns but offers no new analysis or data to support the reversal of that conclusion\u200b. These omissions distort the net benefits of the rule and understate its potential negative impacts on workforce stability and operational continuity.\n\n4. Absence of Alternatives Analysis\nExecutive Order 12866 requires agencies to consider regulatory alternatives. Here, OPM summarily rejects training-based improvements or other targeted reforms as \u201cnot viable\u201d without offering any comparative cost or effectiveness analysis. This failure to consider less disruptive alternatives, such as enhanced supervisory training or streamlined adverse action procedures, is a significant shortcoming.\n\nConclusion\nThe proposed rule\u2019s economic analysis is insufficient to support the drastic changes it proposes. The benefits are vague, unquantified, and unsupported by data, while cost savings are likely overstated and fail to account for offsetting risks. OPM has not met its obligations under Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 to produce a transparent, evidence-based regulatory impact analysis. I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw the proposal and conduct a more thorough and balanced assessment of costs, benefits, and alternatives before advancing such a consequential change.",
    "original_comment": "Dear Director Ahuja:\n\nI write to raise serious concerns with the cost-benefit analysis accompanying OPM\u2019s proposed rule to establish \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d in the excepted service. While this rule has been designated a \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d under Executive Order 12866, its accompanying cost-benefit analysis does not meet the standards required for such actions. The analysis suffers from speculative assumptions, methodological gaps, and an absence of empirical support for projected benefits.\n\n1. Unbalanced and Speculative Benefit Estimates\nThe proposal suggests that the primary benefits of the rule stem from \"increased accountability\" and faster rulemaking due to improved employee performance. However, OPM acknowledges that it \"does not have a reasonable basis for estimating the magnitude of these gains\" and therefore does not quantify them\u200b. These unquantified benefits are described as likely to \u201cvastly outweigh\u201d any administrative cost savings\u2014yet no data or modeling is presented to support this claim.\n\nWithout empirical evidence or analytical models, these claims of productivity gains, faster regulatory output, or alignment with legal standards are speculative and not measurable. Basing a rule that removes statutory rights from tens of thousands of employees on such unverified assumptions undermines the integrity of the regulatory analysis.\n\n2. Overstated Cost Savings from Appeal Process Elimination\nOPM estimates savings of $13.2 million per year by reducing the time spent on separation and appeals processes under chapters 43 and 75\u200b. However, this figure is based on just 112 hypothetical separations annually\u2014a figure derived from applying a generic 0.25% removal rate to 45,000 employees. This approach fails to account for variation in performance across roles, agencies, and leadership, and it offers no basis for assuming that the entire cohort of affected employees would mirror this removal rate.\n\nMoreover, the estimate assumes every separation would involve an extraordinary amount of administrative time (600 hours per case), including appeals. This assumption likely inflates costs, as many separations do not involve such extensive processes, and many cases are resolved without appeal.\n\n3.

    "comment": "I. Introduction\n\nOn its face, the initiative titled \u201cImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\u201d purports to promote government efficiency. In practice, however, this policy operates as a constitutional wrecking ball\u2014trampling First Amendment rights, undermining due process, violating the separation of powers, and inviting discriminatory enforcement under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThis memo outlines the legal basis for challenging the initiative\u2019s implementation under multiple constitutional frameworks, with a tone just as unapologetic as the initiative\u2019s overreach.\n\nII. First Amendment Violations \u2013 The Silencing of Dissent\n\nThe initiative risks weaponizing performance metrics to suppress political expression, whistleblowing, or union activity. Public employees do not surrender their constitutional rights at the government\u2019s doorstep. Under Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563 (1968), the government cannot discipline employees for speaking out on matters of public concern unless it can prove actual disruption.\n\nIf this initiative permits or encourages:\n\t\u2022\tDisciplining employees for criticizing agency inefficiency,\n\t\u2022\tPenalizing union members for organizing,\n\t\u2022\tRetaliating against whistleblowers,\n\n\u2026it becomes a government-sanctioned gag order.\n\nIII. Due Process Violations \u2013 Firing First, Asking Questions Never\n\nThe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee that no person shall be deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or property\u201d without due process. Long-term federal employees have a protected property interest in their continued employment (Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985)).\n\nThe initiative\u2019s streamlined disciplinary procedures lack:\n\t\u2022\tNotice,\n\t\u2022\tA meaningful opportunity to be heard,\n\t\u2022\tA neutral arbiter,\n\nwhich renders any adverse action unconstitutional. Due process isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s foundational.\n\nIV. Separation of Powers \u2013 The Executive Branch Goes Rogue\n\nThis initiative appears to override statutory protections enacted by Congress under Title 5 of the U.S. Code, which governs federal employment. The President cannot unilaterally rewrite these laws by executive fiat without running afoul of INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), which reaffirmed that core legislative powers cannot be absorbed by the executive branch.\n\nAny attempt to:\n\t\u2022\tAlter hiring/firing rules,\n\t\u2022\tBypass Office of Personnel Management procedures,\n\t\u2022\tReassign authority to political appointees,\n\nis not \u201cefficiency\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a power grab.\n\nV. Equal Protection Violations \u2013 Discrimination Hidden in Metrics\n\nIf the performance criteria used disproportionately impact employees of a certain race, gender, age, or disability status, the initiative opens the door to Equal Protection claims under the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VII.\n\nExample:\n\t\u2022\tA facially neutral metric that penalizes older workers for \u201clack of adaptability\u201d may have a disparate impact under the ADEA (Age Discrimination in Employment Act).\n\nThe government\u2019s data-driven discrimination may wear a lab coat, but it\u2019s still illegal.\n\nVI. Unconstitutional Delegation \u2013 Outsourcing Constitutional Authority\n\nPerformance evaluations delegated to private contractors or AI-driven tools? That\u2019s a delegation of government authority without accountability. This violates the nondelegation doctrine, which demands that critical government decisions be made by accountable, constitutionally appointed officials.\n\nNo AI algorithm gets to fire a public servant without a human being held responsible.\n\nVII. Vagueness & Overbreadth \u2013 Kafka Would Be Proud\n\nTerms like \u201cresponsiveness\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d are so vague they invite arbitrary enforcement. Worse, they chill lawful behavior\u2014an overbreadth problem that courts have historically struck down (Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104 (1972)).\n\nA law so ambiguous that no one knows what conduct will get them fired isn\u2019t a policy\u2014it\u2019s a trap.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\n\nThe \u201cImproving Performance\u201d initiative is not a benign effort at civil service reform. It is a bureaucratic Trojan Horse\u2014a policy riddled with constitutional landmines and authoritarian potential. If challenged, courts will likely find significant portions of the initiative to be in violation of fundamental rights and structural protections enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nReform should not come at the cost of liberty.

    "comment": "Please read this entire comment on the proposed rule titled \u201cImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\u201d (RIN: 3206-AO80, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004).\n\nWhile I support effective performance management, this rule undermines the core values of a professional, nonpartisan, and merit-based civil service. It removes procedural protections from career federal employees in so-called \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d positions and places them in a newly created Schedule Policy/Career\u2014effectively converting them into at-will employees, vulnerable to politically motivated removal without due process.\n\n1. Violation of Merit System Principles and Due Process\n\nStripping due process protections from career employees\u2014who were hired competitively and serve irrespective of political affiliation\u2014violates the merit system principles established by Congress in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301. It also contradicts long-standing bipartisan commitments to protect civil servants from political retaliation and patronage systems. Agencies already have tools to address poor performance and misconduct; this proposal unnecessarily guts essential safeguards. Further, this proposed rule uses ancedotal evidence of a few poor performing/ unprofessional employees to disparage hundreds of thousands of others. The vast majority of civil servants are nonpartisan and successfully implement executive guidance. A few bad apples does not poison the entire civil service\n\n2. Potential Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\n\nThe proposed rule is vulnerable under the APA. Specifically:\n\nIt reverses a recent, well-supported rule (April 2024) without a reasoned explanation or new evidence, violating standards set in FCC v. Fox.\n\nIt fails to demonstrate that current accountability mechanisms are inadequate\u2014relying instead on selectively cited surveys and anecdotal evidence,  making the rule arbitrary and capricious (State Farm).\n\nIt disregards the reliance interests of long-serving employees whose procedural rights are being stripped without analysis, as prohibited in DHS v. Regents.  \n\n3. Financial Burden on Taxpayers\n\nThis rule carries serious fiscal consequences:\n\nLegal costs from inevitable lawsuits filed by employee unions, whistleblowers, and good government groups.\n\nBack pay and damages if removals are reversed by courts or future administrations.\n\nTraining and turnover costs due to the loss of experienced personnel.\n\nDeclining morale and efficiency, which harm agency performance and public trust.\n\nOPM has not published a cost-benefit analysis, which may violate Executive Order 12866 and further weaken this rule under judicial scrutiny.\n\n4. Inevitable Litigation and Instability\n\nNumerous lawsuits will be filed, and similar efforts (like Schedule F) have been blocked or rescinded before. The uncertainty and fear generated by this proposal will harm recruitment, retention, and continuity in government, particularly in critical policy, regulatory, and scientific roles. Further, it will weaken the faith in the U.S. Government as a trusted employer and partner\n\nConclusion\n\nThis rule will not improve accountability\u2014it will politicize the federal workforce, destabilize agencies, and expose the government to years of litigation and unnecessary taxpayer expense. It is inconsistent with democratic values, statutory merit principles, and established law. I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw this proposal and preserve the integrity of the career civil service.",

    "comment": "I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule \u201cImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\u201d (RIN 3206 AO80), which would create a new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d excepted service classification. This proposed rule is deeply troubling for several reasons:\n\n1. Undermining Merit System Principles\nBy reclassifying policy influencing positions as at will roles, this rule eviscerates long standing merit system protections. These positions would no longer be covered by Chapter 75 or 43 of Title 5, eliminating due process rights and appeal protections. Such a change opens the door to politically motivated dismissals, weakening the very fabric of a professional and impartial civil service, which is intended to serve the American people, not transient political agendas.\n\n2. Politicization of the Career Civil Service\nThe proposed rule dangerously blurs the line between career and political appointees. Even if the rule claims to retain \u201cnonpartisan\u201d hiring practices, stripping removal protections from employees in policy roles invites political loyalty tests and punishes career experts for objective disagreement with an administration\u2019s preferred direction. This undermines the institutional knowledge and independent judgment essential for sound governance.\n\n3. Addressing Performance Does Not Require At Will Employment\nThe justification that supervisors struggle to remove underperforming employees is not a reason to eliminate due process. The federal government already has mechanisms to address poor performance and misconduct under current law, with structured, reviewable procedures that protect both agency function and employee rights. The notion that accountability necessitates the removal of appeal rights is not supported by the existing body of evidence or practice.\n\n4. Retreading a Harmful and Rejected Path\nSchedule F, which this rule effectively reinstates under a new name, was previously revoked for good reason. It was widely opposed by federal employees, unions, and good governance experts. Its reintroduction, regardless of nomenclature, raises the same fundamental concerns: it encourages arbitrary terminations, creates instability, and discourages talented individuals from public service.\n\nIn sum, this proposal would fundamentally damage the integrity, independence, and fairness of the US civil service. I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw this rule and preserve the principles of merit based employment and constitutional due process that have long underpinned the effective functioning of the federal workforce.",

By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles.

NEPA Applies to Major Federal Actions With Environmental Implications\nNEPA requires federal agencies to determine whether proposed actions may directly, indirectly,\nor cumulatively affect the human environment. While this rule does not involve land use or\nphysical development, it is a government-wide policy change that could significantly affect how\nfederal agencies carry out their missions\u2014including agencies with direct responsibilities for\nenvironmental protection, resource management, or permitting decisions.\nAs a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, this proposal may qualify as a\nmajor federal action under NEPA, and therefore warrants environmental review, or at a\nminimum, a documented determination of inapplicability.\n2. Potential Environmental Impacts from Workforce Disruption\nThe proposal would allow the President to reclassify career civil servants in \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d\npositions across all executive agencies into an at-will employment status, eliminating their\nprocedural protections under chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5. If broadly implemented, this rule\ncould:\n\u25cf Destabilize staffing in federal agencies tasked with environmental responsibilities (e.g.,\nEPA, Department of the Interior, USDA, NOAA, USFS), leading to:\n\u25cb Loss of technical expertise in environmental assessment, enforcement,\npermitting, and scientific review;\n\u25cb Increased attrition and reduced continuity in project review and interagency\ncoordination;\n\u25cb Delays in the preparation or approval of Environmental Assessments (EAs) and\nEnvironmental Impact Statements (EISs).\n\u25cf Weaken internal oversight and scientific integrity safeguards in environmental\nregulatory programs if subject-matter experts fear politically motivated removal for\ndisagreeing with proposed policy actions, especially in the context of:\n\u25cb Clean air and water permitting decisions;\n\u25cb Endangered species protections;\n\u25cb Federal land and resource management;\n\u25cb Climate-related initiatives.\n\u25cf Create bottlenecks or inconsistencies in NEPA implementation and other statutory\nenvironmental reviews (e.g., under the Clean Water Act, National Historic Preservation\nAct, or National Forest Management Act) if environmental staff are removed or replaced\nwith less qualified personnel.\n3. Examples of Agencies Likely to be Impacted\nThis rule could particularly affect staff in:\n\u25cf The Environmental Protection Agency, including career scientists and enforcement\nofficers responsible for Superfund cleanups, permit decisions, and regulatory analysis;\n\u25cf The Department of the Interior, including the Bureau of Land Management and U.S.\nFish and Wildlife Service employees working on environmental impact statements, land\nuse plans, and endangered species consultations;\n\u25cf The U.S. Forest Service, where environmental planners assess the ecological effects of\nlogging, recreation, fire management, and other land use decisions;\n\u25cf The Department of Energy, where NEPA review plays a central role in the siting and\ndevelopment of energy infrastructure projects.\nThese employees frequently serve in roles that could be interpreted as \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d\nunder the proposed rule\u2014yet they are expected to deliver objective scientific, technical, and\nregulatory determinations. Reclassifying such employees as at-will without the ability to appeal\nadverse actions could have a chilling effect on scientific integrity and undermine environmental\ncompliance efforts.\n4. Request for NEPA Determination\nGiven these potential indirect impacts, I respectfully request that OPM:\n\u25cf Conduct and disclose a NEPA analysis, at minimum in the form of a documented\ncategorical exclusion determination or Environmental Assessment (EA);\n\u25cf Evaluate whether large-scale reclassification of positions across agencies with\nenvironmental responsibilities could significantly affect the human environment within the\nmeaning of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.3 and 1508.1(g);\n\u25cf Consult with relevant agencies\u2014such as EPA, CEQ, DOI, and USDA\u2014to assess\npotential disruptions to environmental compliance programs, especially those relying on\nstable career expertise.\nConclusion\nWhile the proposed rule is administrative in form, it carries the potential for wide-ranging impacts\non how federal agencies administer core environmental laws. By reclassifying civil service\npositions and eliminating procedural protections, OPM risks undermining continuity, scientific\nobjectivity, and legally required environmental reviews across multiple agencies. NEPA\u2019s\nprocedural safeguards exist precisely to identify and address such unintended consequences. A\nthorough NEPA analysis or documented determination of non-applicability is necessary to fulfill\nOPM\u2019s obligations as a federal agency.\n\n\n",

    "comment": "See attached.\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\nDear Director Ahuja:\nI write to express strong opposition to the proposed rule establishing \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d\nwithin the excepted service. In addition to the well-documented violations of the Administrative\nProcedure Act and constitutional concerns, this proposal raises a range of operational, policy,\nand workforce integrity issues that have not been adequately addressed in the rulemaking\nrecord.\n1. Vague Definition of \u201cPolicy-Influencing\u201d\nThe proposed rule does not clearly define what constitutes a \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d position. This\nlack of precision invites inconsistent application across agencies, encourages subjective and\npotentially political decision-making, and could result in the misclassification of technical,\nanalytical, or support roles that do not meaningfully shape policy. Without a clear standard, the\nrule cannot be fairly or predictably implemented.\n2. Absence of Safeguards Against Political Abuse\nBy removing Title 5 protections from select career employees and allowing reclassification at the\ndiscretion of political leadership, the rule creates a pathway to politicize the career workforce.\nThis undermines the long-standing separation between political and career service and\ncontravenes the principles enshrined in the Pendleton Act and Civil Service Reform Act. The\nlack of internal or external checks creates a serious risk of retaliatory or ideologically motivated\nremovals.\n3. Erosion of Whistleblower Protections\nAlthough the rule asserts that whistleblower protections remain intact, the elimination of due\nprocess rights\u2014such as notice, reply, and appeal\u2014will in practice deter employees from\nreporting misconduct. If employees fear that exposing wrongdoing could lead to at-will\ntermination without recourse, the effectiveness of whistleblower laws will be severely\ndiminished. The rule thus has a chilling effect on internal accountability and ethical governance.\n4. Unfunded and Unanalyzed Implementation Burden\nThe proposal will require extensive new classification work, interagency coordination, and White\nHouse involvement in personnel decisions. OPM has not estimated the staffing, cost, or training\nburden associated with these changes, nor has it addressed the challenges smaller agencies\nwill face in meeting these new demands. This implementation burden has been ignored in the\ncost-benefit analysis, distorting the rule\u2019s practical feasibility.\n5. No Transition Plan for Affected Employees\nThe rule does not explain how or when affected employees will be reclassified, whether current\nincumbents will retain existing rights, or how disputes over classification will be handled. This\nlack of a transition plan creates significant legal uncertainty and workforce disruption,\nparticularly for long-serving employees whose job security could change overnight.\n6. Conflicts with Collective Bargaining Agreements\nReclassifying unionized employees without negotiation violates the principles of Chapter 71 of\nTitle 5, governing labor-management relations. The rule does not discuss how it will reconcile\nthis major reorganization with existing collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), raising the\nlikelihood of grievances, arbitration, and litigation.\n7. Damage to Recruitment, Retention, and Diversity Efforts\nThis rule signals that career federal employment is no longer stable or protected from political\ninfluence. That message will discourage talented professionals from joining the public sector,\nparticularly those with options in academia, law, or private industry. It also undermines efforts to\nbuild a workforce that reflects the diversity of the nation by making public service less appealing\nto historically underrepresented groups who often value job security and procedural fairness.\n8. Potential International Consequences\nIn regulatory and scientific agencies, U.S. civil servants routinely engage with foreign\ncounterparts to implement treaties, harmonize safety standards, and uphold international\nobligations. Politicizing technical and policy liaison roles risks weakening international\nconfidence in the neutrality and professionalism of the U.S. civil service. This could have ripple\neffects in areas like trade, food safety, public health, and environmental protection.\nConclusion\nThe proposed rule is more than a classification adjustment\u2014it is a fundamental reordering of\nthe relationship between career employees and political leadership. It creates operational\nchaos, legal uncertainty, and lasting damage to the credibility of the civil service. I urge OPM to\nwithdraw this rule and instead work with agencies, Congress, and the public to pursue targeted,\ndata-driven reforms that uphold accountability while preserving the integrity of the federal\nworkforce.\n\n\n",

The proposal\nto establish a new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d in the excepted service violates multiple provisions\nof the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 et seq., and fails to satisfy the\nminimum standards for lawful rulemaking. The APA imposes essential procedural and\nsubstantive constraints on federal agencies, and this proposal falls short on both fronts.\n1. Failure to Provide a Reasoned Explanation for Policy Reversal\nUnder FCC v. Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. 502 (2009), an agency must provide a\n\u201creasoned explanation\u201d when reversing existing policy, especially when the prior policy relied on\nfactual findings or legal interpretations. The April 2024 final rule concluded\u2014based on record\nevidence\u2014that classifying policy roles as at-will would undermine recruitment, retention, and the\napolitical nature of the civil service. It affirmed the importance of preserving Title 5 protections\nfor all career employees.\nIn contrast, the current proposal simply asserts a preference for increased accountability and\ndismisses prior findings as less aligned with Executive Order 14171. This reversal lacks:\n\u25cf New empirical evidence or data to support the change;\n\u25cf A meaningful engagement with the rationale behind the prior rule;\n\u25cf An acknowledgment of the serious reliance interests of employees affected by the 2024\nrule.\nThe Supreme Court in Fox emphasized that when an agency changes course, it must show that\nthe new policy is permissible, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it\nto be better. That standard has not been met here.\n2. Arbitrary and Capricious Decision making (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A))\nAn agency action is arbitrary and capricious if it:\n\u25cf Relies on factors which Congress did not intend it to consider,\n\u25cf Fails to consider an important aspect of the problem,\n\u25cf Offers an explanation that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or\n\u25cf Is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or agency expertise.\nThe proposed rule suffers from several of these flaws:\n\u25cf It fails to define \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d positions with any precision, leaving excessive\ndiscretion to agencies and the President to remove protections from an undefined group\nof employees.\n\u25cf It does not analyze the operational, legal, or constitutional consequences of eliminating\nprocedural protections from a broad segment of the workforce.\n\u25cf It offers only speculative benefits while dismissing potential harms\u2014such as chilled\nspeech, politicization of expert roles, and decreased retention\u2014without meaningful\nanalysis.\n\u25cf It treats career civil servants as at-will employees without assessing how that decision\naligns with merit system principles codified in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301.\nThis shallow and conclusory reasoning renders the rule vulnerable to invalidation under APA\nstandards.\n3. Failure to Provide a Sufficient Opportunity for Public Comment (5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 553)\nThe APA requires agencies to provide interested parties with a meaningful opportunity to\ncomment on proposed rules. Executive Order 12866 further recommends a 60-day comment\nperiod for significant regulatory actions to ensure robust public participation.\nDespite this being a significant rule with constitutional and workforce-wide implications, OPM\nhas only offered a 30-day comment period. No justification is provided for this abbreviated\ntimeline, even though the rule reverses a final policy adopted just one year ago and affects due\nprocess rights for tens of thousands of federal employees.\nThe limited timeframe has impaired the ability of stakeholders\u2014including employees, unions,\nlegal experts, and agency officials\u2014to fully evaluate the proposal\u2019s impact and respond with\ndetailed comments and evidence.\n4. Improper Delegation of Regulatory Authority to the President\nThe APA requires that rules be issued by the agency with authority under law\u2014not unilaterally\nby the President. This rule proposes that the President\u2014not OPM\u2014will determine which\npositions are placed in Schedule Policy/Career via executive order.\nThis is not a lawful delegation of agency rulemaking. The President is not an agency under the\nAPA and is not authorized to make final, binding determinations in place of the agency in the\nabsence of statutory authorization. By outsourcing key classification decisions to the President,\nOPM improperly circumvents the APA\u2019s procedural safeguards and insulates decisions from\njudicial review.\nConclusion\nThis proposed rule violates the APA by:\n\u25cf Failing to provide a reasoned explanation for reversing prior policy;\n\u25cf Engaging in arbitrary and capricious decision-making;\n\u25cf Curtailing the public's opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process;\n\u25cf Improperly transferring rulemaking authority to the President.\nI respectfully urge OPM to withdraw this proposal and reconsider any changes to the civil\nservice system through lawful, transparent, and evidence-based processes in accordance with\nthe APA.\n\n\n",

    "comment": "Schedule F represents a direct attack on the foundations of democracy by dismantling the system of checks and balances that ensures government works for the people, not for political elites. At the core of a functioning democracy is the principle that public servants\u2014especially those in key policy roles\u2014should be committed to serving the public good, independent of partisan influence. The civil service was designed to insulate government functions from political whims, enabling the fair implementation of laws and policies regardless of the administration in power.\n\nBy allowing vast numbers of career civil servants to be reclassified as political appointees, Schedule F undermines that essential separation. It creates a government where expertise, competence, and institutional knowledge are secondary to political loyalty. Rather than being a voice of reason and a safeguard against power being abused, civil servants would become pawns of the ruling party, compromised in their ability to speak truth to power or enforce the law impartially.\n\nThis erosion of the civil service threatens the very essence of democratic governance. When a government is staffed with individuals loyal to the party in power rather than to the Constitution and the law, the principles of fairness, equality, and accountability begin to unravel. The public no longer has confidence that laws will be executed objectively or that the government will act in the best interest of all citizens, not just those aligned with the ruling administration.\n\nIn a true democracy, the government exists to serve the people, not the interests of those in office. Schedule F, by politicizing the civil service, places partisan advantage over the needs of the nation, undermining the ability of citizens to hold their government accountable. This shift toward a more autocratic system not only weakens the foundations of democracy but also sets a dangerous precedent for future administrations to consolidate power at the expense of the rule of law and public trust.\n\nUltimately, Schedule F risks turning democratic government into a tool for maintaining the status and power of the few, rather than serving the rights and interests of all. This is not just a bad policy\u2014it is a direct challenge to the democratic principles that ensure government remains a servant of the people, not their ruler.",

The new rule shares the same fundamental objective: to remove due process protections from career civil servants.  This structure is inconsistent with the values and protections established under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was designed to prevent the return of a patronage system and protect the merit-based, apolitical structure of the federal workforce. Although the proposed ruling states \u201cPatronage Remains Prohibited\u201d; without due process there is no practical way for employees, the public or oversight bodies to verify that dismissals are not politically motivated. Simply asserting that patronage is prohibited offers little comfort when the system removes the very mechanism that would reveal whether such misconduct has occurred. \n\nThe proposal claims the appointment will remain \u201cnonpartisan\u201d yet it simultaneously strips away the procedural safeguards that shield career employees from politically motivated removals. That contradiction is troubling. This erodes public trust, institutional memory and continuity in government. \n\nThe justification for this rule rests heavily on the claim that it is too difficult to discipline or remove poor performers.  While the removal processes under Chapter 43 and 75 of Title 5 does require time and diligence, it exists to ensure fairness, consistency, and protection for arbitrary actions. The proposed rule manipulates public frustration with government inefficiency by using \u201cpoor performance\u201d as a convenient scapegoat-framing the issue in emotionally charged terms to justify sweeping changes. It appeals to a desire for accountability while concealing a far more troubling goal: enabling the dismissal of career professionals who are not politically aligned with the administration. By dismantling due process protections under the guise of performance reform, the rule risks transforming the civil service from a neutral, merit-based institution into one driven by political loyalty.  \n\nThis rule is unnecessary, potentially unlawful, and fundamentally misaligned with the principals of a professional, nonpartisan civil service. Moreover, eliminating procedural safeguards creates serious risk for whistleblower retaliation, especially for employees who raise concerns about waste, fraud, abuse or illegal directives.  \n\nI respectfully ask OPM to withdraw this proposed rule in full. \n",

Today, the WGS 84 reflects a family of models, parameters, and a\nnew reference frame update.\nThis standard will address the following subject areas with the WGS 84:\n\uf0b7 Coordinate Systems\n\uf0b7 The use of Global Positioning System (GPS) in the development of the WGS\n84 Reference Frame\n\uf0b7 Ellipsoid and its defining parameters\n\uf0b7 Ellipsoidal Gravity formula\n\uf0b7 Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008)\n\uf0b7 EGM2008 Geoid Model\n\uf0b7 The World Magnetic Model (WMM)\n\uf0b7 WGS 84 relationships with other Geodetic Systems\n\uf0b7 Accuracy of WGS 84 and its models\n\uf0b7 Implementation Guidelines\nFor those first time readers, the data, models, and information contained in this\nstandard will address issues and analysis related to the following topical areas:\n\uf0b7 Gravity Field determination and related issues\no Components of the Gravity Field\no Level Surfaces and Plumb Lines\no Spherical Harmonic Expansion of the Gravitational Potential\n\uf0b7 Geodetic Reference Systems and other Reference Frames\no Geocentric Coordinate Systems and Polar Motion\no Astronomic Coordinates and the Global Cartesian Coordinate System\no Reference Surfaces\no Normal Gravity Field\no Satellite Observation and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)\n\uf0b7 Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) activities\no WMM\no EGM2008\no Reference Frame\no GPS\no Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP)\no Use of IERS models and constants\n\uf0b7 Mapping and Charting\no Horizontal Datum\no Vertical Datum\nv\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n\uf0b7 Geodetic, GIS Data, and Other High-Accuracy Applications:\no Reference Frame\no Coordinates\no Earth Gravitational Model (EGM)\no WGS 84 Geoid\no Temporal considerations\nNGA.STND.0036 provides a description and sufficient details regarding the\nglobal World Geodetic System\u2019s global reference frame to allow users of this information\nto implement this reference frame and its associated geophysical models and constants.\nToday\u2019s modern GNSS\u2019s, such as GPS, have made it possible to establish a truly\nglobal geocentric reference system which can be quickly adapted for precise geodetic\npositioning, especially over long distances. It is possible to determine distortions and\nmis-orientations of classical geodetic networks around the world. The entire WGS is\nbeing incorporated into a Standards-based environment through the NGA Geospatial\nIntelligence Standards Working Group (GWG). The result will be that the WGS 84 and\nits future instantiations will become part of the DoD Information Standards Registry\n(DISR) thereby increasing interoperability and reducing acquisition costs.\nReaders will note NGA is adopting multiple recommendations outlined in the\nInternational Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) Technical Note No.\n36, IERS Conventions 2010 (hereafter referred to as IERS TN 36). This NGA Standard\nsupplements IERS TN 36 as DoD guidance for implementation, particularly where WGS\n84 differs from IERS TN 36. A new realization of the WGS 84 reference frame tied to\nIERS TN 36 and the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) 2008, was\nestablished in 2013.\nIn mid-2015, a new edition of this Standard, incorporating an updated WGS 84\nreference frame and an updated WMM 2015 will be written and propagated to the\ncommunity. This anticipated edition will begin a five-year update cycle of the Standard\nand its related models as required. The 2020 update may be a rigorous review of the\nWGS which may result in refining parameters for the WGS.\nvi\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPAGE\nSUBJECT TERMS .......................................................................................................... ii\nNGA DEFINITION ........................................................................................................ iii\nPREFACE ....................................................................................................................... iv\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY ............................................................................................ vi\nTABLE OF CONTENTS ............................................................................................... vii\n1.

INTRODUCTION\nThe National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) supports a large number and variety\nof products and users, which makes it imperative that these products all be related to a common\nworldwide geodetic reference system. This ensures interoperability in relating information from\none product to another, supports increasingly stringent accuracy requirements, and supports\nmilitary and humanitarian activities worldwide. The refined World Geodetic System 1984\n(WGS 84) represents NGA\u2019s best geodetic model of the Earth using data, techniques and\ntechnology available through 2013.\nThe definition of the World Geodetic System has evolved within NGA and its\npredecessor agencies from the initial WGS 60 through subsequent improvements embodied in\nWGS 66, WGS 72, and WGS 84. The refinement described in this standard has been possible\ndue to improved scientific models and additional global data. These data include those from\nprecise and accurate geodetic positioning, new observations of land gravity data, the availability\nof extensive altimetry data, and gravity data from the GRACE satellite mission.\nUsing these data, an improved Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008) and its\nassociated geoid were developed, and the World Magnetic Model 2010 (WMM2010) was\nproduced. EGM2008 was developed by NGA with contracted support. WMM2010 was\ndeveloped jointly by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s\nNational Geophysical Data Center and the British Geological Survey.\nCommensurate with these modeling enhancements, significant improvements in the\ncurrent realization of the WGS 84 reference frame have also been achieved through the\ncontinued improvement of the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS). WGS 84 is\nrealized by the coordinates assigned to the GPS tracking stations used in the calculation of\nprecise GPS orbits at NGA. NGA currently utilizes the six globally dispersed Air Force\noperational GPS tracking stations augmented by eleven tracking stations operated by NGA. The\ncoordinates of these tracking stations have been determined to an absolute accuracy of \uf0b11 cm\n(1\uf073). WGS 84 coordinates are determined primarily through GPS positioning.\nThe WGS 84 represents the best global geodetic reference system for the Earth available\nat this time for practical applications of mapping, charting, geopositioning, and navigation. This\nstandard includes the definition of the coordinate system, fundamental and derived constants, the\nEGM2008, the ellipsoidal (normal) gravity model, a description of the associated WMM, and a\ncurrent list of local datum transformations. NGA recommendations regarding the implementation\nof WGS 84 are given in Chapter Ten of this standard.\n1-1\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n2. WGS 84 COORDINATE SYSTEM\n2.1 Definition\nThe WGS 84 Coordinate System is a Conventional Terrestrial Reference System\n(CTRS). The definition of this coordinate system follows the criteria outlined in International\nEarth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) Technical Note No. 36, IERS\nConventions 2010 (IERS TN 36) [1]. These criteria are repeated below:\n\uf0b7 It is geocentric, the center of mass being defined for the whole Earth including oceans\nand atmosphere\n\uf0b7 Its scale is that of the local Earth frame, in the meaning of a relativistic theory of\ngravitation\n\uf0b7 Its orientation was initially given by the Bureau International de l\u2019Heure (BIH)\norientation of 1984.0\n\uf0b7 Its time evolution in orientation will create no residual global rotation with regards to\nthe crust\nThe WGS 84 Coordinate System is a right-handed, Earth-fixed orthogonal\ncoordinate system and is graphically depicted in Figure 2.1.\nIERS Reference Pole (IRP)\nZ\nWGS 84\nEarth's Center\nof Mass\nIERS\nReference\nMeridian\n(IRM)\nX Y\nWGS 84 WGS 84\nFigure 2.1 The WGS 84 Coordinate System Definition\n2-1\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nIn Figure 2.1, the origin and axes are defined as follows:\nOrigin = Earth\u2019s center of mass\nZ-Axis = The direction of the IERS Reference Pole (IRP). This direction\ncorresponds to the direction of the BIH Conventional Terrestrial Pole (CTP)\n(epoch 1984.0) with an uncertainty of 0.005\uf0b2 [1]\nX-Axis = Intersection of the IERS Reference Meridian (IRM) and the plane\npassing through the origin and normal to the Z-axis. The IRM is coincident with\nthe BIH Zero Meridian (epoch 1984.0) with an uncertainty of 0.005\uf0b2 [1]\nY-Axis = Completes a right-handed, Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF)\northogonal coordinate system\nThe WGS 84 Coordinate System origin also serves as the geometric center of the\nWGS 84 Ellipsoid, and the Z-axis serves as the rotational axis of this ellipsoid of revolution.\nThe definition of the WGS 84 CTRS has not changed in any fundamental way\nsince its original implementation. This CTRS continues to be defined as a right-handed,\northogonal, and Earth-fixed coordinate system which is intended to be as closely coincident as\npossible with the CTRS defined by the IERS or, prior to 1988, its predecessor, the Bureau\nInternational de l\u2019Heure (BIH).\nThe Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) generates the\nsoftware which NGA uses for precise GPS orbits and WGS 84 coordinate solutions. To maintain\nWGS 84 to the highest level of accuracy and integrity, NGA and NSWCDD assess international\nscientific standards to determine their applicability to WGS 84. WGS 84 (G1762) adheres to\nIERS TN 36 with limited exceptions as identified in this document. Note that IERS TN 36 often\ngives multiple approaches for implementation of models. Specifically, WGS 84 (G1762) will not\ninclude pole corrections and will not include librations in UT1 and polar motion defined in IERS\nTN 36 Section 5.5. Previous iterations of WGS 84 (i.e. G1150) are consistent with IERS\nConventions 1996 Technical Note No. 21 [2]. As new standards are adopted, NGA will review\nthem to determine appropriate implementation. WGS 84 may not conform strictly to all\nconventions, but relevant differences will be documented.\n2.2 Realization\nIt is important to understand the definition of a coordinate system and the\npractical realization of a reference frame. Section 2.1 contains the definition of the WGS 84\nCoordinate System. To achieve a practical realization of a global geodetic reference frame, a set\nof station coordinates must be established. A consistent set of station coordinates infers the\nlocation of an origin, the orientation of an orthogonal set of Cartesian axes, and a scale. In\nmodern terms, a globally distributed set of consistent station coordinates on the surface of the\nEarth represents a realization of an ECEF Terrestrial Reference Frame (TRF).\n2-2\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nThe original WGS 84 reference frame was established in 1987 using the Navy\nNavigation Satellite System (also called TRANSIT) [3]. The main objective in the original\neffort was to align, as closely as possible, the origin, scale and orientation of the WGS 84 frame\nwith the BIH Terrestrial System (BTS) frame at an epoch of 1984.0. This development is given\nin DMA TR 8350.2, Editions 1 and 2. Initial uncertainties, in 1987, were 1-2 meters with respect\nto the BTS.\nSince that time, NGA has used the combined network of the US Air Force\n(USAF) and NGA GPS satellite tracking stations to improve the WGS 84 reference frame. The\nWGS 84 reference frame and the GPS Monitor Stations are inherently intertwined. WGS 84 is\nthe reference frame adopted for the operation of GPS, and all users obtain WGS 84 coordinates\nwhen they use the GPS Broadcast Navigation Messages. NGA generates a set of \u2018precise\u2019\nephemerides which adopt the WGS 84, and these ephemerides are used for precise positioning.\nThis includes calculation of the WGS 84 positions of the permanent DoD GPS Monitor Stations\nfor both the US Air Force (USAF) and NGA (Figure 2.2) and, therefore, the WGS 84 origin. For\nhighest accuracy applications such as precise positioning applications, temporal effects should be\nconsidered as described in Section 2.2.4.\nFigure 2.2 WGS 84 (G1762) Reference Frame Stations\nNGA is committed to maintaining the highest possible accuracy and stability for\nthe WGS 84 Reference Frame while remaining both practical and accessible. To do so, NGA has\ngenerated several realizations of WGS 84 incorporating improved data and advances in\ngeophysical modeling to adequately represent the motion of the Earth\u2019s surface. These\nrealizations have not affected the fundamental definition of the WGS 84 reference system; but\nare necessary for high-accuracy, high-integrity applications. The current realization of the WGS\n84 Reference Frame is designated as WGS 84 (G1762). The GPS Operational Control Segment\n(OCS) implemented WGS 84 (G1762) on 16 Oct 2013 with NGA implementation on the same\ndate.\n2-3\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nWGS 84 (G1762) is the sixth update to the realization of the WGS 84 Reference\nFrame. The previous realizations were designated WGS 84 (G1674) [5], WGS 84 (G1150) [4],\nWGS 84 (G873), WGS 84 (G730) and WGS 84. The \u201cG\u201d indicates that GPS measurements were\nused to obtain the coordinates. The number following the \u201cG\u201d indicates the GPS week number\nduring which the coordinates were approved for implementation by NGA. The original\nTRANSIT realization of WGS 84 has no such designation. Detailed documentation of the\nprevious iterations can be found in the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA)\nTR8350.2, Edition 3, (3 Jan 2000) with its Addendum (2002). Table 2.1 shows the name,\nimplementation date by the GPS OCS, epoch, and the overall absolute accuracy of each\nrealization.\nTable 2.1 WGS 84 Station Coordinate Updates\nImplementation date\nGPS\nName NGA Precise Epoch Accuracy\nBroadcast\nEphemeris\nOrbits\nWGS 84 1987 1 Jan 1987 1-2 meters\nWGS 84 (G730) 29 Jun 1994 2 Jan 1994 1994.0 10 cm/component rms\nWGS 84 (G873) 29 Jan 1997 29 Sep 1996 1997.0 5 cm/component rms\nWGS 84 (G1150) 20 Jan 2002 20 Jan 2002 2001.0 1cm/component rms\nWGS 84 (G1674) 8 Feb 2012 7 May 2012 2005.0  0, they have the\nsame sign as the geodetic latitude for point P. For h = 0, the angles \uf061 and \u03b8 are equal and \uf065 = 0.\nNumerical results have indicated that the angular separation (\u03b5) between the component \u03b3 h and\nthe total normal gravity vector\n\u2192\u03b3\nsatisfies the inequality | \u03b5 | < 4 arcseconds for geodetic\ntotal\nheights up to 20,000 meters. For completeness the component ( of the total normal gravity\nvector \u2192\u03b3 total at point P in Figure 4.2 that is orthogonal to \u03b3 h and lies in the meridian plane for\npoint P is given by the expression:\n(4-23)\nThe component has a positive sense northward. For geodetic height h = 0, the\ncomponent is zero. Numerical tests with whole degree latitudes showed that the magnitude of\nremains less than 0.002% of the value of \u03b3 h for geodetic heights up to 20,000 meters.\nEquations (4-16) and (4-23) provide an alternative way to compute the magnitude |\n\u2192\u03b3\n| of the\ntotal\ntotal normal gravity vector through the equation:\n| \u20d7 | \u221a (4-24)\nIn summary, for near-surface geodetic heights when sub-microgal precision is not\nnecessary, the Taylor series expansion Equation (4-3) for \u03b3 h should suffice. When the intended\napplication for \u03b3 h requires high accuracy, Equation (4-4) will be a close approximation to the\nexact Equation (4-16) for geodetic heights up to 20,000 meters. Of course, \u03b3 h can be computed\nusing the exact Equation (4-16), but this requires that the computational procedure include the\ntwo transformations, R1 and R2, that are shown in Equation (4-17). Because the difference in\nresults between Equations (4-4) and (4-16) is less than one microgal (10-6 gal) for geodetic\nheights up to 20,000 meters, the transformation approach would probably be unnecessary in most\nsituations. For applications requiring pure attraction (attraction without centrifugal force) due to\nthe normal gravitational potential (V), the u- and \uf062-vector components of normal gravitation can\nbe computed easily in the ellipsoidal coordinate system by omitting the last term in Equations (4-\n4-6\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n5) and (4-6), respectively. These last attraction terms account for the centrifugal force due to the\nangular velocity (\uf077) of the reference ellipsoid.\nP\n\u03b3\n\u03d5\nZ \u03b3\nP \u03c8\n(\u03bb, \u03d5, h) \u03f4 \u03b8\n\u03b1\n\u03b5\n\u03b3\nr \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3 h \u03b3 r\u22a5 \u03c8\nr total\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\nh h\u22a5 \u03d5\nInset \u2220\u03f4\u03b8 =\u2220\u03b1+\u2220\u03b5\nP\n0\nY\nC \u03c8\n\u03bb \u03d5 z\nP\nx\nP\ny\nP\nX\n\u03bb= geodetic longitude of P C = center of ellipsoid\n\u03c8= geocentric latitude of P x P , y P , z P = 3D Cartesian coordinates of P\n\u03d5= geodetic latitude of P \u03b3 r = normal gravity component along the geocentric radius\nh = geodetic height \u03b3 h = normal gravity component along the geodetic normal\n(\u03bb, \u03c6, h) geodetic coordinates: longitude, latitude, and height\n(\u03bb, \u03b2, u) ellipsoidal coordinates: longitude, reduced latitude, and ellipsoidal parameter\n(x, y, z) 3D Cartesian coordinates: aligned with the ellipsoids\u2019 axes\nFigure 4.2 Normal Gravity Components\n4-7\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n5. WGS 84 EGM2008 GRAVITATIONAL MODELING\n5.1 EGM2008\nThe form of the WGS 84 EGM2008 gravitational model is a spherical harmonic\nexpansion of the gravitational potential (V). The WGS 84 EGM2008 is complete up to degree\n(n) and order (m) 2159, and contains additional spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree\n2190 and order 2159. EGM2008 contains approximately 4.7 million spherical harmonic\ncoefficients. Table 5.1 lists the low degree portion of EGM2008, up to degree and order 18.\nEGM2008 [20] was developed through a least-squares combination of the\nITG-Grace03s [21] satellite-only model, with the gravitational information obtained from the\nanalysis of a global set of 5\uf0a2 x 5\uf0a2 area-mean values of gravity anomalies. The ITG-Grace03s\nmodel was developed by analyzing range-rate data from the GRACE Satellite-to-Satellite\nTracking (SST) mission [22], spanning 57 months. No other satellite data were used in the\ndevelopment of ITG-Grace03s. The global set of 5\uf0a2 x 5\uf0a2 area-mean values of gravity anomalies\nwas formed by merging terrestrial, airborne, and altimetry-derived gravity data. Over some\nareas, the available terrestrial data were proprietary and could only be used up to the 15\uf0a2 x 15\uf0a2\nresolution, which corresponds to harmonic degree 720. To compensate for this restriction, the\ngravitational signal implied by the Earth\u2019s topography, in the form of Residual Terrain Model\neffect [23], was used to supplement the spectral bandwidth of the proprietary data. This\napproach was first tested and verified through comparisons over areas where the full bandwidth\nof the data is available (see [24] for details). Post-production analysis has shown that EGM2008\nincorporated the proprietary gravity data information up to maximum harmonic degree 900\nwhich corresponds approximately to 12 arc-minute resolution. The topographic information that\nwas used within the development of EGM2008 originates from the global Digital Topographic\nModel (DTM) DTM2006.0 [24]. In DTM2006.0, more than 80% of the total land area of the\nEarth is covered with data acquired by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) [25].\nEGM2008 was originally developed in ellipsoidal harmonic coefficients,\ncomplete to degree and order 2159. The conversion from ellipsoidal to spherical harmonic\ncoefficients preserves the order, but not the degree (see [26] for details). For this reason,\nEGM2008 in its final, spherical harmonic form, extends beyond degree 2159, and up to degree\n2190. The extra coefficients are necessary to preserve the modeling fidelity of the expansion,\nespecially at high latitudes. The user need not be concerned with ellipsoidal harmonic\ncoefficients, which represent an intermediate step towards the development of the EGM2008\nspherical harmonic expansion.\nThe sensitivity of an Earth-orbiting satellite to the gravitational potential is\nstrongly influenced by the satellite\u2019s altitude range and other orbital parameters. For satellites\nlike Starlette, LAGEOS, and the GPS spacecraft (with orbit radii of 7331 km, 12270 km, and\n26600 km, respectively) the approximate maximum degree is 90, 20, and 18, respectively.\nHowever, DoD programs performing satellite orbit determinations are advised to determine the\nmaximum degree and order that is most appropriate for their particular mission and orbit\naccuracy requirements and to use the previous estimates only as general guidelines.\n5-1\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nThe WGS 84 EGM2008 coefficients through degree and order 18 are provided in\nTable 5.1 in fully-normalized form. Coefficient error estimates are available for the entire model\nup to degree 2190 and order 2159. In addition, global 5\uf0a2 x 5\uf0a2 grids containing the EGM2008\ncommission error estimates in gravity anomalies, geoid undulations, and in the north-south, east-\nwest (\uf078,\uf068) components of the deflection of the vertical, are available at the NGA web site at:\nhttp://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/index.html\nThe gravity anomaly degree variances implied by EGM2008 up to degree and order 2159 are\nplotted in Figure 5.1.\n5.2 Gravity Potential (W)\nThe Earth\u2019s total gravity potential (W) is defined as\n(5-1)\nwhere V is the gravitational potential and is the potential due to the Earth\u2019s rotation.

WGS 84 EGM2008 GEOID\n6.1 General\nIn geodetic applications, three primary reference surfaces for the Earth are used:\n1) the Earth\u2019s topographic surface, 2) an ellipsoid of revolution, which is a reference surface of\npurely mathematical nature, and 3) the geoid.\nThe locus of points (X, Y, Z) at which the gravity potential (W) maintains a\nconstant value, as shown in Equation (6-1), defines an equipotential surface called a geop [18].\nThere is an infinite number of geops associated with the Earth\u2019s gravity field. Each one of these\ncan be defined by changing the numerical value of the constant in Equation (6-1). The geoid is\nthat particular geop that is closely associated with the mean ocean surface.\n( ) (6-1)\nTraditionally, when a geoid model is developed, the value of the constant in\nEquation (6-1), representing the potential anywhere on this surface, is constrained or assumed to\nbe equal to the normal potential (U ) on the surface of a \u2018best-fitting\u2019 ellipsoid. Throughout this\n0\nrefinement effort, however, the authors recognize that the WGS 84 ellipsoid no longer represents\na true \u2018best-fitting\u2019 ellipsoid. In terms of the geoid, this effect is handled through the application\nof a zero-degree undulation (N ). With this approach, the WGS 84 ellipsoid and its associated\n0\nnormal gravity field can be retained, without the introduction of any additional errors by not\nusing the \u2018best-fitting\u2019 ellipsoid.\nIn common practice, the geoid is expressed at a given point in terms of the\ndistance above (+N) or below (-N) the ellipsoid. For practical reasons, the geoid has been used\nto serve as a vertical reference surface for Mean Sea Level (MSL) heights. In areas where\nelevation data are not available from conventional geodetic leveling, an approximation of MSL\nheights, using orthometric heights, can be obtained from the following equation [18]:\n(6-2)\nwhere\n( )\n( ) ( )\nUtilization of orthometric heights requires knowledge of crustal mass densities.\nLack of such information introduces errors to the geoid undulation model. As an alternative,\nsome countries replace orthometric heights with normal heights and geoid undulations with\nheight anomalies [18]. This use of height anomalies eliminates assumptions about the density of\nmasses between the geoid and the ground. Therefore, Equation (6-2) can be re-formulated as\n6-1\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n(6-3)\nwhere\nThe telluroid [38] is a surface defined in such way that the normal potential (U) at\nevery point Q on the telluroid is equal to the actual potential (W) at its corresponding point P on\nthe Earth\u2019s surface [18]. Point Q is located on the line normal to the ellipsoid that passes through\nP. The height anomaly is the distance between point Q on the telluroid and point P on the\nEarth\u2019s surface.\nEquation (6-2) illustrates the use of geoid undulations in the determination of\northometric heights (H) from geodetic heights (h) derived using satellite positioning (e.g., from\nGPS) located on the Earth\u2019s physical surface or aboard a vehicle operating near the Earth\u2019s\nsurface.\n6.2 Formulas, Representations and Analysis\nThe WGS 84 EGM2008 geoid undulations were computed following the same\ngeneral procedure as in the case of the EGM96 geoid undulations [18]. The difference is that in\nthe case of EGM2008 [20] the expansion in Equation (6-4) extends to degree and order 2190,\nwhile in the case of EGM96, it extended only to degree and order 360. Using the EGM2008\nspherical harmonic coefficients in Equation (6-4), height anomalies are first computed with\nrespect to an \u2018ideal\u2019 (best-fitting) mean-Earth ellipsoid, in the tide-free system. According to\n[28], the best estimates of the parameters of the \u2018ideal\u2019 mean-Earth ellipsoid, in the tide-free\nsystem (Love number k = 0.3), are: semi-major axis a = 6378136.58 meters and reciprocal\nflattening 1/f = 298.257686. The height anomalies are then transformed to geoid undulations\nusing the procedure described in [27] and [29], and a set of correction coefficients complete up\nto degree and order 2160. Finally, the constant value of -0.41 meters is added to these geoid\nundulations. This is the zero-degree height anomaly (\u03b6 ) that accounts for the difference between\nz\nthe \u2018ideal\u2019 mean-Earth ellipsoid in a tide-free system and the WGS 84 ellipsoid. Due to the fact\nthat the height anomaly to geoid undulation conversion terms do not average to zero globally, the\n-41 cm (\u03b6 ) value results in a -46.3 cm zero-degree geoid undulation value (N ) [20].\nz 0\nThe zero-degree height anomaly (\u03b6 ) that was computed when the WGS 84\nz\nEGM96 geoid was released was equal to -0.53 meters [27]. The primary reason for the change\nin the numerical value of \u03b6 from the EGM96 to the current best estimate is the discovery by\nz\nQuan-Zan Zanife (CLS, France) of an error in the Oscillator Drift correction applied to TOPEX\naltimeter data [30]. The erroneous correction was producing TOPEX Sea Surface Heights biased\nby 12 to 13 centimeters.\n6-2\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n6.2.1 Formulas\nThe formula for calculating the WGS 84 EGM2008 geoid undulations starts with\nthe calculation of the height anomaly (\u03b6)[29]:\n( ) [ \u2211 ( ) \u2211( ) ( )] (6-4)\n( )\n( ( ))\n( )\nEquation (6-4) is evaluated at a point P(r,\uf066\uf0a2,\uf06c) on the surface of the Earth\u2019s\ntopography.\nIn Equation (6-4), the even degree zonal coefficients of degree 2 through 20 are\nremainders after subtracting from the EGM2008 gravitational potential coefficients, the\ncorresponding coefficients implied by the WGS 84 normal gravitational field.\nTable 6.1 WGS 84 Normal Gravitational Potential Coefficients\nC -0.484166774985001E-03 C -0.410790141413244E-16\n2,0(normal) 12,0(normal)\nC 0.790303733511320E-06 C 0.447177357025841E-18\n4,0(normal) 14,0(normal)\nC -0.168724961151417E-08 C -0.346362564744706E-20\n6,0(normal) 16,0(normal)\nC 0.346052468394228E-11 C 0.241145603218922E-22\n8,0(normal) 18,0(normal)\nC -0.265002225746918E-14 C -0.160243292851218E-24\n10,0(normal) 20,0(normal)\nThe relationship between the height anomaly and disturbing potential is given by:\n( )\n( ) (6-5)\nThe geodetic latitude of point P is denoted in the following by \uf06a.

The tide-free definition means that\nany geoid undulations calculated from EGM2008 exist for a tide-free Earth with all (direct and\nindirect) tidal effects of the Sun and Moon removed. Other geoids to consider are the mean\ngeoid (geoid which would exist in the presence of the Sun and Moon) and the zero-tide geoid\n(geoid which exists if the permanent direct effects of the Sun and Moon are removed but the\nindirect effect related to the Earth\u2019s elastic deformation is retained). A complete set of equations\nto convert from one tide system to another can be found in [31].\nTo calculate the geoid in the zero-tide system use the formula:\n6-4\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n( ) (6-8)\nwhere\n6.2.3 Representations and Analysis\nThe geoid undulations can be depicted as a color map showing the deviations of\nthe geoid from the ellipsoid, the latter being selected as the mathematical figure of the Earth.\nFigure 6.1 is such a color map, created from a worldwide 2.5\uf0a2 x 2.5\uf0a2 grid of the WGS 84\nEGM2008 geoid undulations which were calculated using the procedure described in Section\n6.2.1.

WGS 84 RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER GEODETIC SYSTEMS\n7.1 General\nOne of the principal purposes of a world geodetic system is to eliminate the use of\nlocal horizontal geodetic datums by providing a globally consistent reference system. Although\nthe number of local horizontal geodetic datums, counting island and astronomic-based datums,\ncontinues to significantly decrease, there are still several hundred currently in use. Until a global\ngeodetic datum is accepted, used, and implemented worldwide, a means to relate these traditional\ngeodetic datums to WGS 84 is required. To accomplish the conversion, local geodetic datum\nand WGS coordinates are both required at one or more sites within the local datum area so that a\nlocal geodetic datum to WGS datum shift can be computed using a suitable model. Satellite\nstations positioned within WGS 84, with known local geodetic datum coordinates, were the basic\ningredients in the development of local geodetic datum to WGS 84 datum shifts.\nLocal horizontal datums were developed in the past to satisfy mapping and\nnavigation requirements for specific regions of the Earth. Geocentric datums of large geographic\nextent are the Geocentric Datum of Australia (GDA) and the North American Datum of 1983\n(NAD 83). In the past couple of decades, development of global geocentric datums has become\npossible, e.g., WGS 84 and the ITRF.\nApplications requiring precise point positions should not rely on coordinates\nderived from a datum transformation. The most accurate approach for obtaining WGS 84\ncoordinates is to acquire satellite tracking data at the site of interest and position it directly within\nWGS 84 using GPS positioning techniques. Direct occupation of the site, however, is not always\npossible or warranted; and in these cases, a datum transformation can be used to convert\ncoordinates from the local system to WGS 84.\nTransforming local datum coordinates to WGS 84 coordinates does not improve\nthe accuracy of the transformed coordinates. Distortions in the local datum will combine with\nany uncertainties in the datum transformation parameters.\nNGA maintains datum transformation/coordinate conversion software, \u201cMSP\nGeoTrans,\u201d suitable for cartographic purposes. MSP GeoTrans is available at\nhttp://osis.nga.mil/GandG/geotrans/index.htm .\n7.2 Relationship of WGS 84 to the ITRF\nWGS 84 has undergone several enhancements since its original definition. The\npractical realization of the reference frame is determined by a set of globally distributed,\npermanent GPS tracking stations which are aligned with highly accurate ITRF coordinates.\n7-1\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n7.2.1 Agreement With the ITRF\nThe WGS 84 (G1762) Reference Frame compared to ITRF2008 shows a Root\nMean Square (RMS) difference of one centimeter overall. Comparisons between the NGA GPS\nprecise ephemerides, referenced to WGS 84 (G1762), and International GNSS Service (IGS)\nGPS precise ephemerides, referenced to ITRF2008, validate that the two reference systems are\nconsistent. This indicates that these two reference frames are essentially identical with\ndifferences being statistically insignificant for most applications.\n7.2.2 Datums Based on the ITRF\nSome countries and regions have been converting to datums based on the ITRF:\nsuch ITRF-based datums can be considered as identical to WGS 84, e.g., the European\nTerrestrial Reference Frame 1989 (EUREF89) at mapping and charting scales. Users requiring\nhigh accuracies will need to quantify the differences between them.\n7.3 Relationship of WGS 84 to the NAD 83\nIn 1986, a group of institutions representing Canada, Greenland, and the United\nStates of America (USA) adopted the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) as their official\nspatial reference system for geometric positioning [33]. NAD 83 replaced the North American\nDatum of 1927 (NAD 27), and the U.S. National Geodetic Survey (NGS) has already expressed\nits intention to replace NAD 83 around 2022 with a newer geometric reference system. Snay\n[34] discusses the evolution of NAD 83 in the USA since its adoption in 1986, and Craymer [35]\ndiscusses the evolution of NAD 83 in Canada.\nNAD 83 uses the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS 80) ellipsoid as its\nreference ellipsoid with the geometric center of the ellipsoid coincident with the center of mass\nof the Earth and the origin of the coordinate system. The semi-major axis and flattening factor of\nthe Earth parameters are adopted directly as\n1/ =298.257222101\nThe WGS 84 ellipsoid is, for all practical purposes, identical to the GRS 80\nellipsoid. They both use the same value for the semi-major axis and have the same orientation\nwith respect to the center of mass and the coordinate system origin. However, WGS 84 uses a\nderived value for the flattening factor that is computed from the normalized second degree zonal\nharmonic gravitational coefficient ( \u0305 ). This value was derived from the GRS 80 value for J\n2\nand truncated to 8 significant digits as\n\u0305 (7-1)\n\u221a\n7-2\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nThe resulting WGS 84 value for 1/f is 298.257223563. The difference between\nthe GRS 80 and WGS 84 values for f creates a difference of 0.1 mm in the derived semi-minor\naxes of the two ellipsoids.\nThe original NAD 83 reference frame, denoted NAD 83(1986) in the USA, is\nbased on a horizontal adjustment of triangulation and trilateration data with the inclusion of\nTransit Satellite Doppler data and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data. The global\nDoppler and VLBI observations were used to align NAD 83(1986) to the BIH Terrestrial System\nof 1984. Consequently, the origin and orientation of the Earth-centered, Earth-fixed (ECEF)\ncoordinate axes of NAD 83(1986) are identical to that of the original WGS 84 reference frame.\nAfter 1986, both GPS and Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) measurements allowed\ngeodesists to locate the geocenter with a precision of a few centimeters. In doing so, these\ntechnologies revealed that the geocenter adopted for both NAD 83(1986) and the original WGS\n84 reference frame is displaced by more than two meters from the true geocenter. Similarly,\nGPS, SLR, and VLBI revealed that the orientation of the Cartesian axes of NAD 83(1986) and\nthe original WGS 84 is misaligned by over 0.03 arc seconds relative to the orientation associated\nwith current versions of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), and that the scale\nof NAD 83(1986) and the original WGS 84 differs by approximately 0.0871 parts per million\n(ppm) from the true definition of a meter.\nThese discrepancies caused significant concern as the use of highly accurate GPS\nmeasurements proliferated. As a result, both NAD 83 and WGS 84 have evolved over the past\nfew decades. In 1994, DoD introduced a new WGS 84 realization, called WGS 84 (G730),\nwhose origin, orientation and scale would be identical to those adopted for the International\nTerrestrial Reference Frame of 1991 (ITRF91). Hence, from 1994 onward, NAD 83 coordinates\nand WGS 84 coordinates have systematically differed by more than two meters.\n7.3.1 Transforming WGS 84 (G1762) Coordinates to Current NAD 83\nCoordinates\nBecause WGS 84 (G1762) is aligned to ITRF2008, the transformation from WGS\n84 (G1762) to each of the current NAD 83 reference frames; namely, NAD 83(2011), NAD\n83(PA11) and NAD 83(MA11); is the same as the corresponding transformation from ITRF2008\nto each of these three current NAD 83 reference frames. Pearson and Snay [36] present the\nmathematical procedure for transforming coordinates from ITRF2008 to the three current NAD\n83 frames. For the sake of completeness, their procedure is given here in terms of transforming\ncoordinates from WGS 84 (G1762) to the three current NAD 83 frames.\nLet x(t)A ,y(t)A, and z(t)A denote the positional coordinates of a location at time t\nreferred to reference frame A in a 3D-ECEF Cartesian coordinate system. These coordinates are\nexpressed as a function of time to reflect the reality of crustal motion. Similarly, let x(t)B, y(t)B,\nand z(t)B denote the positional coordinates of this same location at time (t) referred to reference\nframe B also in a 3D-ECEF Cartesian coordinate system. The coordinates in frame A are\napproximately related to those in frame B via the following equations of a 14-parameter\ntransformation:\n7-3\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n( ) ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( )] ( ) ( ) ( ) (7-2)\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ( )] ( )\nTx(t), Ty(t), and Tz(t) are translations along the x-, y-, and z-axis, respectively;\nwx(t), wy(t), and wz(t) are counterclockwise rotations about these same three axes; and s(t) is the\ndifferential scale between reference frame A and reference frame B. These approximate\nequations suffice because the three rotations have relatively small magnitudes. Note: Each of the\nseven quantities is represented as a function of time because modern geodetic technology has\nenabled scientists to detect their time-related variations with some degree of accuracy. These\ntime-related variations are assumed to be linear, so that each of the seven quantities may be\nexpressed by an equation of the form:\n( ) ( ) \u0307( ) (7-3)\nwhere \u03c4 denotes a prespecified time of reference and the two quantities, P(\u03c4) and \u0307, are\nconstants. Thus, the seven quantities give rise to 14 parameters, but notice that the values of\nseven of these parameters depend on the value chosen for \u03c4. The following table provides\nparameter values for \u03c4 = 1997.0; i.e., January 1, 1997.\n7-4\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nTable 7.1 Parameters for transforming WGS 84 (G1762) coordinates to NAD 83 coordinates.\nParameter Units NAD 83(2011) NAD 83(PA11) NAD 83(MA11)\nT (1997.0) meters +0.99343 +0.9080 +0.9080\nx\nT (1997.0) meters -1.90331 -2.0161 -2.0161\ny\nT (1997.0) meters -0.52655 -0.5653 -0.5653\nz\nw (1997.0) nanoradians +125.63787 +134.49216 +140.45537\nx\nw (1997.0) nanoradians +45.70072 +65.29956 +50.51759\ny\nw (1997.0) nanoradians +56.23524 +13.14815 +43.28416\nz\ns(1997.0) parts per billion +1.71504 +1.10 +1.10\n\u0307 meters/yr +0.00079 +0.0001 +0.0001\nx\n\u0307 meters/yr -0.00060 +0.0001 +0.0001\ny\n\u0307 meters/yr -0.00134 -0.0018 -0.0018\nz\n\u0307 nanoradians/yr +0.32322 -1.86168 -0.09696\nx\n\u0307 nanoradians/yr -3.67217 +4.88207 +0.50905\ny\n\u0307 nanoradians/yr -0.24886 -10.59803 -1.68230\nz\n\u0307 parts-per-billion/yr -0.10201 +0.08 +0.08\nAs reflected in Equations (7-2) and (7-3), the transformation from WGS 84\n(G1762) to each of the current NAD 83 reference frames depends on the variable t (expressed in\ndecimal years). This variable denotes the epoch associated with the coordinates. This epoch\noften corresponds to the date the coordinates were measured; however, sometimes the\ncoordinates have been converted to some other epoch of particular significance so that\ncoordinates measured at one time may be compared with coordinates measured at other times.\nSuch a conversion requires knowledge of how the coordinates have moved over time. The\nHorizontal Time-Dependent Positioning (HTDP) utility\n( www.geodesy.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Htdp/Htdp.shtml ) contains numerical models for horizontal\ncrustal motion which enables its users to convert horizontal coordinates from one epoch to\nanother for locations in the USA. HTDP also incorporates the parameters given here to enable\nits users to transform coordinates between WGS 84 (G1762) and the current NAD 83 reference\nframes.\n7-5\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n7.4 Three-parameter Geometric Transformations\nLocal geodetic systems often contain non-linear distortions, poorly known\nrelationships to the geoid, and lack quantifiable absolute accuracy. For most DoD operations and\napplications involving datum shifts, WGS 84 coordinates will be obtained by a Local Geodetic\nDatum to WGS 84 Datum Transformation. A shift of an ellipsoid\u2019s origin (neglecting changes in\nscale and misalignment of the axes) satisfies most mapping and charting requirements. A three\nparameter model can be applied to geocentric Cartesian coordinates; or when used with\nellipsoidal change parameters in the Molodensky transformation equations, applied to curvilinear\ncoordinates. These shifts are reversible. The prime meridian was assumed to be Greenwich in\nthe development of these shifts.\nThe datum shift parameters (\u0394X, \u0394Y, \u0394Z) are the distances between the center of\na local geodetic system\u2019s ellipsoid and the center of the WGS 84 ellipsoid, i.e., the center of the\nlocal ellipsoid in WGS 84 coordinates.\nAppendix C lists the reference ellipsoid names and parameters (semi-major axis\nand flattening factor) for local datums currently tied to WGS 84 and used for generating datum\ntransformations.\nAppendix D contains horizontal transformation parameters for the geodetic\ndatums/systems which have been generated from satellite ties to the local geodetic control.\nUpdates to the datum transformation parameters are identified through the use of\ncycle numbers and issue dates. Cycle numbers have been set to the numerical value of zero for\nall datum transformations appearing in the August 1993 Insert 1 and the WGS 84 TR8350.2\nSecond Edition. New datum transformations will carry a cycle number of zero. As updates are\nmade the cycle number will increment by one.\nDatum transformation shifts derived from non-satellite information are listed in\nAppendix E.\n7.4.1 Transformation to WGS 84 Cartesian Coordinates\nThe shift parameters can be applied directly to the local geocentric system as\n(7-4)\n7.4.2 Transformation to WGS 84 Geodetic Coordinates: Three-step Method\nLocal geodetic coordinates can be transformed to WGS 84 in three steps:\n7-6\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n1) Convert the local geodetic coordinates to local geocentric Cartesian coordinates using the\nlocal ellipsoid parameters.\n2) Shift the local geocentric Cartesian coordinates to WGS 84 geocentric coordinates.\n3) Convert the WGS 84 geocentric Cartesian coordinates to WGS 84 geodetic coordinates\nusing the parameters of the WGS 84 ellipsoid.\n\uf020\n\uf020 \uf020 \uf037\uf02e\uf034\uf02e\uf033\uf020 Transformation to WGS 84 Geodetic Coordinates: Molodensky Shifts\n\u03bb (7-5)\nwhere \uf044 \uf02c\uf020\uf044\uf06c\uf02c\uf020\uf044h are provided by the standard Molodensky transformation formulas [37], [38]\nas\n{ ( )\u2044\n[ ( \u2044 ) ( \u2044 )] } [( ) ]\n[ ] [( ) ]\n(7-5)\n( \u2044 )\n( \u2044 )\nwhere\n( )\n(\n)\n(\n)\nwhere\n7-7\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n( ) ( )\nNOTE: AS \u201ch\u2019s\u201d ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL GEODETIC\nDATUMS, THE \uf044h CORRECTION WILL NOT BE APPLICABLE\nWHEN TRANSFORMING TO WGS 84\n( )\n\u2044\n( )\n\u221a\n( )\n\u221a\nNOTE: All \uf044-quantities are formed by subtracting local geodetic datum\nellipsoid values from WGS 84 Ellipsoid values.\nDue to the errors and distortions that affect most local geodetic datums, the use of\nmean datum shifts (\uf044X, \uf044Y, \uf044Z) in the standard Molodensky datum transformation formulas\nmay produce results with a poor quality of \u201cfit\u201d. Improved fit between the local datum and WGS\n84 may result only with better and denser ties with local or regional control points.\n7-8\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n7.5 Seven-parameter Geometric Transformations\nThe seven-parameter transformation model assumes the local and WGS 84\nCartesian axes can be related by rotations of the three axes, a change of scale (\u0394s), and a shift of\nthe origin (\u0394X, \u0394Y, \u0394Z).\nFigure 7.1 Seven-Parameter Transformation\nTwo seven-parameter transformation models (Coordinate Frame Rotation and\nPosition Vector Transformation) are in widespread use. They work best for geocentric datums\nthat are distortion free, like an ITRF to WGS 84 transformation, or other modern satellite derived\ndatums. They are, however, often used for datums that do not meet these criteria. The models\ndiffer by whether rotation is of the axes (frame) or of the position vector. With approximations,\nthese models can be related by changing the signs of the rotation angles. The use of the actual\nangles instead of their cosines and sines as elements in the rotation matrices (the small angle\napproximation) has been studied and generally leads to coordinate errors in the millimeter range\n[39]. If there are no rotations, the models are the same. If there are no rotations or scale change\nthe models degenerate to the three-parameter shifts.\n7-9\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n7.5.1 Coordinate Frame Rotation Model\nThe coordinate frame rotation model, widely used in the United States and\nAustralia, can be expressed as\n[ ] [ ] [ ][ ] (7-6)\nwhere\n7.5.2 Position Vector Transformation Model\nThe position vector transformation model, used by IERS [1] and recommended\nfor use by NATO members, can be expressed as\n[ ] [ ] ( )[ ][ ] (7-7)\nwhere\nS = the scale correction\n7.5.3 Approximate Equivalency of the Models\n( )\n(7-8)\n( )\n( )\n7-10\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n7.6 Molodensky-Badekas Transformation Model\nIt may be advantageous to relate a local datum to a global satellite-derived one by the\nMolodensky-Badekas model; also known as the 7 + 3 model.\nIn this model, the rotations and scale change take place in the region of interest, not the\ngeocenter, hence the additional three parameters. This is done to alleviate high correlations that\nmay exist among the usual seven parameters when computed at the geocenter.\nThis model can have two variations of rotations, as was described for the seven parameter\nmodels. A drawback to this method is that it is not reversible in the absolute sense. It is\ndescribed by:\n[ ] ( )[ ][ ] [ ] [ ] (7-9)\nwhere\n7.7 Datum Transformation Multiple Regression Equations (MRE)\nThe development of Local Geodetic Datum to WGS 84 Datum Transformation\nMultiple Regression Equations [40] was initiated to obtain better fits over continental-size land\nareas than could be achieved using the standard Molodensky formula with datum shifts (\uf044X, \uf044Y,\n\uf044Z).\nFor \uf044 , the general form of the Multiple Regression Equation is (also see [40]):\n(7-10)\nwhere\n( )\n( )\n( )\n7-11\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n( )\nSimilar equations are obtained for \uf044\uf06c and \uf044h by replacing \uf044 in the left portion\nof Equation (7-10) by \uf044\uf06c and \uf044h, respectively.\nLocal Geodetic Datum to WGS 84 Datum Transformation Multiple Regression\nEquations for seven major continental-size datums, covering contiguous land areas with large\ndistortion, are provided in Appendix F. The main advantage of MREs lies in modeling of\ndistortion for better fit in geodetic applications. However, caution must be used to ensure that\nMREs are not extrapolated outside of the area of intended use. Large distortions can be realized\nin very short distances outside of the area where the stations that were used in the development\nof the MREs exist.\n7.8 WGS 72 to WGS 84\nSee Appendix G.\n7.9 Datums Equivalent to WGS 84 for Mapping and Charting Purposes\nSee Appendix H for a list of datums that can be considered equivalent to\nWGS 84 for use at scales of 1:5,000 and larger.\n7-12\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n8. ACCURACY OF COORDINATES REFERENCED TO WGS 84\n8.1 Discussion\nNumerous techniques exist to establish WGS 84 coordinates for a given site or\nposition. The accuracy and precision achieved by these various techniques vary significantly.\nThe most common, currently available techniques are listed below:\n\uf0b7 General geodetic solution for station coordinates, orbits, and other parameters of\ninterest\n\uf0b7 Direct geodetic point positioning at a stationary, solitary station using a \u2018geodetic-\nquality\u2019, dual frequency GPS receiver and NGA Precise Ephemerides and Satellite\nClock States (note that the effects of Selective Availability (SA) must be removed if\nSA is not set to zero)\n\uf0b7 Same as above but using the Broadcast GPS Ephemerides and Clock States\n\uf0b7 GPS differential (baseline) processing from known WGS 84 sites [41]\n\uf0b7 GPS Precise Positioning Service (PPS) navigation solutions [42]\no Instantaneous\no Mean over some averaging interval\n\uf0b7 GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) navigation solutions [43]\no Instantaneous\no Mean over some averaging interval\n\uf0b7 Photogrammetrically-derived coordinates from NGA products\n\uf0b7 Map-derived coordinates from digital or paper NGA products\n\uf0b7 Coordinate conversion based on transformation from a different geodetic datum to\nWGS 84\nClearly, the above positioning techniques do not provide WGS 84 coordinates\nwith uniform accuracy and statistical properties. Even within a given technique, accuracy\nvariations can occur due, for example, to the treatment of certain error sources such as the\ntroposphere. Because of these variations and periodic algorithm improvements, full\ncharacterization of the accuracy achieved by all the above techniques would be quite challenging\nand beyond the scope of this document.\nIn the terminology of Chapter 2, a network of stations obtained from one of these\ntechniques yields a unique realization of the WGS 84 reference frame. Currently, within the\nDoD, almost all operational geodetic survey requirements can be met with direct geodetic point\n8-1\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\npositioning with GPS. The NGA-developed technique [44] [45] which performs this function\nhas been demonstrated to achieve an accuracy at a single station of:\n2012 - present: 5 cm (1\u03c3), in each of the 3 position components (\u03c6, \u03bb, h)\n2010 - 2012: 10 cm (1 \u03c3), in each of the 3 position components (\u03c6, \u03bb, h)\n1994 - 2010: 30 cm (1 \u03c3), in each of the 3 position components (\u03c6, \u03bb, h)\n1989 - 1994: 100 cm (1 \u03c3), in each of the 3 position components (\u03c6, \u03bb, h)\n8.2 Techniques for Obtaining WGS 84 Coordinates.\nOther techniques based on older, previously established survey coordinates have\nbeen used in the past to yield \u2018WGS 84\u2019 coordinates with limited accuracy. Precise positions\ncomputed many years ago are no longer precise due to movement of the Earth as discussed in\nChapter 2. Knowledge of the inherent accuracy of these positions and the accuracy required of\nthe operation is critical for any usage to be valid for operational requirements. These legacy\ntechniques may be suitable for very limited mapping applications where accuracy is not a\nconcern. Some of these alternate techniques to obtain WGS 84 coordinates are listed below:\n\uf0b7 TRANSIT Point Positioning directly in WGS 84 (1 \u03c3 = 1-2 m)\n\uf0b7 TRANSIT Point Positions transformed from NSWC-9Z2\n\uf0b7 GPS differential (baseline) processing from a known (TRANSIT-determined) WGS\n84 geodetic point position\n\uf0b7 WGS 72 to WGS 84 Coordinate Transformation\n\uf0b7 Local Geodetic Datum to WGS 84 Datum Transformation\n\uf0b7 Non-WGS 84-based reference systems\nBecause geospatial information within the DoD often originates from multiple\nsources and processes, the absolute accuracy of a given WGS 84 position becomes very\nimportant when information from these various sources is combined in Geographic Information\nSystems or \u2018geospatial databases\u2019. Due to their high fidelity, surveyed WGS 84 geodetic control\npoints can often serve to improve or validate the accuracy of maps, image products, or other\ngeospatial information. Even GPS navigation solutions can serve a similar role, as long as the\naccuracy of these solutions is well understood.\n8.3 Summary\nIn summary, while WGS 84 provides a common global framework for all\ngeospatial information within the DoD, the accuracy of each \u2018layer\u2019 of information depends\n8-2\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nlargely on the metric fidelity of the process used to collect that information. WGS 84-surveyed\ncontrol points provide an accuracy level which meets or exceeds all current operational DoD\nrequirements. The user must ensure that the method chosen to obtain WGS 84 coordinates meets\ntheir accuracy requirements.\n8-3\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n9. THE WORLD MAGNETIC MODEL\n9.1 Introduction\nAt every location on or above the Earth, its magnetic field has a more or less well-\nknown direction which can be used as a reference frame to orient ships, aircraft, satellites,\nantennas, drilling equipment, and handheld devices. At some places on the globe the horizontal\ndirection of the magnetic field coincides with the direction of geographic north (\u201ctrue\u201d north),\nbut in general this is not the case. The angular amount by which the horizontal direction of the\nmagnetic field differs from true north is called the magnetic declination, or simply declination\n(D). This is the correction required to convert between a magnetic bearing and a true bearing.\nThe main utility of the World Magnetic Model (WMM) is to provide the magnetic declination\nfor any desired location on the globe. In addition to the magnetic declination, the WMM also\nprovides the complete geometry of the field from 1 km below the Earth\u2019s surface to 850 km\nabove the surface. The magnetic field extends deep into the Earth and far out into space, but the\nWMM is not valid there.\nThe Earth\u2019s magnetism has several sources. All the sources will affect a scientific\nor navigational instrument, but only some of them are represented in the WMM. The strongest\ncontributor, by far, is the magnetic field produced by the Earth\u2019s liquid-iron outer core, called the\n\u201ccore field\u201d. Magnetic minerals in the crust and upper mantle make a further contribution that\ncan be locally significant. Electric currents induced by the flow of conducting sea water through\nthe ambient magnetic field make a further, albeit weak, contribution to the observed magnetic\nfield. All of these are of \u201cinternal\u201d origin. Deliberately excluded from the WMM, by the data\nselection process and by other means, are the so-called \u201cdisturbance fields\u201d. These are\ncontributions arising from electric currents in the upper atmosphere and near-Earth space.\nBecause the \u201cexternal\u201d magnetic fields so produced are time-varying, there is a further effect.\nThey induce electric currents in the Earth and oceans, producing secondary internal magnetic\nfields, which are considered part of the disturbance field and are therefore not represented in the\nWMM.\nThe mathematical method of the WMM is an expansion of the magnetic potential\ninto spherical harmonic functions up to degree and order 12. The minimum wavelength resolved\nis 360\u00b0 / \u221a = 28.8\u00b0 in arc-length, corresponding to 3200 km at the Earth\u2019s surface. The\nWMM is a model of those internal magnetic fields that are not part of the disturbance field and\nhave spatial wavelengths exceeding 30\u00b0 in arc-length. This includes almost the entire core field\nand the long-wavelength portion of the crustal and oceanic fields. The term \u201cmain field\u201d refers to\nthe portion of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field at epoch 2010.0 that is modeled by the WMM.\nThe core field changes perceptibly from year to year. This effect, called secular\nvariation (SV), is accounted for in the WMM by a linear SV model. Specifically, a straight line is\nused as the model of the time-dependence of each coefficient of the spherical harmonic\nrepresentation of the magnetic potential. Due to unpredictable, non-linear changes in the core\nfield, the values of the WMM coefficients need to be updated every five years. WMM2010, is\nvalid from 2010.0 to 2015.0.\n9-1\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n9.2 The Elements of the Magnetic Field\nThe geomagnetic field vector (B ) is described by 7 elements. These are the\nm\nnortherly intensity (X), the easterly intensity (Y), the vertical intensity (Z) (positive downwards),\nand the following quantities derived from X, Y, and Z: the horizontal intensity (H), the total\nintensity (F), the inclination angle (I), (also called the dip angle and measured from the\nhorizontal plane to the field vector, positive downwards), and the declination angle (D) (also\ncalled the magnetic variation and measured clockwise from true north to the horizontal\ncomponent of the field vector). In the descriptions of X, Y, Z, H, F, I and D above, the vertical\ndirection is perpendicular to the WGS 84 ellipsoid model of the Earth, the horizontal plane is\nperpendicular to the vertical direction, and the rotational directions clockwise and counter-\nclockwise are determined by a view from above.\nThe quantities X, Y, and Z are the sizes of perpendicular vectors that add\nvectorially to B . Conversely, X, Y, and Z can be determined from the quantities F, I, and D\nm\n(i.e., the quantities that specify the size and direction of B ).\nm\n9.3 Grid Variation\nIn the polar regions, or near the rotation axis of the Earth, the angle D changes\nstrongly with a change in the longitude of the observer, and is therefore a poor measure of the\ndirection of B . For this reason, the WMM technical report and software have defined an\nm\nauxiliary angle, GV, for the direction of B in the horizontal plane. Its definition is:\nm\n(9-1)\nwhere\nThe angle GV should also be understood as the angle on the plane of the\nUniversal Polar Stereographic (UPS) grid for the appropriate hemisphere at the observer\u2019s\nlocation measured clockwise from the direction parallel to the UPS Northing axis (y-axis) to the\nhorizontal component of B . To emphasize this, the designation GV may be used for the\nm UPS\nabove.\nThe quantity GV defined above is an example of a more general concept,\nUPS\nnamely grid variation or grivation. Grivation is the angle on the plane of a chosen grid\ncoordinate system at the observer\u2019s location, measured clockwise from the direction parallel to\nthe grid\u2019s Northing axis to the horizontal component of B . It is useful for local surveys, where\nm\nlocation is given by grid coordinates rather than by longitude and latitude. Grivation is dependent\non the map projection used to define the grid coordinates. In general it is:\n9-2\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n(9-2)\nwhere\n(\n)\nLarge scale military topographic mapping routinely employs the Universal\nTransverse Mercator (UTM) grid coordinates for the map projection of the sheet, for the\ndefinition of a grid to overprint, and for a grivation calculation as defined above. The latter\ncould be notated GV .\nUTM\n9.4 Range of the Magnetic Elements at the Earth\u2019s Surface\nTable 9.1 shows the expected range of the magnetic field elements, measured in\nnanoTeslas, and GV at the Earth\u2019s surface.\nTable 9.1Ranges of Magnetic Elements and GV at the Earth's Surface\nRange at Earth\u2019s Surface\nAlternative Positive\nElement Name\nName Sense\nMin Max Unit\nNortherly\nX North component -17000 42000 nT North\nintensity\nEasterly\nY East component -18000 17000 nT East\nintensity\nVertical\nZ Down component -67000 61000 nT Down\nintensity\nH Horizontal intensity 0 42000 nT\nF Total intensity Total field 22000 67000 nT\nI Inclination Dip -90 90 Degree Down\nMagnetic East /\nD Declination -180 180 Degree\nvariation Clockwise\nEast /\nGV Grid variation Grivation -180 180 Degree\nClockwise\n9.5 Model Representation\nThis section describes the representation of the magnetic field in the WMM.

The most common\nunderstanding is that they are the positions on the Earth's surface where the geomagnetic field is\nvertical, that is, perpendicular to the ellipsoid. These positions are called dip poles, and the north\nand south dip poles do not have to be (and are not now) antipodal.\n9-7\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nOther definitions originate from models of the geomagnetic field. The WMM\nrepresentation of this field includes a magnetic dipole at the center of the Earth. This dipole\ndefines an axis that intersects the Earth's surface at two antipodal points, known as geomagnetic\npoles. The geomagnetic poles, otherwise known as the dipole poles, can be computed from the\nfirst three Gauss coefficients of the WMM. Based on the WMM2010 coefficients for 2010.0, the\ngeomagnetic north pole is at 72.21\u00b0W longitude and 80.02\u00b0N geocentric latitude (80.08\u00b0N\ngeodetic latitude); and the geomagnetic south pole is at 107.79\u00b0E longitude and 80.02\u00b0S\ngeocentric latitude (80.08\u00b0S geodetic latitude). The axis of the dipole is currently inclined at\n9.98\u00b0 to the Earth's rotation axis. The same dipole is the basis for the simple geomagnetic\ncoordinate system of geomagnetic latitude and longitude. The geomagnetic equator is at\ngeomagnetic latitude 0\u00b0.\n9-8\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n10. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES\n10.1 Introduction\nWGS 84 represents the current state-of-the-art NSG operational reference system\nwhich is a realization of the ITRF 2008 based on the IERS Conventions (2010) as outlined in\nIERS TN 36. This new realization is titled WGS 84 (G1762). Since G1762 is a realization of\nthe IERS reference frame, it incorporates the most current and modern analysis and data\nincluding SLR, LLR and VLBI systems.\nWGS 84 (G1762) supports the most stringent accuracy requirements for geodetic\npositioning, navigation and mapping within the NSG. WGS 84 (G1762) accuracy is less than\n1cm in each axis of the WGS 84 ECEF coordinate system.\nIt is the policy of NGA to continually improve components of the WGS 84 system\nto maintain it as a state-of-the-art NSG operational World Geodetic System. This will lead to\nimprovements in the definition and realization of the system as\n\uf0b7 The basic tracking stations which are used are updated, repositioned or their number is\nincreased\n\uf0b7 Additional data make it possible to improve the accuracy of individual local datum\nrelationships to WGS 84\n\uf0b7 Additional surface gravity data become available in various areas of the world to improve\nthe gravity and geoid models\n\uf0b7 Five year updates of the World Magnetic Model\nThe current definition of WGS 84 recognizes the continually changing physical\nEarth, shifting of internal masses and continental plate motions and accommodates this time\ndependence in its definition through reference station velocities. For the high accuracy geodetic\npositioning requirements, this requires a time epoch to be defined for all station coordinates since\nthey are in continual motion. As mentioned previously in this standard, the coordinates of the\nfixed GPS tracking stations WGS 84 (G1762) adheres to IERS TN 36 which is an improvement\nto previous WGS 84 reference frames.\nAs a consequence of the inherent high accuracy and continual refinement of the\ndefinition and realization of WGS 84, considerable care should be taken in the implementation of\nthis system into existing and future weapons systems and geospatial information systems. This\nChapter will address some of the considerations that should be made prior to the implementation\nof WGS 84 to ensure that the full benefits of WGS 84 are realized and are consistent with the\noperational product accuracy and interoperability requirements of the users.\n10.2 Updates to WGS 84\nIt is important that systems implement the WGS 84 information relative to the\ngravity field, geoid, and datum transformations in a manner that will allow future update of\nspecific portions of the data. These data will change with future refinements of WGS 84, as\n10-1\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nimproved information becomes available to NGA, and this may necessitate updates to existing\nimplementations as future operational accuracy requirements become known. For example,\nimplementations of the geoid undulation values as a grid in a lookup table may facilitate easier\nfuture updates than implementation as spherical harmonic coefficients. NGA recommends that\nNSG systems be designed to allow for updates to the WGS 84 system, data, parameters,\nand algorithms.\n10.3 WGS 84 Reference Frame and Coordinate Systems\nNGA is committed to maintaining the highest possible accuracy and stability for\nthe WGS 84 Reference Frame. To do so, NGA has generated several realizations of WGS 84,\nincorporating improved data and advances in geophysical modeling to define the motion of the\nearth\u2019s surface. These realizations have not affected the fundamental definition of the WGS 84\nreference system but the improvements may be necessary for high-accuracy, high-integrity\napplications.\nAs described in Chapter 2, the WGS 84 Coordinate System is a right-handed,\northogonal and Earth-fixed coordinate system which is intended to be as closely coincident as\npossible with the CTRS defined by the IERS or, prior to 1988, its predecessor, the Bureau\nInternational de l\u2019Heure (BIH). The current realization of the WGS 84 Reference Frame is\ndesignated as WGS 84 (G1762). The GPS Operational Control Segment (OCS) implemented\nWGS 84 (G1762) on 16 Oct 2013.\nThe WGS 84 Reference Frame and Coordinate System are delivered via the\nGPS. The most accurate approach for obtaining WGS 84 coordinates is to acquire satellite\ntracking data at the site of interest and position it directly in WGS 84 using GPS positioning\ntechniques. For precise surveying applications, it is recommended that coordinates be\nmaintained with an epoch assigned to each coordinate determination along with an indication of\nthe fixed station GPS coordinate set used for the realization, such as WGS 84 (G1762).\n10.4 Ellipsoid and Its Defining Parameters\nThe WGS 84 is comprised of a coherent set of parameters. NGA recommends\nthat the NSG implement the WGS 84 parameters and equations presented in this document\n(and supporting documentation) without substitution or deletion. Substitution or deletions\nmay lead to degraded WGS 84 products, interoperability problems, and may have other adverse\neffects.\n10.5 The World Magnetic Model (WMM)\nThe main utility of the World Magnetic Model (WMM) is to provide magnetic\ndeclination for any desired location on the globe. In addition to the magnetic declination, the\nWMM also provides the complete geometry of the field from 1 km below the Earth\u2019s surface to\n850 km above the surface. The magnetic field extends deep into the Earth and far out into space,\nbut the WMM is not valid there. NGA recommends that the NSG implement the World\n10-2\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nMagnetic Model as described in, The US/UK World Magnetic Model for 2010-2015, NOAA\nTechnical Report NESDIS/NGDC.\n10.6 WGS 84 Relationships with other Geodetic Systems\nBefore satellite geodetic techniques became available, the local horizontal datum\nwas defined independently of the local vertical datum. NGA has developed datum\ntransformations to convert over 120 local horizontal datums to WGS 84. This generally entails\nmaking survey ties between a number of local geodetic control points and their corresponding\ngeodetic positions derived from satellite observations. NGA did this for many years with\nDoppler observations from TRANSIT satellites and continues to do it now with GPS. Aside from\nthe countless maps and charts which are still based on these classical local datums, numerous\nland records, property boundaries and other geographic information in many countries are\nreferenced to local datums.\nModern maps, navigation systems and geodetic applications require a single\naccessible, global, 3-dimensional reference frame. It is important for global operations and\ninteroperability that NSG systems implement and operate as much as possible on WGS 84.\nNGA recommends that all NSG systems operate in the 3-dimensional WGS 84 datum.\nUniversal use of the WGS 84 datum and positional reference system will reduce confusion\nregarding which datum system is being used and increase interoperability.\nThere is currently no world vertical system defined to unify and tie together local\nvertical systems. Generally the vertical datum is defined by a series of tide gauges in the area or\nby approximating mean sea level by the geoid, leading to numerous realizations of mean sea\nlevel. Unfortunately, the local geodetic coordinates on these datums are of limited use for\nmodern survey, navigation and mapping operations. NGA recommends that all heights be\nreported as WGS 84 ellipsoidal heights (also known as geodetic heights). If a MSL height is\nrequired, NGA recommends that orthometric heights computed from WGS 84 Earth\nGravitational Model 2008, or the current model, be used to compute these MSL heights.\n10.7 The Earth Gravitational Model EGM2008 and Geoid Model\nNearly every system and component of WGS 84 has nearly ubiquitous and\nuniversal implementation throughout the NSG, except for the Earth gravitational model and\ngeoids. The purpose of the geoid is to perform a datum transformation between ellipsoid heights\nand orthometric heights (or Mean Sea Level). Numerous and incompatible implementations\nstem from many sources, including data file size and a general lack of understanding of the true\nnature of the geoid\u2019s transformation relationship between ellipsoid height and orthometric\nheights (or Mean Sea Level). Past implementation guidance for geoids recommended that the\napplication determine their overall accuracy and then decimate the geoid grid to their accuracy,\nin essence, editing and changing the transformation. For those systems that require a Mean\nSea Level height, NGA recommends that orthometric heights computed from the WGS 84\nEarth Gravitational Model 2008 be used to compute these MSL heights.\n10-3\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nAn Earth orbiting satellite\u2019s sensitivity to the geopotential is strongly influenced\nby the satellite\u2019s altitude range and other orbital parameters. NSG programs performing satellite\norbit determination are advised to determine the maximum degree and order most appropriate for\ntheir particular mission and orbit accuracy requirements. The EGM2008 through degree and\norder 70 is recommended for high accuracy satellite orbit determination and prediction\npurposes.\n10.8 Positioning, Navigation and Targeting (PN&T) Applications\nPositioning, Navigation and Targeting is concerned with location and moving in\nreal-time or after the fact on land, air and sea platforms. Accuracy requirements may vary from\nthe centimeter level for precise geodetic applications, such as aerial photogrammetry, to meters\nfor combined integrated GPS/Inertial Navigation Systems, to tens of meters for the SPS GPS\nuser. PN&T applications are also characterized by large numbers of systems in the field, e.g.\nmore than 100,000 GPS military receivers, with legacy systems having different\nimplementations of WGS 84 than the newer systems. Implementation and update of WGS 84 in\nthese platforms are costly and almost impossible to accomplish simultaneously. Therefore, a\ncareful analysis must be done for each implementation to determine the essential elements of the\nrefined definition of WGS 84 that need to be implemented.\nIt should be noted that most users depend on the ECEF coordinate system but for\nsome they must depend on the Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) reference frame. This inertial\nreference frame is a stationary reference frame from which Newton\u2019s equations of motion hold\ntrue. The ECI coordinates are then transformed into ECEF coordinates using Earth Orientation\nParameters (EOP). They are the parameters which provide the rotation of ECI to ECEF\nReference frame as function of time, see definition for EOP. These EOP values and models are\navailable at http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/sathtml/index.html and can be downloaded via\nFTP.\n10.9 Geospatial Information Applications\nGeospatial databases contain information from various sources as thematic layers\nfrom which imagery, imagery intelligence and geospatial information can be derived or\nextracted. Since the information represented in the various layers has multiple uses and supports\napplications of different accuracies, it is important that the accuracy of the basic information be\nretained. Therefore, the refined WGS 84 should be implemented in geospatial systems to\nmaintain the inherent accuracy of the basic data sources.\n10.10 Cartographic Applications\nThe definition and realization of WGS 84 as defined in TR8350.2, Second\nEdition, satisfies the NSG\u2019s mapping and charting requirements to better than 1 meter.\nTherefore, the improvement and refinements presented in this document for the WGS 84\nreference frame, coordinate system, Earth gravitational model and datum transformations, is\nmore than adequate for cartographic and mapping applications.\n10-4\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nThe current national horizontal map accuracy standard indicates that well defined\npoints should be located with accuracy of better than 1/30 of an inch (0.85 mm) at a 90 percent\nconfidence level on maps with scales greater than 1:20,000. This translates to 8.5 m on a\n1:10,000 scale map which is easily met by WGS 84, assuming, of course, that the mapping\nproducts are on WGS 84 and not a local datum. If the maps or charts are on a local datum, then\nthe application of appropriate datum transformation is necessary to preserve interoperability with\nother geospatial information. Depending on the local datum, the accuracy of the datum\ntransformations can vary from 1 meter to over 25 meters in each Cartesian component.\nThe vertical accuracy of geospatial information and resulting map products\ndepends on how the elevations were compiled. If the elevations are based on first order geodetic\nleveling, the control heights are very accurate, probably good to centimeters with respect to\n\u2018local mean sea level\u2019. A height bias in the local mean sea level would be the major potential\nerror source. If no leveling data are available for vertical control, elevations are estimated from\nheight above the WGS 84 Ellipsoid and a geoid height derived from the WGS 84 Geoid model.\nFor mapping processes which use imagery, the orthometric heights (height above the geoid) are\nsubstituted for elevations above mean sea level. For these products the Earth Gravitational Model\n2008 (EGM2008), which provides a geoid with an accuracy of < 25cm worldwide, should be\nimplemented.\n10.11 Summary\nUsers need to implement the refinements of the WGS 84 (NGA.STND.0036) into\napplication systems in a planned and well thought out manner. An analysis into what aspects of\nthese refinements are required for specific applications should be performed. This will ensure\nthat the applications have indeed implemented WGS84 in the most effective manner.\nA new realization of the WGS 84 reference frame, tied to the IERS TN 36 and\nInternational Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) 2010, will be established in 2014. In Mid-\n2015, a new edition of NGA.STND.0036 incorporating this 2014 WGS 84 reference frame and\nan updated WMM 2015 will be written and propagated. This 5th edition will begin a five-year\nupdate cycle of the Standard and its related models as required. The 2020 update may be a\nrigorous review of the WGS which may result in refining parameters for the WGS.\n10-5\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nREFERENCES\n1. IERS Conventions (2010).

General\nThis appendix provides a summary of the formulation used by NGA for\ntransformation between the Earth-Center Inertial (ECI) system and the Earth-\nCentered Earth-Fixed coordinate system (ECEF) and is a summary of information\ncontained in the IERS Technical Note 36 [1]. Technical Note 36 provides detailed\ninformation on the description of time systems, coordinate frames, and various other\nmodels. Technical Note 36 also describes the ECI-ECEF transformation for both the\nequinox-based approach and the CIO-based approach. The following description\nfocuses on the CIO-based approach. It is noted the description of any ECI-ECEF\ntransformation cannot be exact and is limited to a prescribed accuracy. Also, portions\nof the transformation are described by various series expressions, some of which\nentail dozens of terms. Instead of publishing the tables that describe the series\nexpressions, references are made to the necessary electronic files that contain the\nappropriate data. Also, some hyperlinks are provided to IERS websites for the files;\nhowever, the reader is reminded that not all hyperlinks exist forever.\nThis appendix has several purposes. These are:\n\uf0b7 To provide the mathematical relationship between the Conventional\nGeocentric Celestial Reference System (GCRS, an Earth-Centered Inertial\nSystem, Radio Wavelength Based, Epoch J2000.0), the Celestial Intermediate\nOrigin (CIO), the Terrestrial Intermediate Origin (TIO) and a Conventional\nTerrestrial Reference System (TRS) as they relate to the World Geodetic\nSystem 1984 (WGS 84). The CIO-based expressions for the IAU 2006/2000A\nprecession-nutation model have too many terms for complete representation\nhere; however, auxiliary files provide the complete set of necessary terms,\nsoftware provided by the IERS can be used to verify implementation of these\nmodels;\n\uf0b7 To provide specific guidance to implement the coordinate transformation\npresented in the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service\n(IERS) 2010 Conventions Technical Note 36 (TN36) [1]. This guidance is\nrequired to ensure a consistent coordinate transformation implementation\nacross the various DoD programs. Guidance is provided on the application of\nthe NGA-generated, Earth Orientation Parameter Predictions (EOPP), in this\ncoordinate transformation procedure. Note that changes are planned for the\nEOPP that are consistent with TN36; however, these changes will not be\nA-2\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nimplemented until further coordination with all DoD components is complete.\nUntil that time, users should reference [12]; and\n\uf0b7 To discuss and provide the numerical data needed to transform position and\nvelocity components from the Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame (CRF),\nthe realization of the GCRS, or Earth-Centered-Inertial (ECI) Coordinate\nSystem to the WGS 84 Terrestrial Reference Frame (TRF), a realization of an\nEarth-Centered-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) TRS.\nThe CRF (ECI) to WGS 84 TRF (ECEF) transformation makes use of the International\nAstronomical Union (IAU) 2006 precession theory, the IAU2000 nutation theory, the\ndefinition of universal time, and the CIO-based transformation adopted by the IAU and as\ndocumented in [1].\nDefinition of terms and background\nThroughout this appendix the following definitions and conventions apply. The\ndefinitions are taken largely from [1].\nBarycentric Celestial Reference System (BCRS) - a system of space-time\ncoordinates within the framework of General Relativity with metric tensor specified by\nthe IAU centered at the solar system barycenter.\nCelestial Intermediate Origin (CIO) - origin for right ascension on the intermediate\nequator in the Celestial Intermediate Reference System. It is the non-rotating origin in the\nGCRS that is recommended by the IAU.\nCelestial Intermediate Pole (CIP) - geocentric equatorial pole defined as the\nintermediate pole in the transformation from the GCRS to the International Terrestrial\nReference System (ITRS), separating nutation from polar motion. Its GCRS location\nresults from (i) the terms of precession-nutation formulation with periods greater than 2\ndays, (ii) the retrograde diurnal part of polar motion including the free core nutation\n(FCN), and (iii) the frame bias. Its ITRS location results from (i) the part of polar motion\nwhich is outside the retrograde diurnal band in the ITRS and (ii) the motion in the ITRS\ncorresponding to nutations with periods less than 2 days. The motion of the CIP is\nrealized by the IAU precession-nutation plus time-dependent corrections provided by the\nIERS (celestial pole offsets).\nCelestial Intermediate Reference System (CIRS) - geocentric reference system\nrelated to the GCRS by a time-dependent rotation taking into account precession-\nnutation. It is defined by the intermediate equator (of the CIP) and CIO on a specific date.\nIt is similar to the system based on the true equator and equinox of date, but the\nequatorial origin is at the CIO.\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC) - measure of time that is the basis of all civil\ntimekeeping\nEarth Rotation Angle (ERA) - angle measured along the intermediate equator of the\nCelestial Intermediate Pole (CIP) between the Terrestrial Intermediate Origin (TIO) and\nthe Celestial Intermediate Origin (CIO), positively in the retrograde direction.

It has no residual rotation with regard to the Earth\u2019s surface, and the\ngeocenter is understood as the center of mass of the whole Earth system, including\noceans and atmosphere. For continuity with previous terrestrial reference systems, the\nfirst alignment was close to the mean equator of 1900 and the Greenwich meridian.\nJ2000.0 - defined in the framework of General Relativity by IAU as being the epoch at\nthe geocenter and at the date 2000 January 1.5 TT = Julian Date 245 1545.0 TT.

[2]\nnon-rotating origin (NRO) - in the context of the GCRS or the ITRS, the point on the\nintermediate equator such that its instantaneous motion with respect to the system (GCRS\nor ITRS as appropriate) has no component along the intermediate equator (i.e. its\ninstantaneous motion is perpendicular to the intermediate equator). It is called the CIO\nand TIO in the GCRS and ITRS, respectively.\npolar motion - the motion of the Earth\u2019s rotation axis with respect to the ITRS. The\nmain components are the Chandlerian free motion, with a period of approximately 435\ndays, and an annual motion. It also includes sub-daily variations caused by ocean tides\nand periodic motions driven by gravitational torques with periods less than two days.\nSub-daily variations are not included in the values distributed by the IERS, and are\ntherefore to be added, after interpolation to the date of interest, using a model provided\nby the IERS Conventions[1].\nprecession-nutation - the ensemble of effects of external torques on the motion in\nspace of the rotation axis of a freely rotating body, or alternatively, the forced motion of\nthe pole of rotation due to those external torques. In the case of the Earth, a practical\ndefinition consistent with the IAU 2000 resolutions is that precession-nutation is the\nmotion of the CIP in the GCRS, including FCN and other corrections to the standard\nmodels: precession is the secular part of this motion plus the term of 26000-year period\nand nutation is that part of the CIP motion not classed as precession.\nTerrestrial Intermediate Origin (TIO) - non-rotating origin of longitude\nrecommended by the IAU in the ITRS.

It is related to the ITRS by\npolar motion and the TIO locater, s\u2032. It is related to the Celestial Intermediate Reference\nSystem by a rotation of ERA around the CIP, which defines the common z-axis of the\ntwo systems.\nA-5\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nterrestrial reference frame (TRF) - realization of the Terrestrial Reference System\n(TRS), through the realization of its origin, orientation axes and scale, and their time\nevolution.\nterrestrial reference system (TRS) - a Terrestrial Reference System (TRS) is a\nspatial reference system co-rotating with the Earth in its diurnal motion in space.\nTerrestrial Time (TT) - a coordinate time whose mean rate is close to the mean rate\nof the proper time of an observer located on the rotating geoid. At 1977 January 1.0 TAI\nexactly, the value of TT was 1977 January 1.0003725 exactly. TT may be used as the\nindependent time argument for geocentric ephemerides. An accurate realization of TT is\nTT(TAI)=TAI+32.184 seconds. In the past TT was called terrestrial dynamical time\n(TDT).\nUT1 - angle of the Earth\u2019s rotation about the CIP axis defined by its conventional\nlinear relation to the Earth rotation angle (ERA). It is related to Greenwich apparent\nsidereal time through the ERA (see equation of the origins). It is determined by\nobservations, and can be obtained from UTC by using the quantity UT1\u2212UTC, which is\nprovided by the IERS.\n(UT1\u2212UTC) - difference between the UT1 parameter derived from observation and\nthe time scale UTC, the latter being currently defined as UTC = TAI + n, where n is an\ninteger number of seconds, such that |UT1- UTC | < 0.9 seconds.\nIn the following, all coordinate systems are right-handed and orthogonal and positive\nrotations are counterclockwise.

Time and Epochs\nThere are various systems based on the diurnal rotation of the Earth that are of interest\nhere, including sidereal time, Julian date, terrestrial time, solar or universal time.\nSidereal time is realized by observations of the Earth\u2019s rotation angle with respect to\nA-6\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\ncelestial objects, particularly extragalactic radio sources (such as quasars and active\ngalactic nuclei). In these observations, consideration must be given to the effects of polar\nmotion. Mean solar time is associated with a mean fictitious sun that moves along the\ncelestial equator with a uniform sidereal motion approximately commensurate with the\nmean rate of the annual motion of the true sun along the ecliptic. If the hour angle of the\nmean sun is referred to the BIH-defined Zero Meridian, the resulting time is called\nuniversal time (UT). Universal and sidereal time, like other rotation based times, are\naffected by the irregularities in the rotation of the Earth. These irregularities take the\nform of polar motion (variations in the position of the Earth\u2019s rotation axis with respect to\nthe earth\u2019s crust), and variations in the Earth\u2019s angular rotation rate.\nThe time scale distributed by most broadcast time services is coordinated universal\ntime (UTC). It is based on the redefined coordinated universal time, which differs from\ninternational atomic time (TAI), another time scale, by an integral number of seconds.\nThe TAI time scale is the most precisely determined time scale available, and results\nfrom the analyses by the BIH of data from the atomic time standards of many supporting\ncountries. Another time scale associated with TAI is terrestrial time (TT); TT =\nTAI+32.184 seconds.\nUniversal time (UTC), is maintained to within 0.90 second of UT1 through the\nintroduction of one second time steps (called leap seconds) when necessary. Universal\nand sidereal time are equivalent time systems since UT1 is formally defined by an\nequation which relates it to mean sidereal time (MST).\nOn any given date, a star\u2019s or source\u2019s computed apparent position, upon which its\ncontribution to the UT1 determination depends, is a function not only of its\u2019 catalog\nposition and proper motion, but also of the adopted theory of precession, astronomical\nnutation, aberration, etc. Therefore, a change from one celestial inertial system (CIS) to\nanother and changes in the values of astronomical constants have complex and subtle\neffects on the value of UT1. For the current GCRS, Greenwich mean sidereal time,\nwhich is related to the equinox, can be expressed as a function of the Earth rotation angle\n(ERA) which is a function of UT1. These relationships are developed in Section 3.3.\nThe unit of time, T, in the formulas for precession and astronomical nutation is the\nJulian Century of 36525 days. Since the Julian Day begins at noon, the time interval in\nthe GCRS-to-TRS transformation to be discussed later is Julian Centuries measured from\n2000 January 1.5.\nThe time parameter t, used in all of the following expressions, is defined by\nt = (TT - 2000 January1d 12h TT) in days / 36525 (A-2)\nwhere t is in centuries. Note that 2000 January 1.5 TT = Julian Date 2451545.0 TT.\nA-7\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n3.

ERA(t) is defined as [1,\nSection 5.5.3]\nERA(T ) = 2\u03c0(UT1 Julian day fraction + 0.7790572732640 + 0.00273781191135448T ).\nu u\n(A-16)\nwhere\n= (Julian UT1 date - 2451545.0)\nand UT1 Julian day fraction is the fractional part of a Julian day with\nUT1= UTC + (UT1-UTC)\nThe Earth orientation parameter UT1-UTC must be observed.

The restoration of zonal tides should be\nconsistent with the NGA\u2019s usage based on [1, Table 8.1]. Similarly, the application of\nthe diurnal and semi-diurnal ocean tides should be consistent with NGA\u2019s usage\ndescribed in [1, Section 8.2].\n3.4 Polar Motion, W(t)\nThe transformation for the polar motion can be expressed as\nA-14\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\nW(t)\uf03dR (\uf02ds\uf0a2) R (x ) R(y ) (A-18)\n3 2 p 1 p\nor its transpose\nWT(t)\uf03dR (\uf02dy ) R (\uf02dx ) R (s\uf0a2)\n1 p 2 p 3\nwhere and being the \u201cpole coordinates\u201d of the CIP in the TRS and being the\n\u201cTerrestrial Intermediate Origin (TIO) locator\u201d that provides the position of the TIO\non the equator of the CIP corresponding to the kinematical definition of the \u201cnon-\nrotating\u201d origin (NRO) in the TRS when the CIP is moving with respect to the TRS\ndue to polar motion.

To use the polar coordinates, users should apply the diurnal and semi-\ndiurnal ocean tides as described in [1, Chapter 8]. The application of the diurnal and\nsemi-diurnal ocean tides should be consistent with NGA\u2019s usage based on [1, Section\n8.2].\n3.5 Reformulation of Transformation with Respect to the Rotation about the Z-\nAxis\nAs stated in Section 3.1, the transformation from the TRS to the GCRS can be\ndefined as\n[ ] ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]. (A-22)\nThis expression can be expanded as follows:\n(A-23)\n[TRS]\uf03dR (\uf02dy ) R (\uf02dx ) R (s\uf0a2) R (ERA) R (\uf02ds) R (\uf02dE) R (d) R (E) [GCRS].\n1 p 2 p 3 3 3 3 2 3\nWe can then define parameter \uf051(t) to represent the total rotation about the Z-axis,\nexcluding E parameter, as\n\uf051(t)\uf03ds\uf0a2(t)\uf02bERA(t)\uf02ds(t)\nand\nR (\uf051)\uf03dR (s\uf0a2) R (ERA) R (\uf02ds\uf0a2).\n3 3 3 3\nWe can define\n~\nWT(t)\uf03dR (\uf02dy ) R (\uf02dx ), (A-24)\n1 p 2 p\n~\nRT (t) \uf03d R (\uf051), (A-25)\n3\nand\nA-16\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n~\nQT(t) \uf03d R (\uf02dE)R (d)R (E). (A-26)\n3 2 3\nThis results in the rapidly changing terms involving rotations about the Z-axis to all\nbe in the R(t) term, the polar motion transformation reduces to the variations of the\npolar coordinates (x and y ), and the Q(t) is a simpler function of E and d. This\np p\nmeans that the position and velocity transformations now can be, respectively, written\nas\n[TRS]\uf03dWT(t)RT(t)QT(t)[GCRS] (Position) (A-27)\nand\n~ ~\uf026 ~ ~ ~ ~\n[TR \uf026 S]\uf03dWT(t)RT(t)QT(t)[GCRS]\uf02bWT(t)RT(t)QT(t)[GC \uf026 RS] (Velocity) (A-28)\nThe reformulation in this section is provided for mathematical correctness, although\n\uf051 \uf026 may insignificantly differ from ER \uf026 A in most applications.\n4. Summary of Transformations\nThe matrices previously described and the equations to compute the angles and other\nquantities required in these matrices are summarized below.

Calculation of the Moments of Inertia\n5.1 Overview\nIt is possible to determine the moments of inertia either geometrically, using only\nthe defining parameters of an ellipsoid (a, GM, \u03c9, f (using f to derive C\u00af )), or\n2,0\ndynamically using Earth gravitational model coefficients and the dynamical ellipticity.\nBoth methods are used here to determine the moments of inertia, though it is generally\naccepted that the dynamic solution is more accurate.\nB-8\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n5.2 Dynamic Moment of Inertia (C), with respect to the Z-Axis of Rotation\nFrom [17] Table 3.11 the dynamic moment of inertia C can be calculated as\n\u0305\n\u221a\n(B-31)\n5.3 Dynamic Moment of Inertia (A), with respect to the X-Axis in the Equatorial\nPlane\nFrom [17] Table 3.11 the dynamic moment of inertia A can be calculated as\n\u0305\n\u221a [( ) \u0305 ]\n\u221a (B-32)\n5.4 Dynamic Moment of Inertia (B), with respect to the Y-Axis in the Equatorial\nPlane\nFrom [17] Table 3.11 the dynamic moment of inertia B can be calculated as\n\u0305\n\u221a [( ) \u0305 ]\n\u221a (B-33)\n5.5 Geometric Moment of Inertia (C), with respect to the Z-Axis of Rotation\nFrom [17] Table 3.10 or [17](3-80) the geometric moment of inertia C can be\ncalculated as\n( \u221a )\n(B-34)\nB-9\nNGA.STND.0036_1.0.0_WGS84 2014-07-08\n5.6 Geometric Moment of Inertia (A), with respect to Any Axis in the Equatorial\nPlane\nDue to symmetry of the rotational ellipsoid, A = B, from [17](3-77).

General\nThis appendix lists the reference ellipsoids and their constants (a, f -1) associated\nwith the local geodetic datums which are tied to WGS 84 through datum transformation\nconstants and/or MREs (Appendices D, E and F).\n2. Constant Characteristics\nIn Appendix C.1, some of the reference ellipsoids have more than one semi-major\naxis (a) associated with them. These different values of axis (a) vary from one region or\ncountry to another or from one year to another within the same region or country.\nA typical example of such an ellipsoid is Everest whose semi-major axis (a) was\noriginally defined in yards. Changes in the yard to meter conversion ratio over the years\nhave resulted in five different values for the constant (a), as identified in Appendix C.1.\nTo facilitate correct referencing, a standardized two letter code is also included to\nidentify the different ellipsoids and/or their \u201cversions\u201d pertaining to the different values\nof the semi-major axis (a).\nC-2\nAppendix C.1\nReference Ellipsoid Names and Constants\nUsed for Datum Transformations*\nReference Ellipsoid Name ID Code a (Meters) f -1\nAiry 1830 AA 6377563.396 299.3249646\nAustralian National 1966 AN 6378160 298.25\nBessel 1841\nEthiopia, Indonesia, Japan and Korea BR 6377397.155 299.1528128\nNamibia BN 6377483.865 299.1528128\nClarke 1866 CC 6378206.4 294.9786982\nClarke 1880** CD 6378249.145 293.465\nClarke 1880 (IGN) CG 6378249.2 293.4660208\nEverest\nBrunei and E.

General\nThis appendix provides the details about the reference ellipsoids (Appendix C)\nwhich are used as defining parameters for the geodetic datums and systems.\nThere are 125 local geodetic datums which are currently related to WGS 84\nthrough satellite ties.\n2. Local Datum Ellipsoids\nAppendix D.1 lists, alphabetically, the local geodetic datums with their associated\nellipsoids. Two letter ellipsoidal codes (Appendix C) have also been included against\neach datum to indicate which specific \u201cversion\u201d of the ellipsoid was used in determining\nthe transformation constants.\n3. Transformation Constants\nAppendices D.2 through D.7 list the constants for local datums for continental\nareas. The continents and the local geodetic datums are arranged alphabetically.\nAppendices D.8 through D.10 list the constants for local datums which fall within\nthe ocean areas. The ocean areas and the geodetic datums are also arranged\nalphabetically.\nThe year of initial publication and cycle numbers have been provided. This\nmakes it possible for a user to determine when a particular set of transformation\nparameters first became available and if the current set has replaced an outdated set.\nA cycle number of zero indicates that the set of parameters is as it was published\nin DMA TR 8350.2, Second Edition, 1 September 1991, including Insert 1, 30 August\n1993, or that the parameters is new to this publication. A cycle number of one (or\ngreater) indicates that the current parameters have replaced outdated parameters that were\nin the previous edition. A change page is included for convenience.\nIf transformation parameter sets are updated in future editions of this publication,\nthe cycle numbers for each parameter set that is updated will increment by one.\n4. Error Estimates\nThe 1\uf073 error estimates for the datum transformation constants (\uf044X,\uf044Y,\uf044Z),\nobtained from the computed solutions, are also tabulated. These estimates do not include\nD-4\nthe errors of the common control station coordinates which were used to compute the\nshift constants.\nFor datums having four or less common control stations, the 1\uf073 errors for shift\nconstants are non-computed estimates.\nThe current set of error estimates has been reevaluated and revised after careful\nconsideration of the datum transformation solutions and the related geodetic information:\nthe intent has been to assign the most realistic estimates possible.\nD-5\nAppendix D.1\nGeodetic Datums/Reference Systems\nRelated to World Geodetic System 1984\n(Through Satellite Ties)\nLocal Geodetic Datum Associated Reference Code\nEllipsoid*\nAccra (Ghana) War Office 1924 WO\nAdindan Clarke 1880 CD\nAfgooye Krassovsky 1940 KA\nAin el Abd 1970 International 1924 IN\nAmerican Samoa 1962 Clarke 1866 CC\nAnna 1 Astro 1965 Australian National 1966 AN\nAntigua Island Astro 1943 Clarke 1880 CD\nArc 1950 Clarke 1880 CD\nArc 1960 Clarke 1880 CD\nAscension Island 1958 International 1924 IN\nAstro Beacon \u201cE\u201d 1945 International 1924 IN\nAstro DOS 71/4 International 1924 IN\nAstro Tern Island (FRIG) 1961 International 1924 IN\nAstronomical Station 1952 International 1924 IN\nAustralian Geodetic 1966 Australian National 1966 AN\nAustralian Geodetic 1984 Australian National 1966 AN\nAyabelle Lighthouse Clarke 1880 CD\nBellevue (IGN) International 1924 IN\nBermuda 1957 Clarke 1866 CC\nBioko International 1924 IN\nBissau International 1924 IN\nBogota Observatory International 1924 IN\nCampo Inchauspe International 1924 IN\nCanton Astro 1966 International 1924 IN\nCape Clarke 1880 CD\nCape Canaveral Clarke 1866 CC\nCarthage Clarke 1880 CD\nChatham Island Astro 1971 International 1924 IN\nChua Astro International 1924 IN\nCircuit (Zimbabwe) Clarke 1880 CD\nCo-Ordinate System 1937 of\nEstonia Bessel 1841 BR\nCorrego Alegre International 1924 IN\nDabola Clarke 1880 CD\nDCS-3 (Astro 1955) Clarke 1880 CD\nDeception Island Clarke 1880 CD\nDjakarta (Batavia) Bessel 1841 BR\n* See Appendix C.1 for associated constants a,f -1.\nD.1-1\nAppendix D.1\nGeodetic Datums/Reference Systems\nRelated to World Geodetic System 1984\n(Through Satellite Ties)\nLocal Geodetic Datum Associated Reference Code\nEllipsoid*\nDOS 1968 International 1924 IN\nEaster Island 1967 International 1924 IN\nEuropean 1950 International 1924 IN\nEuropean 1979 International 1924 IN\nFiji 1956 International 1924 IN\nFort Thomas 1955 Clarke 1880 CD\nGambia Clarke 1880 CD\nGan 1970 International 1924 IN\nGeodetic Datum 1949 International 1924 IN\nGraciosa Base SW 1948 International 1924 IN\nGuam 1963 Clarke 1866 CC\nGUX 1 Astro International 1924 IN\nHjorsey 1955 International 1924 IN\nHong Kong 1963 International 1924 IN\nHu-Tzu-Shan International 1924 IN\nIndian Everest EA/EC**\nIndian 1954 Everest EA\nIndian 1960 Everest EA\nIndian 1975 Everest EA\nIndonesian 1974 Indonesian 1974 ID\nIreland 1965 Modified Airy AM\nISTS 061 Astro 1968 International 1924 IN\nISTS 073 Astro 1969 International 1924 IN\nJohnston Island 1961 International 1924 IN\nKandawala Everest EA\nKerguelen Island 1949 International 1924 IN\nKertau 1948 Everest EE\nKorean Geodetic System 1995 WGS 84 WE\nKusaie Astro 1951 International 1924 IN\nL.

TRANSFORMATION CONSTANTS\nLOCAL GEODETIC DATUMS TO WGS 84\n(THROUGH NON-SATELLITE TIES)\n1. General\nThis appendix provides the details about the reference ellipsoids (Appendix C) used\nas defining parameters for the local geodetic datums which are related to WGS 84\nthrough non-satellite ties to the local control.\nThere are sixteen such local/regional geodetic datums, one region under the\nEuropean Datum 1950 (EUR-S), and two regional realizations of the Indian Datum\n(IND).\n2. Local Datum Ellipsoids\nAppendix E.1 lists, alphabetically, the local geodetic datums and their associated\nellipsoids. Two letter ellipsoidal codes (Appendix B) have also been included to clearly\nindicate which \u201cversion\u201d of the ellipsoid has been used to determine the transformation\nconstants.\n3. Transformation Constants\nAppendix E.2 lists, alphabetically, the local geodetic datums and the three special\nareas with the associated shift constants.\nThe year of initial publication and cycle numbers have been provided as a new\nfeature in this edition. This makes it possible for a user to determine when a particular\nset of transformation parameters first became available and if the current set has replaced\nan outdated set.\nA cycle number of zero indicates that the set of parameters are as they were\npublished in DMA TR 8350.2, Second Edition, 1 September 1991, including Insert 1, 30\nAugust 1993, or that the parameters are new to this publication. A cycle number of one\nindicates that the current parameters have replaced outdated parameters that were in the\nprevious edition.\nIf transformation parameter sets are updated in future editions of this publication,\nthe cycle numbers for each parameter set that is updated will increment by one.\n4. Error Estimates\nThe error estimates are not available for the datum transformation constants listed\nin the Appendix E.2.\nE-2\nAppendix E.1\nLocal Geodetic Datums and their Associated Ellipsoids\nRelated to World Geodetic System 1984\n(Through non-Satellite Ties)\nAssociated*\nLocal Geodetic Datum Reference Ellipsoid Code\nAden Clarke 1880 CD\nBeijing (Peking) 1954 Krassovsky 1940 KA\nBekaa Valley 1920 Clarke 1880 CD\nBukit Rimpah Bessel 1841 BR\nCamp Area Astro International 1924 IN\nConakry 1905 Clarke 1880 (IGN) CG\nEuropean 1950 International 1924 IN\nGunung Segara Bessel 1841 BR\nHerat North International 1924 IN\nHermannskogel Bessel 1841 BR\nIndian Everest EA\nIndian Everest EF\nMayotte Combani International 1924 IN\nOcotopeque Clarke 1866 CC\nPulkovo 1942 Krassovsky 1940 KA\nNew Triangulation of France Clarke 1880 (IGN) CG\nSt Pierre et Miquelon 1950 Clarke 1866 CC\nVoirol 1874 Clarke 1880 CD\nYacare International 1924 IN\n* See Appendix C.1 for associated constants a,f -1.\nE.1-1\nAppendix E.2\nNon-Satellite Derived Transformation Parameters\nLocal Geodetic Datums to WGS 84\nReference Ellipsoids and Parameter\nLocal Geodetic Datums Transformation Parameters\nDifferences\n4 Cycle\nName Code Name \uf044a(m) \uf044f x 10 Pub.

In such\ninstances, the WGS 72 to WGS 84 transformations listed in Table G.1 can be used with\nthe following equations to obtain WGS 84 coordinates for the sites:\n\uf066 = \uf066 + \uf044\uf066\nWGS84 WGS72\n\uf06c = \uf06c + \uf044\uf06c\nWGS84 WGS72\nh = h + \uf044h\nWGS84 WGS72\n. As indicated in Table G.1, when proceeding directly from WGS 72 coordinates to\nobtain WGS 84 values, the WGS 84 coordinates will differ from the WGS 72 coordinates\ndue to a shift in the coordinate system origin, a change in the longitude reference, a scale\nchange (treated through \uf044r) and changes in the size and shape of the ellipsoid. In\naddition, it is important to be aware that \uf044\uf066, \uf044\uf06c, and \uf044h values calculated using Table\nG.1 do not reflect the effect of differences between the WGS 72 and WGS 84 EGMs and\ngeoids. The following cases are important to note:\nTable G.1 equations are to be used for direct transformation of Doppler-\nderived WGS 72 coordinates. These transformed coordinates should agree to within\napproximately +2 meters with the directly surveyed WGS 84 coordinates using\nTRANSIT or GPS point positioning.\nTable G.1 should not be used for local satellite geodetic stations whose\nWGS 72 coordinates were determined using datum shifts from [37]. The preferred\napproach is to transform such WGS 72 coordinates, using datum shifts from [37], back to\ntheir respective local datums, and then transform the local datum coordinates to WGS 84\nusing Appendices D or E.\n.

    "original_comment": "As per NGA.STND.0036, the Department of Defense is required to maintain WGS 84, the best global geodetic reference system for the Earth available at this time for practical applications of mapping, charting, geopositioning, and navigation. Currently the Joint Chiefs of Staff for Intelligence (J2) are working to codify the importance of WGS 84 for global safety of navigation and national security in a letter to be published later this year.\n\nSince the construction and maintenance of WGS 84 is explicitly defined in several government standards and Standard Implementation Guidance (SIG) documents, there is no ability for NGA employees to make political decisions to impact this key governmental product.\n\nOPM-2025-0004-0001 in its current format makes no mention of an exemption for analysts working the WGS 84 mission and workers would in fact likely be caught up in the definition \u201cbeing held accountable for the success of one or more specific programs or projects\u201d.\n\nSince WGS 84 is explicitly a non-political program necessary for global navigation, OPM-2025-0004-0001 needs to be amended to provide an exemption for all workers who may meet the definitions of Schedule F as described in the document.\n\nPlease consult the J2 for further clarifications to this comment.\n",

Wouldn't this new proposal simply enforce the idea that any employee that falls under the Schedule Policy/Career simply carry out the task at hand, even if that task is counter to the constitution? And, doesn't that place the employee into a situation where either they comply, so as to keep their job, or failing to do so, get fired anyways?\n\nAI's response:\nYou raise valid and critical concerns regarding the potential implications of the OPM\u2019s proposed rule.\n\nAddressing Symptoms vs. Root Causes: You are correct to point out that the threat of removal primarily addresses the symptoms of poor performance \u2013 the outward manifestation \u2013 rather than the underlying causes. Factors such as inadequate training, unclear expectations, lack of resources, or systemic issues within the agency are not directly addressed by simply increasing the ease of removal. The OPM\u2019s argument assumes that accountability will inherently drive improvement, but it doesn\u2019t account for situations where improvement is hindered by factors beyond the employee\u2019s control.\n\nConstitutional Concerns & Compliance: Your second point is particularly significant. The proposed rule does create a situation where employees in Schedule Policy/Career positions may face a strong incentive to comply with directives, even if they believe those directives are unconstitutional or unlawful. The reduced protections and ease of removal effectively place these employees in a precarious position: comply and keep their job, or object and risk termination. This raises serious concerns about the potential for abuse of power and the erosion of ethical safeguards within the federal government. The OPM\u2019s assertion that these employees are expected to \u201cfaithfully implement administration policies\u201d is open to interpretation and could be construed as prioritizing loyalty over legal and ethical obligations.\n\nThese concerns highlight a potential trade-off between accountability and the protection of constitutional principles and ethical conduct. The OPM\u2019s argument focuses heavily on the need for efficient governance and implementation of the President\u2019s agenda, but it appears to give less weight to the potential risks of creating a workforce that may be reluctant to challenge questionable directives.\n***End of Response***\n\nSo, we may want to either strengthen or better define the act of \u201cfaithfully implement administration policies\u201d and clarify if employees should still be expected to raise concerns over legal and or ethical obligations.

By proposing to convert up to 50,000 career civil servants into political appointees, it would be the most sweeping politicization of the federal workforce since the spoils system of the 19th century. This change would replace experienced, nonpartisan professionals with ideological appointees, increasing instability and reducing the consistency with which laws are implemented.\n\nEmpirical research consistently shows that politicization undermines government performance and capacity. Studies across countries link merit-based civil services with better outcomes and lower corruption. In contrast, political appointees\u2014especially those selected for loyalty rather than expertise\u2014are associated with lower program performance and inefficiency. Frequent turnover among political appointees further weakens executive capacity, deterring career professionals from developing deep expertise and contributing to a growing human capital crisis in the federal workforce.\n\nSchedule F would also erode accountability. Political appointees are less responsive to Congress and the public, delay FOIA responses, and foster favoritism in government contracting. The proposal prioritizes loyalty to the president over constitutional duty, undermining the checks and balances that are foundational to democratic governance.\n\nRather than modernizing the civil service, Schedule F would reverse over a century of progress. It is a blunt tool designed to politicize, not reform. For the sake of good governance, democratic accountability, and effective public service, it should be firmly rejected.",

While accountability in the civil service is a desirable end, this rule goes too far in granting personal discretion to Executive Branch leadership. By stretching the application of \"policy-making\" and \"policy-advocating\" from the Civil Service Reform Act beyond their established interpretation, it creates a vague category that can encompass almost any white-collar employee and effectively nullifies civil service protections enshrined in law by Congress. Our democratic freedoms depend on the rule of law--that government officials are fundamentally bound and guided by written standards enacted through the people's representatives. If the civil service needs to be made more accountable, it should be through legislation, not a creative reinterpretation that reverses the force of the law as written. In general, this kind of regulation erodes the accountability of the Executive Branch to implement the will of the people; specifically here, it ties civil servants to the whims of Executive Branch leaders, who can circumvent the clear written standards governing the civil service simply by drawing a largely discretionary line around whatever employees they choose. This scenario makes Federal employees less beholden to the law as written and more so to the idiosyncratic preferences of their managers. While it may entail a certain kind of accountability, it is the wrong kind for a democratic society with a government of, by, and for the people. The civil service protections are there to shield Federal employees from political winds, so they can provide consistent, expert service to the American people.

    "comment": "Please see attached PDF for comment.\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\nTo Whom It Concern: am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule titled 'Improving Performance, Accountability; and Responsiveness in the Civil Service. While I appreciate the stated of promoting government effectiveness and responsiveness, I believe this proposal would significantly undermine the integrity neutrality; and long-term functionality of the federal civil service. urge the Office of Personnel Management to reconsider and withdraw this rule for the following reasons: Erosion of Merit Principles: The proposed reclassification of certain positions risks circumventing the merit-based hiring and retention systems that are foundational to the U.S. civil service. This would open the door to favoritism, reduce fairness in personnel decisions, and weaken the institutional safeguards that ensure competence and equity The proposed rule s attempt to explain this component away can essentially be boiled down to \"we do not think it will happen; this is a wholly inadequate assurance; especially when considered alongside multiple documented instances of this administration dismissing career civil servants for political reasons Politicization of Career_Roles: The rule will blur the essential line between nonpartisan career service and political appointees by making it easier to appoint O remove individuals in policy-related positions for ideological alignment rather than objective qualifications_ While the proposed rule asserts that this administration welcomes opposing viewpoints, its action do not comport with this statement: For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has dismissed numerous career professionals who disagreed with the Secretary' s scientifically unfounded claims about vaccines and autism, and scientists at the EPA and NOAA have been removed for affirming the reality of human-induced climate change: These examples strongly suggest that career expertise is sidelined in favor of ideological conformity. Risk of Retaliatory Dismissals: Without robust due process protections, civil servants could be dismissed not for poor performance or conduct issues, but for holding views or making lawful decisions that differ from those in power: This will chill expertise and professional judgment; ultimately to the detriment of the American public. Again; the proposed rule s statement that this will not be abused is unconvincing; especially when considering that this administration has shown a demonstrated disregard to judicial orders and ethics rules, suggesting that the abuse of regulatory/administrative processes would continue t0 be a modus operandi. Drain on Institutional Knowledge: politicized turnover of seasoned professionals would deplete agencies of the expertise and continuity that allow the federal government to manage complex; long-term responsibilities Many of the advances in science, medicine, and technology were made possible due to long-serving career civil servants working for the American public across multiple administrations and in spite of political differences. Allowing for the politicization of the federal civil service (which the proposed rule will undoubtedly do) will cause an exodus of employees every four years May goals being deep\nafter a change in administration: This is bad not just for the continuity of the Federal government; but the interests of the American public as well. 5. Due Process Concerns: The rule appears to bypass procedural safeguards that are essential for fair and lawful employment decisions, serious legal and constitutional questions about employee rights and redress. Moreover; the proposed rule conflicts with existing civil service statutes and judicial precedents, increasing the likelihood of litigation and regulatory uncertainty. For example: Currently; a GS-level policy analyst cannot be removed simply for disagreeing with a political appointee must receive formal charges, evidence, and an opportunity to defend themselves before the action is final. See 5 U.S. $ 7513(a- e). This would change under the proposed rule. b. Under current senior civil servant who refuses to manipulate data for political purposes is protected from retaliation. See 5 U.S. $ 2302 (6)(1)(E) The proposed rule would place such roles into categories that do not carry these protections Under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. Federal employees who disclose evidence of waste, fraud, abuse, or illegal activity would normally have a strong legal case if fired in retaliation. If their position is reclassified into a non-protected category, those protections would be severely weakened or nullified. Additionally, it is clear that the current proposed rule has already been subverted by partisan politics, making the objective, neutral enforcement of the proposed rule deeply suspect The current proposed rule makes frequent statements that the current rule (Executive Order 14003 issued by the Biden Administration) was poorly researched, failed to consider other more important components, and that the professionals at OPM now believe that rule issued in 2024 was incorrect: This reeks of partisanship. Disruption to Operational Efficiency: High levels of turnover and a climate of political Stability and professionalism are the bedrocks of effective governance, and the removal of long-standing job protections would diminish employee confidence and reduce the sense of mission and stability that are crucial t0 effective public service. Compromise Public Service Integrity: Civil servants pledge loyalty to the Constitution; not to any particular administration: This means that federal employees are obligated to work for the public interest; not the whims of whomever is in the Oval Office. Undermining this principle damages the legitimacy and impartiality of federal institutions. The proposed rule undermines this principle by encouraging compliance with partisan directives, even when those directives conflict with public welfare. For example: HHS has recently terminated grants for cancer research; leaving patients more vulnerable. b. The FDA has reportedly scaled back food safety inspections and stopped informing the public about E. coli outbreaks_ raising They\nThe IRS has reduced access for low-income taxpayers to file for free while simultaneously easing scrutiny on wealthy tax evaders_ Efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau appear aimed at shielding corporations accountability for defrauding their customers. 8 . Negative Impacts_on Recruitment and Morale: The perception of politicized and precarious employment will deter top talent seeking federal roles. The proposed rule states that this negative is mitigated by the benefit package available to Federal employees. However; while the benefit package may be slightly better than the private sector; the amount of take-home pay that career civil servants make compared to the private sector colleagues is drastically less. The idea that top talent will leave already higher-paying jobs for a civil service position that pays less and has the same at-will employment characteristics as the job would be leaving is laughable. It also goes without saying that existing staff will feel demoralized and undervalued, further eroding government capacity_ For these reasons, I respectfully request that the Office of Personnel Management reconsider this rule in its entirety. The long-term health of the civil service, and the effectiveness of our government; depend on preserving its nonpartisan, merit-based nature_ The blatant partisanship of the proposed rule demonstrates that it is less about increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the federal workforce, and more about consolidating political control over federal agencies and employees Sincerely, S Hendoaon C.S.

    "comment": "see attached.\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: attachment_1.pdf]\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has proposed a rule that would allow the\nPresident, upon OPM\u2019s recommendation, to reclassify certain career civil servants into a new\n\u201cSchedule Policy/Career.\u201d These employees would be stripped of statutory adverse action\nprotections and placed in at-will positions. The proposed rule is unsupported by rigorous data,\nlacks a credible cost-benefit analysis, and fails to consider less extreme alternatives that could\nachieve accountability while preserving constitutional and statutory safeguards.\nI. Deficient Empirical Justification\nOPM\u2019s justification for the proposed rule rests on anecdotal supervisor perceptions and isolated\nhistorical references. It asserts, without providing systematic evidence, that adverse action\nprocedures under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4303 and 7513 \u201cmake it very difficult\u201d to remove poor performers\nor those who \u201csubvert Presidential directives\u201d (90 FR at 17182\u201317183). However, the existing\nrecord contradicts these claims.\n\u25cf A 2015 GAO report found that agencies removed over 10,000 employees for\nperformance or misconduct in FY2013 using existing Chapter 43 and Chapter 75\nprocedures. The primary obstacle cited was not legal constraint but insufficient\nmanagement support and training (GAO-15-191).\n\u25cf The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) similarly reported in 2016 that 77% of\nsupervisors believed removals for poor performance were possible if managers were\nproperly trained (MSPB, Addressing Poor Performance and Misconduct, 2016).\nIn short, the problem is not the legal framework\u2014it is implementation.\nII. Inadequate and Unsupported Cost-Benefit Analysis\nThe rule\u2019s cost-benefit analysis does not satisfy the standards of Executive Order 12866 or\nOMB Circular A-4. It omits quantifiable harms, fails to estimate long-term impacts, and offers no\ndata-driven rationale for its benefits.\nCosts OPM failed to quantify include:\n\u25cf Employee turnover costs: Studies estimate that replacing a government employee can\ncost up to 90\u2013200% of their salary when accounting for recruitment, onboarding, lost\nproductivity, and training (Cascio, 2006; Boushey & Glynn, 2012).\n\u25cf Legal and reputational risk: An increase in removals without due process will likely\nincrease wrongful termination claims and whistleblower retaliation complaints, creating\nlitigation risk.\n\u25cf Recruitment deterrence: The April 2024 rule rightly noted that reducing job security\ndeters skilled applicants, particularly those seeking mission-driven public service roles\n(89 FR 24982).\n\u25cf Loss of institutional knowledge: OPM has not valued the lost human capital when\nat-will removals are used against subject-matter experts in sensitive, technical, or policy\nroles.\nChilling effects on whistleblowing and dissenting policy analysis are also omitted.\nEmpirical literature confirms that job insecurity suppresses ethical dissent, impairs innovation,\nand reduces morale (Miceli, Near, & Dworkin, 2008; Kim, 2002).\nFurther research reinforcing these concerns includes:\n\u25cf Greenberg (1990) and Colquitt (2001) found that organizational justice and fair\nprocesses significantly predict employee engagement and discretionary effort.\n\u25cf Moynihan & Pandey (2007) demonstrated that fairness and merit-based systems\nincrease public service motivation and agency performance.\n\u25cf Pfeffer (1998) showed that job security and employee investment correlate with superior\norganizational outcomes across sectors.\n\u25cf Ingraham & Ban (1998) argued that politicized or insecure work environments diminish\nperformance in public agencies.\n\u25cf Leventhal (1980) emphasized that procedural fairness is vital to legitimacy and\ncompliance in organizational contexts.\nBy ignoring these findings, OPM undercuts its claim that the proposed rule would improve\n\u201caccountability\u201d or \u201cefficiency.\u201d\nIII. Failure to Consider Reasonable Alternatives\nThe proposed rule fails to explore less disruptive approaches. It assumes that due process\nprotections and performance accountability are incompatible, but this is a false dichotomy.\nReasonable alternatives OPM should have analyzed include:\n\u25cf Streamlining internal MSPB processes for faster adjudication of adverse actions;\n\u25cf Expanded supervisory training and mentoring, as recommended by GAO and MSPB;\n\u25cf Continued implementation of the 2024 rule (89 FR 24982), which clarified procedures for\nmoving positions while preserving appeal rights;\n\u25cf Narrow exceptions or expedited processes for bona fide national security or confidential\nroles, rather than a sweeping new Schedule.\nThe 2024 final rule was adopted after a comprehensive review of public comment, precedent,\nand legal authority. It achieved reform within the merit system framework and should remain the\noperative policy.\nIV. Conclusion\nThe 2025 proposed rule is inconsistent with administrative law principles, civil service history,\nand best practices in personnel management. It lacks evidence, economic rigor, and respect for\nthe statutory merit system. OPM should withdraw the proposal and preserve the integrity of the\ncareer civil service as envisioned by Congress, reinforced by decades of bipartisan legislation,\nand affirmed by the American public.\n\n\n",

It may be wise to either reconsider / address, or at the very least, strength the OPM\u2019s argument that the President should have unlimited and unrestricted control, (ie: without legal oversight), if future legal challenges wish to be prevented. \n\nFurther insight:\nHuman:\nAre there any legal arguments against OPM's new proposal?\n\nAI\u2019s Response:\nYes, there are several potentially strong legal arguments against the OPM\u2019s proposed rule. Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n1.\tDue Process Violations (Fifth Amendment): The most significant challenge centers on due process. Removing MSPB appeal rights for Schedule Policy/Career employees arguably violates their Fifth Amendment right to due process. While the government has some leeway in regulating employment, completely eliminating the ability to challenge adverse actions could be deemed unconstitutional.\n2.\tAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) Violations: Critics could argue that OPM did not adequately justify the rule under the APA, particularly regarding the significant change in employee rights. The APA requires agencies to provide a reasoned explanation for their actions, and opponents could argue that OPM\u2019s rationale is insufficient or relies on flawed assumptions.\n3.\tSeparation of Powers Concerns: Some legal scholars argue that the rule encroaches on the authority of Congress, which has the power to establish the rules governing the civil service. By unilaterally altering employee rights, OPM may be exceeding its delegated authority.\n4.\tStatutory Conflicts (5 U.S.C. Chapter 75): The existing statutory framework governing adverse actions (Chapter 75 of Title 5) provides significant protections for federal employees. Opponents could argue that the rule effectively nullifies those statutory protections for Schedule Policy/Career employees, creating a conflict.\n5.\tFirst Amendment Concerns: If the rule is used to retaliate against employees for exercising their First Amendment rights (e.g., speaking out against government policies), it could be challenged as unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.\n6.\tViolation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978: This Act established the MSPB and aimed to protect federal employees from political interference. The proposed rule could be seen as undermining the core principles of the Act.\n7.\tArbitrary and Capricious Standard (APA): Opponents could argue the rule is \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d under the APA, meaning it lacks a rational basis or is not supported by substantial evidence. The reliance on assumptions about improved performance and reduced litigation could be challenged as unsupported.  (Human side note: Paradoxically, the lack of due process could increase legal challenges, based on constitutional claims.)\n8.\tEqual Protection Concerns (Fourteenth Amendment): If the rule is applied in a discriminatory manner, it could violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThese legal challenges are not guaranteed to succeed, but they represent significant hurdles that the OPM would need to overcome if the rule were to be implemented and subsequently challenged in court. The outcome would likely depend on the specific facts of any case and the interpretation of the courts.\n***End of AI Response***\n\nHuman:\nDoesn't the OPM argue that their understanding of all rules and laws now suggests that it's up to the president of the United States, and therefore not arbitrary or capricious?\n\nAI\u2019s response:\nYou are absolutely correct to identify that as a core element of the OPM\u2019s justification. They do heavily rely on the argument that the President has broad authority over Schedule C and now, by extension, Schedule Policy/Career positions, and therefore any actions taken under this authority are not arbitrary or capricious.\nHere's how that argument manifests in the document:\n\u2022\tExecutive Order Reliance: The OPM repeatedly emphasizes the basis of the rule in Executive Orders 13957 and 14171, framing these orders as legitimate exercises of presidential authority.\n\u2022\tPresidential Discretion: They assert that the President has the discretion to determine which positions are \u201cpolicy-determining\u201d or \u201cpolicy-making\u201d and therefore appropriate for Schedule Policy/Career.\n\u2022\tRejection of Prior Interpretations: The OPM effectively argues that prior interpretations of the law limiting presidential control over these positions were incorrect. They suggest that a more deferential view of presidential authority is now warranted.\n\u2022\t\u201cNot Arbitrary or Capricious\u201d Claim: By asserting that the President has broad discretion, they implicitly argue that any decisions made under this authority\u2014including designating positions and removing employees\u2014cannot be considered arbitrary or capricious, even if they are controversial.\nHowever, this argument is itself open to challenge. Critics could argue:\n\u2022\tStatutory Limits: That Congress has placed limits on the President\u2019s ability to create excepted service schedules and remove employees.\n\u2022\tDelegation Doctrine: That the President has improperly delegated legislative authority to themselves by broadly defining \u201cpolicy-determining\u201d positions without clear statutory guidance.\n\u2022\tAbuse of Discretion: That even if the President has discretion, that discretion is not unlimited and can be reviewed if it is exercised in a manner that is demonstrably unreasonable or violates constitutional principles.\nIn essence, the OPM is attempting to establish a legal framework where presidential control over Schedule Policy/Career positions is paramount, effectively shielding those actions from judicial scrutiny under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. Whether this argument will succeed is a key legal question.\n***End of AI Response***\n\nIt may be helpful to avoid future legal challenges to address how the 1st, 5th, and or 14th amendment may or may not apply to Federal careerists, especially those that would fall under the Schedule Policy/Career category.  It's simply not enough to suggest that \"ahh, I'm sure their boss won't fire them without cause; there's no possible way this could ever be abused...\" Otherwise, legal challenges will present themselves most assuredly. Only, in this case, without the MSPB, these new legal claims will take up the time of the lower and higher courts. \n***END OF Public Comment***\n\n",

    "comment": "I am writing to express strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) proposed rule OPM-2025-0004-0001, which seeks to reclassify approximately 50,000 federal employees into a newly designated Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) category. This proposal, a revival of the previously rescinded Schedule F, threatens the foundational principles of a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service and poses significant risks to the integrity, efficiency, and accountability of federal operations.\n\nErosion of Merit-Based Protections\n\nThe cornerstone of the federal civil service is its commitment to merit-based hiring and retention, ensuring that employment decisions are grounded in qualifications and performance rather than political affiliation. By reclassifying positions into Schedule P/C, the proposed rule would strip affected employees of critical protections against arbitrary dismissal, effectively making them at-will employees. This undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was enacted to prevent politicization and ensure a competent and impartial federal workforce.\n\nIncreased Risk of Politicization\n\nThe reintroduction of Schedule P/C opens the door to replacing experienced, nonpartisan professionals with individuals selected for their political loyalty rather than expertise. Such a shift could compromise the objectivity of policy analysis and implementation, leading to decisions that serve partisan interests over the public good. The National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE) has rightly noted that this move \"opens the door to replacing nonpartisan, professional civil servants with political loyalists\".\n\nUndermining Institutional Knowledge and Continuity\n\nFederal agencies rely on the institutional knowledge and continuity provided by career civil servants. Reclassifying positions and removing job protections could lead to a loss of experienced personnel, disrupting agency operations and diminishing the government's ability to effectively serve the public. The potential for mass dismissals based on political considerations threatens the stability and effectiveness of federal programs.\n\nLegal and Ethical Concerns\n\nThe proposed rule raises serious legal and ethical questions. The previous iteration, Schedule F, faced legal challenges and was ultimately rescinded due to concerns about its legality and potential for abuse. Reintroducing a similar framework disregards these concerns and may once again lead to protracted legal battles, diverting resources and attention from the government's primary responsibilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed reclassification of federal positions into Schedule Policy/Career represents a significant departure from the principles that have long safeguarded the integrity and effectiveness of the federal workforce. It threatens to politicize the civil service, erode merit-based protections, and disrupt the continuity of government operations. I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule and instead focus on strengthening the existing merit-based system that ensures a competent, impartial, and stable federal workforce.",
