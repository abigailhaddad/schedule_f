    "comment": "this is a terrible idea. The underlying logic of this proposal is that, 1) all federal employees, no matter where they are located or what they do, must first and foremost be loyal to the President. This is, of course, patently ridiculous. 2) It implies that anyone can do any Federal employee's job; there is no requirement for institutional knowledge or specialization, or years of experience. This, too, is patently ridiculous. Federal employees hold positions ranging from lower-level (security guards and janitors, for example) to highly educated and experienced roles (research scientists and administrators). In any of these roles, Federal employees need to first perform the duties of the position to the level expected in their performance documents. As part of that review process, they should not be working against the government, no matter who the President is at the time. However, allegiance to that President above all else, as implied here, is UNAMERICAN and ACONSITUIONAL.\n\nIf implemented, it would move us further into authoritarianism with Federal employees whose allegiance, rather than skill, earns them employment. It would weaken services and disrupt our national security. None of this improves Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service; rather, it would destroy the Civil Service.",

Under \"at-will\" employment, no reason is required for termination. And, there is little recourse for appeal. \n\nUS civil servants are not political appointees and as such are not subject to removal by Presidential authority. The Civil Service was established to create a professional, non-partisan workforce rather than one based on cronyism. Fealty to the President and his agenda should never be a condition of civil service employment and yet, this is exactly what this proposed regulation seeks to establish. The regulation authors say the reclassification will make it easier to fire employees for \"intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\" This is moving our government further in the direction of a dictatorship. This reclassification effort is a huge over-reach by the Executive Branch which will undermine the federal workforce and reduce public trust in government. \n\nAnother reason given for changing civil servants to at-will employees is that the current protections employees enjoy (e.g., a fair workplace) purportedly makes it difficult \"to hold employees accountable.\" If that is the case, improve the evaluation system. \n\nThe drafters of this rule assert that \"positions will remain career jobs filled on a non-partisan basis.\" This is a disingenuous claim. At-will employment undermines career employment. Job security and due process for employees are critical assurances to those who seek a career job in the federal government. These do not rule out a robust training and evaluation program to ensure good job performance. \n\nIn addition, the assertion that one can be fired without due process for \"intentionally subverting Presidential directives\" undermines the professional, non-partisan character of civil service positions. The message is clear. Obey or be gone. No professional person would choose to work under such conditions. Our government has long upheld model employment regulations.

    "comment": "I am a private individual strongly opposing the Office of Personnel Management’s proposed regulation – [Docket ID OPM-2025-0004] RIN 3206-AO80.\n\nThe stated reason for the proposed rule is to “allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or . . .  intentionally [subvert] Presidential directives.”  (Summary 90 FR 17182)  However, this appears to be a thinly disguised effort to impose a “loyalty to President Trump test” for federal employees and fire those employees who are considered not sufficiently loyal to the President.  \n\nThe proposed rule may give “lip service” to the E.O. 14171 “directive” that an employee is “not required to pledge personal loyalty to the President or his policies” (Section 213.3501  90 FR 17201), however, if that employee is classified as “at will” and is fired because, for example, he or she is registered to a political party other than the one currently in office, how does that employee fight that wrongful termination?\n\nThe Summary states that “[a]gency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct.” (Summary 90 FR 17182).  There is no cite supporting that assertion.  And while making the process easier for supervisors to take adverse actions for employee misconduct may be a worthwhile objective, reclassifying employees in order to strip them of employees’ appeal rights is not logical and from what I have read may not be lawful. The December 2016 publication “Addressing Misconduct in the Federal Civil Service: Management Perspectives”  states at page 3: \n\n“Ultimately, what the survey data indicate is that there is some disagreement among supervisors about how many rights the system should provide to employees, including the desired extent of appeal and grievance rights. But, there is little disagreement on one crucial point – supervisors overwhelmingly want a merit-based system where employees are protected from managers who either make mistakes or act in bad faith. “\nhttps://www.mspb.gov/studies/researchbriefs/Addressing_Misconduct_in_the_Federal_Civil_Service_Management_Perspectives_1363799.pdf   \n\nThe proposed rule does not address the problem of underperforming employees.  Quoting from the OPM Rule “Upholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles”  [Docket ID: OPM-2023-0013]  RIN 3206-AO56 :\n\n“[T]he characteristics of an employee's job—including whether the employee works on policy—has nothing to do with an employee's performance. Schedule F sought to streamline terminations based on the type of work that an employee performs, not based on how well the employee performs. It is therefore difficult to understand how Schedule F can be reconciled with its purported aim of addressing poor performance.”  89 FR 24995\n\nIn my opinion it is not “difficult to understand” how reclassification addresses poor performance, it makes no rational sense whatsoever.  \n\nI am 74 years old and retired.  I receive Social Security based on my 40 years of work and rely on Medicare for health insurance coverage.  It is very important to me that the Social Security Administration employs reliable, knowledgeable employees and that human beings in the office are accessible by telephone, in person and online.  \n\nI have always paid my taxes and believe that it is a responsibility of everyone who lives in this country to pay his or her fair share of taxes.  I rely on the Internal Revenue Service to promptly review my annual returns and promptly issue whatever refund I may be entitled to.  It is important to me that the I.R.S. be fully staffed with reliable, knowledgeable employees.\n\nAs I age, I recognize more and more how important scientific and medical research is for the health of my children and grandchildren.   My family and I will be adversely affected if research is slowed into preventative and curative therapies for respiratory viruses and infections, stroke recovery, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases and conditions that directly impact my life.  I rely on the Department of Health and Human Resources to be fully staffed with reliable and knowledgeable employees.\n\nI do not trust that the proposed rule will improve the delivery of services by expert and experienced employees.  I believe it will greatly reduce the quality of services (paid for with our taxes) provided by federal agencies.\n\n",

There is no cite supporting that assertion.  And while making the process easier for supervisors to take adverse actions for employee misconduct may be a worthwhile objective, reclassifying employees in order to strip them of employees’ appeal rights is not logical and from what I have read may not be lawful. The December 2016 publication “Addressing Misconduct in the Federal Civil Service: Management Perspectives”  states at page 3: \n\n“Ultimately, what the survey data indicate is that there is some disagreement among supervisors about how many rights the system should provide to employees, including the desired extent of appeal and grievance rights. But, there is little disagreement on one crucial point – supervisors overwhelmingly want a merit-based system where employees are protected from managers who either make mistakes or act in bad faith. “\nhttps://www.mspb.gov/studies/researchbriefs/Addressing_Misconduct_in_the_Federal_Civil_Service_Management_Perspectives_1363799.pdf   \n\nThe proposed rule does not address the problem of underperforming employees.  Quoting from the OPM Rule “Upholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles”  [Docket ID: OPM-2023-0013]  RIN 3206-AO56 :\n\n“[T]he characteristics of an employee's job—including whether the employee works on policy—has nothing to do with an employee's performance. Schedule F sought to streamline terminations based on the type of work that an employee performs, not based on how well the employee performs. It is therefore difficult to understand how Schedule F can be reconciled with its purported aim of addressing poor performance.”  89 FR 24995\n\nIn my opinion it is not “difficult to understand” how reclassification addresses poor performance, it makes no rational sense whatsoever.  \n\nI am 74 years old and retired.  I receive Social Security based on my 40 years of work and rely on Medicare for health insurance coverage.  It is very important to me that the Social Security Administration employs reliable, knowledgeable employees and that human beings in the office are accessible by telephone, in person and online.  \n\nI have always paid my taxes and believe that it is a responsibility of everyone who lives in this country to pay his or her fair share of taxes.  I rely on the Internal Revenue Service to promptly review my annual returns and promptly issue whatever refund I may be entitled to.  It is important to me that the I.R.S. be fully staffed with reliable, knowledgeable employees.\n\nAs I age, I recognize more and more how important scientific and medical research is for the health of my children and grandchildren.   My family and I will be adversely affected if research is slowed into preventative and curative therapies for respiratory viruses and infections, stroke recovery, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases and conditions that directly impact my life.  I rely on the Department of Health and Human Resources to be fully staffed with reliable and knowledgeable employees.\n\nI do not trust that the proposed rule will improve the delivery of services by expert and experienced employees.  I believe it will greatly reduce the quality of services (paid for with our taxes) provided by federal agencies.",

Chan School of Public Health. As a researcher with extensive experience in the NIH grant system, I am writing to express significant concerns regarding the section of the proposed rule that designates employees with \"substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking\" as potentially occupying \"policymaking positions\" that could be reclassified under Schedule Policy/Career.\n\nSpecific Concerns with the Proposed Rule\n\nThe proposed rule identifies grant-making as \"an important form of policymaking\" and suggests that employees with \"substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions.\" This characterization fundamentally misunderstands the scientific grant review process at agencies like NIH and NSF, which rely on scientific merit and peer review rather than political considerations.\n\nThe stated purpose of this rule is to allow agencies to \"quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\" When applied to scientific grant-making, this creates a dangerous framework that could politicize what should be an independent, merit-based process.\n\nEvidence-Based Arguments\n\nThe primacy of American scientific research in the world depends on insulating technical grant review from political influence:\n\n1. NIH and NSF grant review processes are designed to fund the most scientifically promising research through rigorous peer review. The NIH is \"arguably the most important institution shaping the rate and direction of scientific research\" with significant implications for human well-being. Even small changes to how funding is allocated could have massive effects on social welfare.\n\n2. International examples demonstrate the severe consequences when politics interferes with scientific funding decisions. Soviet biology, which had achieved peak prominence by the mid-1930s, was essentially ruined by Lysenko's politically-backed campaign against genetics (Ptushenko, Genetics, 2021). The damage was so profound that even after Lysenkoism was officially renounced in 1964, it took decades for Russian science to recover from this political interference.\n\n3. Similarly, in countries like China where \"personal relationships have affected government decisions, such as the review of scientific grants,\" scientific integrity issues have damaged progress despite massive investments (Zeng et al. Dev World Bioeth, 2010). Studies indicate that politicization of science funding leads to inefficient allocation of resources, limiting China's ability to achieve global scientific leadership commensurate with its spending (Shu et al. Minerva, 2022; Yu et al. Res Policy, 2022).\n\n4. The existing peer review system, while imperfect, provides important guardrails against bias.

Explicitly exclude scientific grant review personnel at NIH, NSF, and similar research agencies from the Schedule Policy/Career designation. Scientific merit review is a technical function, not a political one.\n\n2. Provide a clear, narrow definition of what constitutes \"substantive discretionary authority\" in grant-making that distinguishes between technical evaluation based on scientific merit (which should remain protected) and truly discretionary policy decisions.\n\n3. Add specific safeguards ensuring the independence of scientific peer review committees from political interference, including explicit protections for review panel members.\n\n4. Require transparency in any actions that would redesignate positions related to scientific grant review, including advance notice and comment periods specific to each affected role.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile improving accountability in government service is a worthwhile goal, applying at-will employment status to scientific grant-making personnel poses significant risks to American scientific leadership.

International examples demonstrate the severe consequences when politics interferes with scientific funding decisions. Soviet biology, which had achieved peak prominence by the mid-1930s, was essentially ruined by Lysenko's politically-backed campaign against genetics (Ptushenko, Genetics, 2021). The damage was so profound that even after Lysenkoism was officially renounced in 1964, it took decades for Russian science to recover from this political interference.\n\n3. Similarly, in countries like China where \"personal relationships have affected government decisions, such as the review of scientific grants,\" scientific integrity issues have damaged progress despite massive investments (Zeng et al. Dev World Bioeth, 2010). Studies indicate that politicization of science funding leads to inefficient allocation of resources, limiting China's ability to achieve global scientific leadership commensurate with its spending (Shu et al. Minerva, 2022; Yu et al. Res Policy, 2022).\n\n4. The existing peer review system, while imperfect, provides important guardrails against bias. These decisions should be made by scientific experts, not political appointees.\n\nSpecific Recommendations for Improvement\n\nI propose the following improvements to the rule:\n\n1. Explicitly exclude scientific grant review personnel at NIH, NSF, and similar research agencies from the Schedule Policy/Career designation. Scientific merit review is a technical function, not a political one.\n\n2. Provide a clear, narrow definition of what constitutes \"substantive discretionary authority\" in grant-making that distinguishes between technical evaluation based on scientific merit (which should remain protected) and truly discretionary policy decisions.\n\n3. Add specific safeguards ensuring the independence of scientific peer review committees from political interference, including explicit protections for review panel members.\n\n4. Require transparency in any actions that would redesignate positions related to scientific grant review, including advance notice and comment periods specific to each affected role.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile improving accountability in government service is a worthwhile goal, applying at-will employment status to scientific grant-making personnel poses significant risks to American scientific leadership. The independence of the scientific grant-making process from political influence has been a cornerstone of American research excellence and must be preserved.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns with this proposed rule change. In short, I think the rule change would open the civil service up to political influence at the expense of carrying out the law and serving the American taxpayers. I am a federal employee yet these views are my own and do not necessarily represent my agency. I am writing as a concerned citizen and a student of good governance, on my own time.\n\n1. The rule conflates issues around performance and conduct with those of allegiance to policy. From my experience, issues with performance revolve around doing work of poor quality, not adequately fulfilling or understanding the assignment, or otherwise acting in ways that do not serve the mission. Conduct issues concern things like consistently showing up to work late, taking excessive breaks, or acting uncooperatively with colleagues. Issues around not following allegiance to policy are another matter, and would concern things like failing to follow the law or a legal Presidential directive.\n\nI'd like to see the evidence of staff not following laws or Presidential directives. From my experience, staff carry out laws and Presidential directives regardless of whether they agree; and if they don't, they switch jobs or quit on their own. For example, some staff at my agency did not agree with the Executive Order (https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/) which led to the taking down of materials that referenced Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Among other factors, we did not see it as a good use of time. But my agency did it. Similarly, prior administrations have made requests of staff that they may have disagreed with, yet they were carried out.\n\nStaff have been trained that if we have concerns, we comply, and then complain. Historically, staff have had the option of contacting the Office of Special Counsel or Inspectors General offices if they were concerned about waste, fraud, and abuse. As such, it has been disturbing these agencies had agency heads fired so early in the administration.\n\nIf staff are slow-walking or not carrying out directives now, it would behoove the administration to figure out why there has been a change in behavior. I think it's because this administration has represented a departure from legal or democratic ways of conducting government business. For example, various Executive Orders have directed actions which many consider illegal, such as shutting down federal agencies unilaterally, even though Congress has the legal right to pass laws to create or shut down agencies. It is especially troubling now because the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches are all led by the same party, so the administration is acting outside the legal system even when it ostensibly has the support it needs.\n\n2. As for addressing poor performance and conduct, I find that agencies do not use a tool at their disposal which would make their lives much easier: Assigning another manager either to manage a poor performer (from my experience, such performers are rare), or assigning that manager to manage existing staff so the current manager can focus on the poor performer.\n\n3. As it were, the civil service protections are admittedly a double-edged sword. The same protections which protect civil servants from undue political influence -- say, fabricating or withholding data to make an administration look better -- also serve to make it difficult to remove them. However, removing these protections makes any administration vulnerable to having the next administration come in and reverse them, thus catching the protection-removing administration in its own web. It would be short-sighted for any administration to remove these protections.\n\nThank you for your consideration of my comments.\nRich Levy",

    "comment": "I oppose the proposed rule, Office of Personnal Management, Docket ID OPM-2025-0004, RIN 3206-AO80, to reclassify federal workers.  The backbone of the federal administrative system is the institutional memory and non-partisanship of civil service professionals.  To reclassify these employees as proposed by this rule will make those employees in critical positions subject to the whim of each new President and will make our federal agencies more political, not less political.  It will weaken the ability of our federal agencies to serve the needs of the public, weaken the career path which currently strengthens our federal agencies and undermine the public’s confidence in our federal agencies.  The current civil service professionals are essential to the smooth operation of our federal government.  The merit system offers sufficient means of addressing misconduct and performance issues.",

Undermining job protections for career federal workers not only destabilizes agencies but also damages public confidence in our institutions. Government employees should be able to serve the American people without fear of retaliation based on political shifts.

Please do not do this.\n\nI firmly believe that politicizing the civil workforce will harm our country. The US's civil workforce, independent FED, and ability to keep much of the government's work in capable, skilled, and nonpartisan hands have allowed the US to become an economic force, a well-respected leader, and a strong nation. Please do not destroy this by adding more political workers to the workforce. \n\nOur country needs an experienced and consistent workforce, not one that is changing with the current president. In our country, we do not have a president for life, we do not have an authoritarian leader,  and we do not have a considerable government workforce that changes every four or eight years. It is the consistency and experience that keep our government functioning well. At the very least, the reason should be that this president cannot fill all the existing political appointments; why add more? But that is not the reason that I am concerned about this proposed change in government workers. Please do not cause more instability in our country. \n\nDo not fire any more government workers. Do not reclassify any government workers. We are losing valuable expertise and skilled workers, gaining nothing in return. Do not add a Schedule F to the government. \n\nThank you.\nCorinne\n",

    "comment": "I am a scientist and a citizen who is interested in this regulation because I believe that the civil service plays an important role in our society in ensuring that the laws of the land are carried out properly. Specifically, in the context of science, I am someone who has a PhD that was funded, in part, by the National Institutes of Health. I believe that the National Institutes of Health is an institution that has played an enormous role in the success of this country, in allowing for monumental scientific discoveries to be made which are valuable on their own, in addition to contributing to the development of medication (I believe that over 99% of all drugs were developed based on information contained in an NIH funded study) and contributing to the economic activity of this country (I have seen a statistic that says that for every $1 invested into the NIH, the economy recovers $2.46). Therefore, it is important to me to ensure that the National Institutes of Health remains an organization that continues to fund excellent science, in addition to carrying out groundbreaking research within the institute itself.\n\nI would like to comment on the part of this regulation removes protections from civil servants in order to make them easier to fire. I believe that this would be a grave mistake and am opposed to this change. I believe that allowing this change to go through would remove many nonpartisan experts from our federal agencies and would replace them with political appointees. In the context of the NIH, this would be disastrous because it would remove scientists who are renowned in their fields with decades of experience and replace them with political appointees who are interested in carrying out an ideological agenda, namely censorship of research and information that they believe is hostile to right wing causes. In the last months, we have seen the haphazard way in which the National Institutes of Health has terminated many active grants, in fields such as HIV, mRNA vaccines and more. The termination of vaccine-related grants is particularly troubling to me because the skepticism of mRNA vaccines is a result of right wing misinformation and is not based on solid research. I worry that if the NIH continues not to fund many promising areas of research in order to promote a political agenda, the discovery of cures for deadly diseases like cancer and Alzheimers will be delayed. \n\nFurthermore, science is a discipline that requires a lot of training and nuance and replacing experts with novices who are not equipped to make careful scientific decisions will harm the longterm prospects of this country. I know that the rule says that fired civil servants will be replaced with nonpartisans but all of the evidence I have seen so far, does not make me trust the administration when it comes to this statement. For example, the chief of staff of the NIH Director, a position that has always been held by a scientist was recently transferred to Seana Cranston, who is not a scientist but is instead a political operative who has worked with Representative Thomas Massie and Senator Rand Paul. Furthermore, the haphazard nature of the decisions made by the NIH under the Trump administration does not give me confidence that nonpartisan scientists who are fired will be replaced by skilled experts. For example, in an attemot to defund research which is \"DEI\", many important clinical trials testing drugs for diseases like Stage 4 breast cancer have been defunded, simply because they included an LGBTQ participant within the trial. We have also heard of the cancellation of research grants involving domestic partner violence, an issue which affects many women, but which the administration deemed \"unnecessary\" for a reason that is much more likely to be political rather than scientific. \n\nLastly, I am worried that if the status of these civil servants changes to being at-will, then Trump administration officials will be able to fire these employees for speaking out against unlawful orders or acting as whistleblowers. This would severely reduce the autonomy of even nonpartisan experts to carry out their jobs and make decisions that are best for science, even if they are at odds with the wishes of the administration.\n\nTherefore, it is my recommendation that these changes not go through and that civil service protections for civil servants remain in place. \n\nThank you.",

    "comment": "Thank you for the opportunity to comment. Good managers can already document poor performers and have them removed with due process. This rule runs the risk of making the government workforce political. The last time it was mostly political was during the Harding Administration when there was rampant corruption. Hiring was changed to a merit-based system because of those scandals. Schedule F will mean the government will no longer be merit-based, and firings will happen if government workers don't close their eyes to corruption, misconduct, or reckless behavior of their superiors or peers. They may even be forced to participate in fear of being fired. In addition, there will be no long-term policy experience because government workers will change each Administration, and employees may also be too afraid to share their expertise and provide objective pros and cons of policies for decision-makers to consider. Employees generally seamlessly support new Administration's priorities but take their oath to the Constitution seriously - if it's legal, they will pivot accordingly; if it's not legal or if it's reckless, they will speak up on behalf of the American public. This is critical for transparency of the government and for the rule of law. Another point I want to make is that if one Administration creates a new office, another Administration can already easily move those employees and even have them do similar work supporting their own policies. Government workers already must choose between implementing new policies or leaving, unless they are asked to do something inappropriate in which case they should be able to freely speak. It's critical that the government workforce remain neutral and lawful and represent the public and the Constitution. Otherwise, there is the danger of a repeat of the Harding days with government employees working for political bosses rather than the American people. The lack of continuity in the workforce will be dangerous as well, especially since policies and procedures are often reinvented years later, and there will be no institutional knowledge of how to manage these changes or what the benefits and costs are.

    "comment": "Dear Office of Personnel Management:\n\nI write to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule entitled \"Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\", published on April 23, 2025. The proposal seeks to exempt a newly defined category of “Schedule Policy/Career” positions from the statutory protections of 5 U.S.C. Chapters 43 and 75, including the right to appeal adverse personnel actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). This proposal is inconsistent with governing federal statutes and exceeds the scope of executive authority.\n\n1. Statutory Protections Cannot Be Waived by Regulation\n\nCongress has clearly and intentionally established a legal framework that governs performance-based and adverse actions affecting federal employees. Under 5 U.S.C. §§ 4303 and 7513, covered employees are entitled to procedural protections, including advance notice, an opportunity to respond, and the ability to appeal to the MSPB. These protections were codified by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), which replaced earlier patchwork systems with a unified statutory framework. These rights are not discretionary, nor can they be modified or withdrawn by regulation.\n\nWhile the statute (5 U.S.C. § 7511(b)(2)) allows for the exclusion of certain positions from Chapter 75, such as political appointees or positions designated as “confidential or policy-determining,” it does not authorize the wholesale transfer of career civil service employees into newly created at-will categories through regulatory action. The authority to exclude positions from Chapter 75 is limited in scope and purpose and must be interpreted narrowly to avoid undermining Congress’s express intent.\n\n2. The Proposal Violates the Separation of Powers\n\nBy unilaterally removing procedural protections through the creation of the “Schedule Policy/Career” classification, the Executive Branch is attempting to do through regulation what Congress has expressly prohibited—removing career employees without just cause, due process, or meaningful appeal. This raises significant constitutional concerns under the separation of powers doctrine. The Executive cannot override or nullify Congressional enactments through rulemaking.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that where Congress has created a comprehensive remedial scheme (as with the CSRA), judicial and administrative bodies must follow that framework. The proposed rule contradicts this well-established principle and risks subjecting the Executive Branch to legal challenge on administrative and constitutional grounds.\n\n3. Undermining Merit System Principles\n\nThe proposed rule would have a chilling effect on the integrity and independence of the civil service. Career employees in policy-influencing roles—many of whom are technical experts or senior supervisors—would become vulnerable to arbitrary dismissal, political coercion, or reprisal for faithfully executing laws as enacted by Congress. This undermines 5 U.S.C. § 2301, which mandates that employees be retained based on performance and protected from arbitrary action and personal favoritism.\n\nRemoving these protections does not enhance accountability—it creates a workforce subject to political influence and fear, contrary to the principles that have guided the civil service for over a century.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety. The authority to alter statutory employee protections rests solely with Congress, and any attempt to circumvent that authority via regulation is unlawful and harmful to the public interest. I respectfully request that OPM reconsider this proposed rule in light of its legal and constitutional infirmities.",

It is treasonous to promote Docket ID:OPM-2025-0004. It reminds me of the way things were in East Germany when family members ratted on each other for voicing opposition to the terrorist regime there. Even Ronald Reagan worked to end such violence against free speech and democratic principles. \nNot only that, Rump's and Musk's continued attacks on the federal workers (who help all of us in the United States to enjoy the freedom to live prosperous and healthy lives) are for the purpose of making themselves even more filthy rich while the rest of Americans struggle to stay afloat especially the elderly (Many of us who vote), children, and those needing medical help. We will be voting to remove this excrement from our lives soon.\nSo, stop now. The reasons behind the Docket Resolution (OPM-2025-0004)are entirely evil. This must be ended now. Those are proposing it should be removed from their jobs and any position in the federal government immediately. I am looking forward to voting out of office anyone promoting this sick and anti-American proposal.",

While there are legitimate issues with the speed and efficacy of government employee reviews, this proposed change would turn civil servants into a fearful, closed-off, and vindictive authoritarian arm of every administration current or future. Civil service is supposed to serve ALL of the American public, not the personal desires of the president or a single political party, and once this line is crossed there is no turning back. Any administration could threaten employees and upend due process and the lawful execution of reviews and implementation of policy and law, summarily firing any opposition without due process or recourse.\n\nThe enforcement of employee standards through weaponized political directive will have a chilling effect on employees reporting harassment, illegal activity, or poor performance for fear of retribution - this proposal will not only have the opposite effect of it's stated purpose but encourage and enable corruption and unaccountability.\n\nExamples given in the \"Proposed Rule Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" fact sheet demonstrate intent to use this change for that very purpose, while using examples like as the FDIC sexual harassment case as a \"gotcha\" to make opposing this change appear to condone such behavior. Not only is such behavior reprehensible, it would be ENABLED by this rule change, which would remove review and appeals recourse for employees fired for reporting such activity by supervisors, etc.\n\nI urge OPM to consider the precedent it is setting and the implications this drastic change will have during this AND future administrations, with the full implications and due weight of turning apolitical federal employees into a weaponized arm of power for any president.\n\nIn addition, 30 days is far too short a time frame to solicit comments for such a sweeping change - I strongly urge you to extend the comment period to a minimum of 120 days.",

    "comment": "I write to oppose the proposed Schedule F classification.

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, this proposal allows politically motivated firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague criteria for classifying employees under this schedule and for firing employees who have been classified violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing the proposed schedule contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\nThe change is being justified as increasing employee accountability, but this term is not defined.  The preamble suggests that this reclassification will address poor performers within government, but does not explain how the \"at will\" status limits firing to poor performers or how the rule will address poor performance in non-policy-making positions.  The rulemaking provides several examples of employees behaving badly, but doesn't explain why existing rules and laws are insufficient to address these problems. The current system does allow federal supervisors to both fire poor performing employees and to encourage them to seek work elsewhere.   \nIn summery this change is counter to statute and ill-advised.  \n",

    "comment": "I write in strong opposition to the \"Schedule F\" classification as it threatens the merit-based civil service system that the nonpartisan federal workforce has been built upon for over a hundred years. The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 was specifically enacted to make the move from a spoils system to the current merit-based practice we have today. Reclassifying employees as Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated career actions, which flies in the face of the principles of a nonpartisan federal workforce. Specifically, I reference 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which requires federal employment decisions to be based on MERIT and be free from political influence. Given this administration's emphasis on merit-based hiring, Schedule F seems antithetical to its own priorities.\n\nAdditionally, the broad criteria used for the classification of an employee under Schedule F would also violate due process protections for career federal employees guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513. Furthermore, OPM is bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit-based civil service system principles. Enacting Schedule F runs contradictory to this statute and places political pressure on career employees, undermining the integrity and continuity of federal programs across changing administrations. \n\nSchedule F represents a substantive threat to no only civil service independence, but the law itself. I strongly encourage this administration to review the relevant statutes and laws and reject any regulatory framework that seeks to skirt these codified protections of a merit-based system. ",

    "comment": "As an employee of the Social Security Administration, Acting Commissioner Dudek intends to apply this Schedule Policy/Career classification to a wide swath of SSA employees whose duties are operational or technical — NOT political (see https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/04/dudek-calls-entire-ssa-offices-be-converted-new-schedule-f/404755/).  As one example, placing the entire Office of Disability Adjudication under this new classification poses a serious threat to the accuracy, fairness, and efficiency of the disability claims process. By reclassifying adjudicators, analysts, medical consultants, and support staff under Schedule Policy/Career, the agency undermines civil service protections and allows political influence over decisions that should be impartial and based solely on medical and legal criteria. This politicization risks inconsistent and legally questionable outcomes, damages morale, drives out experienced professionals, and delays critical benefits for disabled Americans. Such a move erodes public trust in SSA’s ability to deliver benefits fairly and lawfully, and it must not proceed to protect both the integrity of the Agency and its staff and the rights of disability claimants.",

As noted above, no evidence of the targeted employees engaging in misconduct or performing poorly has been   provided. As for   undermining democratic  processes by  subverting Presidential directives, it is clear by the number of Presidential directives that have been enjoined by the federal courts, and will soon be determined to be illegal by the courts, that it's the Presidential   directives   that  undermine the democratic process_ It is  time to call the Presidential directives what are deliberate attempt to harm  federal employees' rights and benefits and to cripple union representation Sincerely; Neil C.

    "comment": "To: Office of Personnel Management\nRe: Docket ID OPM–2025–0004 – Proposed Rule: Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\nDate: 25 April 2025\n\nDear Office of Personnel Management,\n\nI write in strong opposition to the proposed rule (OPM–2025–0004) that would reclassify federal scientists, statisticians, and other technical experts into the newly created “Schedule Policy/Career” (formerly Schedule F) category, eliminating their long-standing civil service protections.\nAs a Principal Statistician at StatCon Consulting, with over 30 years of experience in biostatistics and data science across academia, industry, and government collaborations, I am deeply alarmed that this rule would make thousands of federal employees at-will—stripping them of due process protections that are foundational to a professional, nonpartisan civil service.\n\nFederal scientists and statisticians play a critical role in ensuring that government policies are grounded in sound, unbiased evidence. Their work touches every aspect of American life—from public health, economic indicators, and climate change to education, agriculture, and civil rights enforcement. These professionals must be free to follow the facts wherever they lead. Reclassifying them as at-will employees introduces unacceptable risks of political interference, data manipulation, and suppression of inconvenient truths.\n\nCounting people, protecting public health, and assessing our economy are not partisan acts—they are civic imperatives. This rule, by making experts vulnerable to dismissal based on subjective notions of \"policy influence,\" undermines the very integrity of our federal workforce and threatens the quality and credibility of the data that inform democratic governance.\n\nMoreover, this proposed rule runs counter to the bipartisan Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018, which recognized the vital need for federal data to be collected and used without bias or undue influence. It is not difficult to foresee how this rule would chill scientific speech, reduce retention of federal talent, and erode public trust in government data and services.\nIn a time when evidence-based decision-making is more important than ever, the solution is not to weaken protections for scientists and statisticians, but to reinforce their ability to do their work without fear or favor.\nI respectfully urge you to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety.\n\nSincerely,\nJesse Canchola, MS, PStat\nPrincipal Statistician\nStatCon Consulting \n\n",

    "comment": "I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule titled *\"Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce\"* (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004-0001). Far from promoting accountability, this rule would dangerously politicize the career civil service, subverting the merit principles codified in the **Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)** and undermining constitutional protections that guard against arbitrary and politically motivated employment actions.\n\nThis proposed rule directly conflicts with the core mandates of the **CSRA (5 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq.)**, which enshrines merit system principles as the bedrock of federal employment. Section 2301(b)(8) of the CSRA specifically provides that “employees should be protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes.” The Schedule F framework contemplated by this rule would strip due process protections from potentially thousands of career civil servants—precisely the type of arbitrary, political interference the CSRA was enacted to prevent.\n\nMoreover, the rule attempts to redefine and expand the scope of \"policy-influencing positions\" without statutory authority. Congress has not delegated OPM or the Executive Branch the discretion to bypass civil service protections wholesale by executive fiat. In fact, courts have consistently held that the **nondelegation doctrine** prohibits agencies from arrogating such sweeping powers absent a clear congressional mandate (*Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns*, 531 U.S. 457 (2001)).\n\nThe proposed rule also implicates serious **Fifth Amendment due process concerns**. Federal employees in the competitive service have a constitutionally protected property interest in their continued employment. Removing their protections without individualized due process hearings violates established procedural safeguards (*Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill*, 470 U.S. 532 (1985)). A mass reclassification of career employees to an at-will status would invite widespread litigation and erode public confidence in the federal government’s commitment to constitutional norms.\n\nAdditionally, by consolidating power over hiring and firing into the hands of politically appointed agency heads, this rule raises serious **separation of powers concerns**. It blurs the line between the apolitical implementation of laws by the Executive Branch and partisan control over the machinery of government. A politicized civil service would inhibit Congress's ability to rely on nonpartisan agencies for oversight and undermine the administrative state's legitimacy—an issue the Supreme Court has warned against in cases such as *Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).\n\nThe rule proposed under Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004-0001 is not a restoration of accountability—it is an open invitation to political retaliation, ideological purges, and the dismantling of a merit-based civil service. It contravenes statutory law, violates constitutional protections, and endangers the stability and impartiality of the federal workforce. I urge OPM to reject this rule in its entirety and to stand firm in defense of the apolitical, professional civil service envisioned by the Framers and protected by Congress for over a century.",

    "comment": "I am writing in strong opposition to the proposed rule.\nThis rule is a dangerous overreach that threatens both the rule of law and the health and safety of the American people. By attempting to reclassify career civil servants into a new “Policy/Career” category, the Executive Branch is ignoring clear statutory limits set by Congress through the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Only Congress has the constitutional authority to determine the structure and protections of the civil service. Bypassing that authority not only undermines the separation of powers — a foundational principle of our democracy — but also risks eroding public trust in government institutions.\nThe proposal also strips away basic due process rights guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment. It would allow for mass dismissals of career employees without the safeguards of notice, explanation, or appeal, opening the door to political retaliation and cronyism. This is fundamentally un-American and invites constitutional challenges the government is unlikely to withstand.\nBeyond the legal violations, the human cost of this rule would be enormous. I have spent more than 40 years working in health and human services, and throughout my career, I have worked closely with many talented and dedicated federal public servants. I am deeply grateful for their professionalism, expertise, and steadfast commitment to serving the American people, regardless of political pressures. Their work has been critical to advancing public health, safeguarding vulnerable populations, and ensuring government programs function effectively and fairly.\nPoliticizing these essential roles — particularly in public health and health care — would not only diminish the quality of government services but could endanger lives. We need experienced, nonpartisan experts leading responses to disease outbreaks, regulating the safety of medicines, and administering critical programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Undermining their independence would slow emergency responses, weaken public protections, and ultimately harm the very people government is meant to serve.\nFor the sake of the Constitution, the integrity of the civil service, and the health and safety of the American people, this proposal must be withdrawn.\n",

    "comment_text": "I am writing in strong opposition to the proposed rule.\nThis rule is a dangerous overreach that threatens both the rule of law and the health and safety of the American people. By attempting to reclassify career civil servants into a new “Policy/Career” category, the Executive Branch is ignoring clear statutory limits set by Congress through the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Only Congress has the constitutional authority to determine the structure and protections of the civil service. Bypassing that authority not only undermines the separation of powers — a foundational principle of our democracy — but also risks eroding public trust in government institutions.\nThe proposal also strips away basic due process rights guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment. It would allow for mass dismissals of career employees without the safeguards of notice, explanation, or appeal, opening the door to political retaliation and cronyism. This is fundamentally un-American and invites constitutional challenges the government is unlikely to withstand.\nBeyond the legal violations, the human cost of this rule would be enormous. I have spent more than 40 years working in health and human services, and throughout my career, I have worked closely with many talented and dedicated federal public servants. I am deeply grateful for their professionalism, expertise, and steadfast commitment to serving the American people, regardless of political pressures. Their work has been critical to advancing public health, safeguarding vulnerable populations, and ensuring government programs function effectively and fairly.\nPoliticizing these essential roles — particularly in public health and health care — would not only diminish the quality of government services but could endanger lives. We need experienced, nonpartisan experts leading responses to disease outbreaks, regulating the safety of medicines, and administering critical programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Undermining their independence would slow emergency responses, weaken public protections, and ultimately harm the very people government is meant to serve.\nFor the sake of the Constitution, the integrity of the civil service, and the health and safety of the American people, this proposal must be withdrawn.",

Giving one person the choice to fire anyone in federal service without warning will only cause chaos and loss of trust in government. People that work for the government take pay cuts to work these positions because they see federal jobs as a service to their country and are excluded from being disrespectedly fired as is done in at-will (what this bill mainly is about) terminations. Losing this benefit, will harm thousands of patriots and veterans. Ethically, a nightmare. This is how we descend into the very thing our government was created to end, Tyranny. This was recently what DOGE essentially failed at but attempted. Passing this law is as un-American as siding with dictators normally would be. As a federal employee myself, I am ashamed of what has been acceptable behavior. Lies are now not only acceptable but also unquestionable and unquestioned. Of course my words will sway none of the sycophants and Family cultists, but at least I can freely write them, for now. Signing this into law takes away protections and benefits partisanship. At-will terminations are great for profits but devastating to those who serve. Shame on this whole idea of running the government like a privately owned capitalist corporation instead of a government of the people, by the people, FOR the people, because those two routes are diametrically opposed.

    "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule aimed at \"strengthening employee accountability\" by creating Schedule Policy/Career within the excepted service and removing due process protections for employees in policy-influencing positions. While the stated goals of accountability and democratic responsiveness are important, this rule, in its current form, poses significant risks to the integrity of the civil service and the principles of fairness and due process.\n\nThe removal of Chapter 43 and 75 protections, including Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeals, for a broad category of \"policy-influencing\" career employees is deeply concerning. This action would essentially create a system of at-will employment for a significant portion of the federal workforce, making them vulnerable to arbitrary or politically motivated removal without adequate recourse. The historical context provided in the proposed rule itself highlights the dangers of a purely patronage-based system, which this rule risks resurrecting in a new guise.\n\nWhile the proposal claims to maintain nonpartisan hiring for Schedule Policy/Career positions, the lack of meaningful job security and appeal rights inherently politicizes these roles. Employees in these positions would be incentivized to align themselves with the political preferences of the current administration, rather than providing objective and expert advice based on their professional expertise and the best interests of the public. This could lead to a decline in the quality and impartiality of policy recommendations and the erosion of the institutional knowledge that career civil servants provide.\n\nFurthermore, the definition of \"policy-influencing\" positions appears overly broad and lacks clear, objective criteria. This ambiguity creates the potential for the rule to be applied to a wide range of employees, extending far beyond high-level decision-makers and encompassing individuals whose roles involve technical expertise or the implementation of established policies. Subjecting these dedicated public servants to at-will employment based on such a vague definition is unjust and undermines the principles of a merit-based civil service, where career professionals are selected and retained based on their qualifications and performance, not their political leanings.\n\nThe argument that current Chapter 43 and 75 procedures are overly burdensome and impede accountability should be addressed through targeted reforms to those processes, rather than a wholesale removal of fundamental employee protections. Streamlining procedures and ensuring timely resolution of performance issues are legitimate goals, but they should not come at the cost of due process and the creation of a politicized workforce.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge OPM to reconsider this proposed rule. Instead of dismantling essential employee protections and risking the politicization of the civil service, efforts should focus on refining existing performance management systems to ensure both accountability and fairness. The creation of Schedule Policy/Career, without adequate safeguards, represents a dangerous step backward that would undermine the professionalism, independence, and effectiveness of the federal workforce.",

Making another minimum of 50,000 civil servants who were not politically appointed into political appointees is counter to the social contract inherent in the United States Civil Service. Adding loyalty tests to a civil servant's requirements is contrary to the United States Constitution. The oaths of civil servants are sworn to the Constitution, not the President nor any of the President's appointees. The United States of America is Representative Democracy, not a Monarchy, and certainly not a Dictatorship.

    "comment": "I am a retired Federal employee after 35 years of service. I am afraid that Schedule F will not be used to promote career employee accountability, but instead will be used to bypass the accepted practice and experience that exists in all Federal Agencies. Removing employees for poor performance or misconduct should be allowed, but removing agency employees who have expertise and historical knowledge about their agencies should not be subject to removal at the whim of the Executive.

    "comment": "With regard to the proposed OPM rule to politicize the civil service via the Schedule Policy/Career reclassification of federal employees, removing their civil service protections, and rendering them at-will workers, subject to illegal terminations based on baseless political preference. As a concerned American and decorated combat Veteran, I argue that the proposed rule is unlawful, procedurally deficient, and contrary to the public interest, particularly for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The rule should be withdrawn with prejudice immediately based on the following legal rational:\nFirst, it is a violation of Statutory Civil Service Protections. The proposed rule undermines the merit-based civil service system codified in Title 5 of the U.S. Code, particularly 5 U.S.C. § 2301, which mandates that federal employment be based on merit principles, free from political influence. By reclassifying employees in “policy-influencing” roles as at-will workers, the rule effectively nullifies protections against arbitrary dismissal, violating 5 U.S.C. § 7511, which guarantees adverse action procedures for competitive and excepted service employees. For VHA employees, the rule also conflicts with Title 38 protections (38 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.), which prioritize stable staffing to ensure quality veteran healthcare. The Department of Veterans Affairs’ planned reduction of 83,000 jobs, tied to this rule, risks destabilizing VHA operations, contravening Congress’s intent to prioritize veterans’ care. \n\nSecond, this rule is a violation of the Arbitrary and Capricious clause under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), agency actions must not be arbitrary or capricious. The proposed rule fails to provide a reasoned basis for reclassifying employees, relying on vague criteria for “policy-influencing” positions that lack clear standards, and are subject to the whims of political sycophants. OPM’s estimate of impacting ~50,000 employees, including VHA administrative staff, is unsupported by data demonstrating how these roles undermine agency efficiency or necessitate at-will status. The rule also ignores the chilling effect on employee morale and recruitment, particularly in VHA, where staffing shortages already impair care delivery. OPM’s failure to analyze alternatives, such as targeted performance management reforms, renders the rule arbitrary and capricious.\nThird, your insufficient comment period violates is a procedural deficiency in the Rule making process. The APA requires meaningful public participation (5 U.S.C. § 553). The 30-day comment period, ending May 23, 2025, is insufficient for a rule with such far-reaching consequences, especially given OPM’s bypassing of standard regulatory steps (e.g., declaring Biden-era protections inoperative). This curtailed process limits stakeholders, including Veterans, from fully assessing the rule’s impact. Additionally, OPM has not disclosed sufficient data on affected positions or economic impacts, violating APA transparency requirements.\nThe rule jeopardizes the public interest by politicizing the federal workforce, undermining 5 U.S.C. § 1103’s mandate for OPM to uphold merit principles. For VHA, the rule’s alignment with the VA’s August 2025 RIF threatens healthcare access for veterans, as administrative roles are critical to clinical operations. This conflicts with Congressional directives in the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to prioritize veteran services. The rule’s reliance on Project 2025’s privatization goals further suggests an intent to weaken public institutions, contrary to Congress’s commitment to a robust VA.\nAdditionally, the rule raises due process concerns under the Fifth Amendment by depriving employees of protected property interests in their jobs without adequate notice or hearing. Reclassification to at-will status, followed by potential termination without appeal rights, denies procedural protections established in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill (1985). This is particularly egregious for VHA employees with veteran status, who are entitled to hiring and retention preferences under 5 U.S.C. § 2108.\nTo conclude, your rule is blatantly unlawful, procedurally flawed, and detrimental to the federal workforce and veterans’ care. OPM should withdraw the rule or, at minimum, extend the comment period, provide detailed impact analyses, and revise the rule to comply with Title 5, Title 38, and APA requirements. I urge OPM to prioritize merit-based employment and protect VHA’s ability to serve veterans.",

    "comment": "The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 were crucial pieces of legislation that decreased political influence within the federal workforce.

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the proposed rule (OPM-2025-0004-0001) that seeks to create a new “Schedule Policy/Career” category within the federal civil service. This proposal would NOT improve performance and accountability BUT WOULD dangerously erode the merit-based foundations of the federal workforce and risks politicizing what has historically been a nonpartisan, professional civil service who only answers to the constitution NOT to a person or political party. \n\nFirst, by exempting policy-related positions from adverse action protections, the proposal would allow political appointees or new administrations to remove career employees based solely on political loyalty rather than competence or adherence to law and scientific standards. This would replace institutional knowledge, technical expertise, and continuity in governance with ideological conformity. It risks creating a workforce where federal employees are hired or fired based on their political allegiance rather than their qualifications or performance.\n\nSecond, this change would all but guarantee mass turnover in federal staffing every four years, or even more frequently, depending on shifts in executive leadership. Agencies could be emptied of experienced personnel each time the Presidency changes hands, severely disrupting essential services and the government’s ability to function consistently and impartially. This instability would harm not only internal agency operations but also the American public who rely on a stable, competent federal workforce.\n\nThird, the proposal reintroduces the worst elements of the “spoils system” that plagued American governance in the 19th century — a system the civil service reforms of the late 1800s (particularly the Pendleton Act) were explicitly designed to eliminate. The return to a patronage-based system would invite widespread abuse by the executive branch, with political loyalty prioritized over merit, expertise, and the public interest. It would undo more than a century of progress in creating a professional civil service dedicated to impartial service to the nation, not service to a particular political leader.\n\nIn short, the proposed rule would politicize federal service, destabilize agency operations, and undo critical reforms that have safeguarded the integrity of government for generations. I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw this rule in the interest of preserving a CRITICAL nonpartisan, professional, and effective civil service for the American people not beholden to a party or person!",

I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw this rule in the interest of preserving a CRITICAL nonpartisan, professional, and effective civil service for the American people not beholden to a party or person!",

Agencies could be emptied of experienced personnel each time the Presidency changes hands, severely disrupting essential services and the government’s ability to function consistently and impartially. This instability would harm not only internal agency operations but also the American public who rely on a stable, competent federal workforce.\n\nThird, the proposal reintroduces the worst elements of the “spoils system” that plagued American governance in the 19th century — a system the civil service reforms of the late 1800s (particularly the Pendleton Act) were explicitly designed to eliminate.

    "comment": "Dear Office of Personnel Management,\nI am writing to express serious concerns regarding the proposed rule to create Schedule Policy/Career positions within the excepted service. While I understand the stated goal of enhancing accountability, this rule is fundamentally flawed legally and as a matter of policy. Below, I outline specific issues related to statutory conflicts, constitutional challenges, procedural deficiencies, and broader policy implications.\n \n1. Conflict with Statutory Protections\nThe proposed rule appears to contravene several provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), which established a uniform framework for employee protections. Specifically:\n•Adverse Action Rights: By excluding Schedule Policy/Career employees from Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5, the rule strips them of procedural safeguards, including the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeal rights. This exclusion undermines Congress’s intent to provide federal employees with due process and fair treatment, as affirmed in cases like United States v. Fausto (484 U.S. 439 [1988]).\n•Merit System Principles: The merit system principles enshrined in Title 5, Section 2301(b), emphasize nonpartisan retention based on performance. Converting these roles into at-will positions risks politicization, directly contravening these principles.\n \n2. Constitutional Concerns\n•Fifth Amendment – Due Process: The removal of appeal rights infringes upon employees’ constitutional property interests in their jobs, as recognized in Arnett v. Kennedy (416 U.S. 134 [1974]). This lack of due process poses significant constitutional challenges.\n•First Amendment – Free Speech: Creating at-will positions could have a chilling effect on employees’ ability to express dissenting or critical views, even outside their professional duties. Such policies risk violating precedents like Pickering v. Board of Education (391 U.S. 563 [1968]), which protect employees’ rights to free expression.\n \n3. Violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\n•Lack of Rational Basis: The rule's justification relies on anecdotal evidence rather than a robust analysis of systemic challenges. The cited difficulties in addressing poor performance and misconduct are not substantiated with comprehensive data, falling short of the APA’s requirement for reasoned decision-making (Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29 [1983]).\n•Arbitrary and Capricious Action: The rule’s sweeping changes ignore less intrusive alternatives for addressing performance issues. This lack of proportionality may render the rule arbitrary under the APA.\n•Insufficient Public Engagement: If comments are inadequately addressed or the decision appears predetermined, it could lead to procedural violations, further invalidating the rule.\n \n4. Policy Implications\n•Undermining Nonpartisanship: Federal employment is merit-based, a cornerstone of public trust in government. This rule risks politicizing critical roles by allowing terminations based on subjective evaluations, which could erode that trust.\n•\tImpact on Workforce Morale and Recruitment: Moving key positions to at-will status may create a culture of fear and instability, deterring highly qualified professionals from seeking public service roles. This could significantly weaken the federal government’s institutional expertise over time.\n•Unintended Consequences: The rule may foster a toxic work environment by discouraging whistleblowing and incentivizing compliance over ethical or professional judgment, potentially diminishing overall efficiency and accountability.\n\nThe proposed rule poses substantial legal and policy challenges. It undermines statutory protections, raises constitutional concerns, and conflicts with the core principles of the civil service. Furthermore, it negatively affects workforce morale, public trust, and government efficiency.\n\nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to withdraw this proposed rule and instead explore alternative measures that address performance challenges without compromising legal protections or the integrity of the federal workforce.\n",

By carving approximately 50,000 positions out from longstanding civil service protections, this change opens the door to politicized firings rather than performance-based actions.  America’s merit system was established to ensure career federal employees can carry out the public’s business free from partisan pressure; stripping these employees of due-process safeguards undermines that core principle.\n\nCareer civil servants play a critical role in maintaining continuity, expertise, and trust across administrations.  When non-supervisory staff fear dismissal for expressing views or implementing policies they believe in, morale and retention will suffer—and the federal government will lose talented professionals to the private sector.  This rule, if finalized, will chill open discourse, encourage loyalty pledges over competence, and discourage qualified individuals from public service.\n\nRather than eroding the neutrality of the federal workforce, OPM should focus on enhancing existing performance-management tools—such as clear, consistent evaluation criteria and robust training for supervisors—while preserving essential appeal rights.  Punitive reclassification is a blunt instrument that fails to address genuine performance issues and instead invites politically motivated dismissals.\n\nFor these reasons, I oppose the proposed rule and request that OPM uphold the merit-based civil service system.

America’s merit system was established to ensure career federal employees can carry out the public’s business free from partisan pressure; stripping these employees of due-process safeguards undermines that core principle.\n\nCareer civil servants play a critical role in maintaining continuity, expertise, and trust across administrations.  When non-supervisory staff fear dismissal for expressing views or implementing policies they believe in, morale and retention will suffer—and the federal government will lose talented professionals to the private sector.  This rule, if finalized, will chill open discourse, encourage loyalty pledges over competence, and discourage qualified individuals from public service.\n\nRather than eroding the neutrality of the federal workforce, OPM should focus on enhancing existing performance-management tools—such as clear, consistent evaluation criteria and robust training for supervisors—while preserving essential appeal rights.  Punitive reclassification is a blunt instrument that fails to address genuine performance issues and instead invites politically motivated dismissals.\n\nFor these reasons, I oppose the proposed rule and request that OPM uphold the merit-based civil service system.  Thank you for your consideration.\n\nRespectfully,  \nChristopher Adams",

    "comment": "This legislation is not going to improve federal service or help the American people. By politicizing these jobs, you create an environment where the laws and regulations that appeal to each party can be emphasized and funded, while the ones that do not align with the administration in charge are defunded and disbanded. The American people are then eft with an abundance of confusion about what they can count on from each Agency. The American people deserve better than that! They deserve a consistent, well-serving Federal workforce made up of people from all walks of life and all political, economic, and racial groups. When the Federal workforce is aligned like the populace they serve, the service is fairer, and more consistent. And by not switching priorities every 2-4 years, the populace will know what to expect and how the Federal workforce will serve them at the present and into the future. This creates a secure America!\nFor example: if a person wanted to open a business that would distribute food products across the country. They would be subject to Federal FDA rules. If the current administration didn't want, or didn't fund a robust inspection program to enforce the rules, the business owner might open their business without the food protections that cost them considerable money. The food could be harmful and the American people could be at risk of getting sick. But even if that doesn't come to pass, if a differently aligned political party comes into power 2-4 years later, and a robust inspection program is funded, the new business owner could get inspected and found to be deficient. NOW they have to put in equipment or process that cost money, perhaps money they don't have. They were caught in an uncertain business climate and now they may have to take out loans to cover the cost or dip into the business's cash, or raise prices, or go out of business. This scenario can be thought through in the opposite direction, as well. Either way, it isn't fair to the business owner, the consumers, or the investors. \nAnother scenario: A young person who loves working in the outdoors considers a job at the National Park Service after high school. Due to a learning disability, they do not do well in a school setting and are sure that college is not for them. But they have a service-minded personality and would be thrilled to work in a National Park, cleaning up after disrespectful tourists, manning a booth taking admission fees, maintaining trails and assisting with conservation efforts. When this person graduates from high school, the political climate is favorable to become a NPS employee and they take a job with the NPS. After a number of years doing exceptional work, this person marries, buys a house, has children and enjoys the security of the job. But after a number of years, a new political administration comes in that doesn't believe that our National Parks are a treasure to protect and decides that the NPS workforce can be severely reduced and this person is fired (RIF'd). They have no college education and are now unemployed with a mortgage and family to support. Perhaps they could go to a state park to work and make considerably less pay, but they will probably have to take a job that doesn't align with their personality, skills, and experience. This is unfair to the worker. And it is unfair to the American people who want to enjoy our National Parks and need them to be maintained to do so! Having this priority at risk of changing on a whim, is not fair to the American people. Some may have chosen to live near, or spend their money to travel to these parks. They expect a consistent experience and deserve it if they are going to spend their hard-earned money on frequenting them.\nPeople say that this can happen at any job - any company can lay off any worker. But a company is different than a Federal Service. A company is a for-profit entity that needs to do what it has to - to stay in business. Federal Agencies are not for-profit companies. The American government is NOT a for-profit company. And it shouldn't be treated as such. Yes, the government should run as efficiently as possible, but service consistency MUST be maintained. Hiring and firing people at the will of each political party will destroy consistency. \nYes, the Federal deficit is huge! But trying to balance that by firing federal workers is not an efficient way to do that. The Federal Agencies ALL provide value and increase revenues over the long term. Inefficiencies and unproductive workers should be weeded out, and has been over each political party. But by making Federal workers at-will employees would hurt America over the long-term. \nI do not support changing Federal workers into at-will employees. I think it is a poorly thought out idea that will destroy our American services and hurt ALL Americans.",

It erodes trust in the civil service, discourages qualified applicants, and risks the public receiving biased, politically driven service instead of neutral, expert support.\n\n2. Amending 5 CFR part 212 (Competitive Service and Competitive Status):\nStatement:\nLetting employees keep their competitive status \"on paper\" while actually stripping them of competitive service protections undermines both employee rights and the principle of fair, merit-based government.\n\nWhy it should not be implemented:\nThis creates a false sense of security for employees while weakening the systems that protect them from unfair treatment. For the public, it means less stability and independence in the federal workforce, making it harder for agencies to consistently deliver services without political interference.\n\n3. Amending 5 CFR part 752 (Adverse Actions) and part 432 (Performance-Based Actions):\nStatement:\nRemoving due process rights — like appeal protections and performance review procedures — for employees shifted into Schedule Policy/Career roles opens the door to arbitrary firings based on politics, not merit.\n\nWhy it should not be implemented:\nWithout fair procedures, employees can be removed for political reasons, not job performance. This weakens the entire public service system, leading to instability, fear, and loss of experienced staff, which ultimately hurts the public who depend on expert, stable government services.\n\n4. Amending 5 CFR part 210 (Definitions Related to Political Appointments):\nStatement:\nChanging the definition so that career employees can now hold \"policy-influencing\" roles — once reserved for political appointees — invites political favoritism into what should be a professional, merit-based civil service.\n\nWhy it should not be implemented:\nThis undermines the tradition that career employees serve the country, not a political agenda. It risks critical decisions being shaped by political loyalty rather than expertise, harming the quality and impartiality of services that the public deserves.\n\n5.

    "comment": "I oppose this change to the April 2024 implementation of the rules to implement 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75.  Our democracy needs a professional civil service dedicated to implementing the law.  We need clear and rules to attract and protect people who choose to work in government, for the public good.  This replacement to the regulations issued in April would remove those protections and allow the President to fire a huge swath of the civil service and replace those people with political appointees.   This would not only politicize a workforce that should be nonpartisan - it would open the civil service to corruption. People could be hired as rewards for loyalty to the President rather than to the law, the Constitution, and the people.  We don't need more patronage - we need less.  The reckless cuts that DOGE has made has to the federal workforce has already started killing people who depended on USAID for food and vital drugs. These cuts have also destabilized the rule of law, harmed the reputation of the federal government as an employer, and harmed the American people (e,g, we cannot even inspect food plants anymore).  These changes to the rules would only enable more of that.   ",

    "comment": "Office of Personnel Management Proposed Rule \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" - Docket OPM-2025-0004\n\nI am commenting to express my strong and continued opposition to the proposed rule \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" as published in the Federal Register (90 FR 17182), Docket OPM-2025-0004.\n\nThe creation of a \"Schedule Policy/Career\" designation for policy-influencing positions, making them at-will and removing standard adverse action procedures and appeal processes, would fundamentally undermine the principles of a nonpartisan and merit-based civil service. This proposed change appears to inject political considerations into personnel decisions, creating an environment where career employees in critical roles could be removed for reasons other than poor performance or misconduct, specifically for perceived disloyalty to an administration's policy directives. This politicization would erode the professional independence of the civil service and lead to instability and a loss of valuable expertise within government agencies.\n\nThe lack of clear and objective criteria for defining \"policy-influencing\" positions raises concerns that this could be applied too broadly, impacting a significant number of dedicated civil servants who are not in the most senior policymaking roles. The loss of due process protections for these employees would be a significant step backward in ensuring fair treatment and job security within the federal workforce.\n\nSpecific aspects of the proposed rule undermine the ability of policy advisors and agency leaders to fulfill their essential duties:\n\nUndermining the Obligation to Highlight Legal Conflicts: This rule could undermine policy advisors' fundamental obligation to thoroughly analyze and highlight potential conflicts between proposed presidential directives and existing laws, regulations, and legal precedents. The fear of being seen as \"intentionally undermining\" a directive could discourage advisors from providing critical, objective legal assessments, potentially leading to ill-conceived or legally challenged policies.\n\nJeopardizing Careers for Respecting Legal Authority: The proposed rule jeopardizes the careers of dedicated policy makers who, in upholding their oath and the rule of law, respect congressional veto overrides or comply with court orders that directly oppose presidential directives. An employee should not face the threat of termination for adhering to the legal framework of our government. This rule creates a dangerous precedent where loyalty to a directive could be prioritized over the obligation to respect the balance of powers.\n\nCompromising Congressional oversight and the Independence of Agency Heads: This proposal compromises the intended role and independence of agency heads who are often approved by Congress and mandated to maintain a degree of autonomy to effectively carry out their agencies' missions. The fear of being deemed to be undermining a presidential directive could pressure these leaders to prioritize political alignment over their statutory obligations and professional judgment, ultimately hindering the effective functioning of government.\n\nMoreover, I want to emphasize that processes already exist within our system of governance to prevent federal employees from subverting the intention of laws and regulations. Mechanisms like the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provide checks to ensure agency actions align with legislative intent and established procedures. The proposed rule appears to disregard these existing robust frameworks designed to ensure accountability and prevent overreach.\n\nFinally, the definition of “policy making or policy influencing” positions in the proposed rule is excessively broad and dangerously open to abuse. Without clear and specific criteria, this designation could be applied arbitrarily to a wide range of career civil servants, including those whose roles have limited direct influence on high-level policy decisions. This lack of precision creates the potential for politically motivated reclassifications and subsequent removals, undermining the merit-based principles of the civil service.\n\nThis proposed rule, if implemented, would not only politicize the civil service but also create a chilling effect on objective policy analysis, undermine the rule of law within the executive branch, and compromise the necessary independence of agency leadership. It also disregards existing accountability mechanisms and relies on an overly broad and abusable definition.\n\nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to carefully consider these critical points and abandon this ill-conceived proposal. A robust and effective government relies on a civil service that is both accountable and empowered to provide objective advice and uphold the legal framework of our nation without fear of political reprisal.",

    "comment_text": "Office of Personnel Management Proposed Rule \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" - Docket OPM-2025-0004\n\nI am commenting to express my strong and continued opposition to the proposed rule \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" as published in the Federal Register (90 FR 17182), Docket OPM-2025-0004.\n\nThe creation of a \"Schedule Policy/Career\" designation for policy-influencing positions, making them at-will and removing standard adverse action procedures and appeal processes, would fundamentally undermine the principles of a nonpartisan and merit-based civil service. This proposed change appears to inject political considerations into personnel decisions, creating an environment where career employees in critical roles could be removed for reasons other than poor performance or misconduct, specifically for perceived disloyalty to an administration's policy directives. This politicization would erode the professional independence of the civil service and lead to instability and a loss of valuable expertise within government agencies.\n\nThe lack of clear and objective criteria for defining \"policy-influencing\" positions raises concerns that this could be applied too broadly, impacting a significant number of dedicated civil servants who are not in the most senior policymaking roles. The loss of due process protections for these employees would be a significant step backward in ensuring fair treatment and job security within the federal workforce.\n\nSpecific aspects of the proposed rule undermine the ability of policy advisors and agency leaders to fulfill their essential duties:\n\nUndermining the Obligation to Highlight Legal Conflicts: This rule could undermine policy advisors' fundamental obligation to thoroughly analyze and highlight potential conflicts between proposed presidential directives and existing laws, regulations, and legal precedents. The fear of being seen as \"intentionally undermining\" a directive could discourage advisors from providing critical, objective legal assessments, potentially leading to ill-conceived or legally challenged policies.\n\nJeopardizing Careers for Respecting Legal Authority: The proposed rule jeopardizes the careers of dedicated policy makers who, in upholding their oath and the rule of law, respect congressional veto overrides or comply with court orders that directly oppose presidential directives. An employee should not face the threat of termination for adhering to the legal framework of our government. This rule creates a dangerous precedent where loyalty to a directive could be prioritized over the obligation to respect the balance of powers.\n\nCompromising Congressional oversight and the Independence of Agency Heads: This proposal compromises the intended role and independence of agency heads who are often approved by Congress and mandated to maintain a degree of autonomy to effectively carry out their agencies' missions. The fear of being deemed to be undermining a presidential directive could pressure these leaders to prioritize political alignment over their statutory obligations and professional judgment, ultimately hindering the effective functioning of government.\n\nMoreover, I want to emphasize that processes already exist within our system of governance to prevent federal employees from subverting the intention of laws and regulations. Mechanisms like the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provide checks to ensure agency actions align with legislative intent and established procedures. The proposed rule appears to disregard these existing robust frameworks designed to ensure accountability and prevent overreach.\n\nFinally, the definition of “policy making or policy influencing” positions in the proposed rule is excessively broad and dangerously open to abuse. Without clear and specific criteria, this designation could be applied arbitrarily to a wide range of career civil servants, including those whose roles have limited direct influence on high-level policy decisions. This lack of precision creates the potential for politically motivated reclassifications and subsequent removals, undermining the merit-based principles of the civil service.\n\nThis proposed rule, if implemented, would not only politicize the civil service but also create a chilling effect on objective policy analysis, undermine the rule of law within the executive branch, and compromise the necessary independence of agency leadership. It also disregards existing accountability mechanisms and relies on an overly broad and abusable definition.\n\nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to carefully consider these critical points and abandon this ill-conceived proposal. A robust and effective government relies on a civil service that is both accountable and empowered to provide objective advice and uphold the legal framework of our nation without fear of political reprisal.",

With such an expedited turnaround from E.O. to proposal, and no substantive discussion on the economic impacts of this rule, which would seem to be significant in terms of potential mass-firings over time, it appears not.\nSecondly, it’s laughable hypocritical that an administration unabashedly dedicated to tit-for-tat patronage in political and staff level appointments (e.g., the DOGE employees selected by Elon Musk, and unelected special employee, now embedded across departments) would pretend to be so concerned with such activities occurring at the lowest levels of government. And the evidence that there are parties attempting to “resist” from within is weak at best, and frankly displays zero understanding of the actual workings of federal agencies, and their dedicated career staff. \nThird, the reliance on a walk through history beginning in the 1800s (when black people were enslaved, women had no rights, and workers would routinely die on the job needlessly due to lack of basic safety requirements) is sad. If you think the 1800s, early 1900s, etc. are the benchmark society that we American citizens want to live in now, please disabuse yourselves of that notion. The forward movement in the laws of the 1960s and 1970s, a time when equality and fairness was finally being paid attention to on a national political level are why those laws should stand, and the protections under those laws via the regulations for civil service protections are good.\nFinally, I do believe that it is difficult to ultimately fire certain employees in the civil service, but I do not believe the issue is with the protections they are offered. Rather, I believe that there is a lack of accountability from the top down to address poor performers according to the rules and processes available. A reform at the agency level to ensure existing responsible managers are following the rules that exist would be a more effective and circumspect approach to poor performers.\nIt is also not clear at what level the ability to fire newly at-will employees would reside. Only managers with direct knowledge of an employees duties and performance should have that ability. This rule does not make that clear.\nGo back to the drawing board and study current law, GAO reports, and IG reports to understand how to address the issue of accountability you claim is the goal of this rule.

    "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule titled \"Reforming the Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Service\" (OPM-2025-0004-0001). While I support efforts to enhance efficiency and uphold constitutional values within the federal workforce, I am deeply concerned that the proposed changes could undermine the foundational principles of a nonpartisan civil service.\n\nThe emphasis on hiring individuals who are \"committed to upholding the rule of law and the United States Constitution\" and preventing the hiring of those \"unwilling to defend the Constitution or to faithfully serve the Executive Branch\" raises significant concerns. Such language is vague and could be interpreted to favor individuals who align ideologically with the current administration, thereby facilitating the removal or exclusion of civil service employees based on political beliefs.\n\nThis approach appears to contravene the Merit System Principles outlined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301, which emphasize that federal personnel management should be implemented without regard to political affiliation and should protect employees from arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes. Additionally, 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(1) prohibits discrimination for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of political affiliation.\n\nFurthermore, the proposed rule's potential to reclassify positions and alter hiring practices without clear safeguards could erode the protections afforded to career civil servants, leading to a workforce that is more susceptible to political influence and less focused on impartial service to the public.\n\nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to reconsider the proposed rule and ensure that any reforms to the federal hiring process uphold the principles of merit-based employment and protect the nonpartisan nature of the civil service.",

    "comment": "This change to Federal civil service would replace a transparent system that has merit-based hiring and clear review process for employee performance with a simple system where any underperforming employee is given a sing opportunity to improve or be fired.  The new system proposed creates an opaque system to determine 'policy influencing positions' and provide unilateral ability to fire those employees not based on performance, but perceived loyalty to elected officials.  This replaces objective career professionals who are loyal to the U.S. Constitution, rather than elected officials that rotate in and out of power.  This would be detrimental the professionalism and objectivity of career expert civil servants to who defend the Constitution and implement laws passed by Congress with the funding allocated by Congress for the benefit of U.S. taxpayers.  This change is a thinly-veiled attempt to remove objective, professional experts, from being career civil servants and replace them with ideologues loyal to elected officials. The current merit system provides high-quality services.  The existing standards, review requirements, and transparent process for removing poor performers is functioning as intended to ensure that objective, expert, career civil servants are consistently providing quality services.  Creating this new schedule that allows politicians to remove staff they perceive has having different opinions is not in the best interest of the United States.  We should not take the risk of injustice from passion and prejudice, which no law or regulation can control, when there is already a transparent and effective system to remove civil servants that are not effective.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \"Schedule F\" classification (irrespective of its current name) for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence. While 5 U.S.C. § 3301 grants the President authority to prescribe regulations for the competitive service, it DOES NOT permit blanket reclassification permission, nor removal of due process rights. \n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations. Additionally, the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule's broad reclassification of policy-related roles likely exceeds OPM's regulatory authority under 5 U.S.C. § 3302, which requires that exceptions to competitive service rules be \"necessary\" and \"conditions of good administration.\" Courts will likely strike it down as arbitrary and capricious under Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm (1983).\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. It disregards Title 5 protections, congressional intent, and judicial precedent safeguarding merit-based civil service. If implemented, it invites litigation under the CSRA, APA, and Constitutional doctrines, with a high likelihood of being struck down. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

Indeed,\nOPM has telegraphed that a reversal isn’t happening, asserting that it “must comport with”\nExecutive Order 13957 and that “[d]eclining to help the President execute this directive would be\na dereliction of OPM’s statutory duty.”2 Fair enough; it would be unrealistic to expect OPM to\nsecond-guess an executive order issued by the current President. Accordingly, feds like me will\npin our hopes on the judicial branch, which will independently assess whether the Trump\nadministration’s novel reinterpretation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 is the “best\nreading” of that statute under Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2266\n(2024).3\nWhile the outcome of this rulemaking may be preordained, I have written this comment for one\nimportant purpose. Taking advantage of the candor afforded by anonymity, I hope to refute the\ndisparaging suspicion of federal employees at the heart of Executive Order 14171—not only to\nunderscore that this initiative is unnecessary, but to convey to Trump administration officials that\n1 Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, The DOGE Plan to Reform Government, Wall Street Journal (Nov.\n20, 2024), https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-\nsupreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-\nramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-\nfa51c020.\n2 90 FR 17200, 17218.\n3 As a regulatory analyst, it would be supremely ironic if the Loper Bright decision ends up saving my\njob.\n1\nthey can trust in the capability and professionalism of career policy staff. Whether you believe it\nor not, we are here to help you.\nHowever, trust is a two-way street, and OPM has done much to diminish its credibility in the\ninitial months of this administration.4 To the extent OPM is sincere in promising that “employees\nwho faithfully perform their jobs to the best of their ability have little to fear from Schedule\nPolicy/Career,”5 I urge OPM to implement meaningful safeguards beyond those included in its\nNPRM—in particular, language that would prohibit the arbitrary firing or mass firing of\nSchedule Policy/Career employees. Such safeguards would demonstrate OPM’s sincerity about\nthe stated intent of amended Executive Order 13957—i.e., holding bad actors accountable—\nwhile mitigating some of its harms.\nA Solution in Search of a Problem\nBefore getting into the details of the NPRM, I wish to share my perspective as a federal\nemployee who will likely be reclassified into Schedule Policy/Career, retaining my anonymity\nfor obvious reasons. For context, I previously commented in support of OPM’s 2024 rule and\nwas quoted at length in the preamble of that rule.6\nAs I described in my earlier comment, I am a GS-13 regulatory analyst who works in the “Office\nof Policy” of a prominent federal agency. For better or worse, my agency engages in some of the\nmost contentious policy work in the federal government. For example, my agency’s policy\npriorities change dramatically depending on the political party in charge of the Presidency. Our\nrulemakings typically attract thousands of comments and have been the subject of Congressional\ncommittee hearings. Adverse stakeholders challenge our rules and sub-regulatory guidance in\ncourt, with disputes occasionally reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. My “substantive\nparticipation” in this contested policy work is important and exciting,7 but given its sensitivity, I\nam scrupulous to maintain the effort, professionalism, and objectivity expected of a taxpayer-\nfunded federal employee.\nAs a career analyst, I have worked closely and successfully with political appointees under the\nObama, Trump, and Biden administrations to issue regulations and policy guidance consistent\nwith the policy priorities of those administrations. Naturally, I have personal opinions about the\npolicy work I do, and I sometimes disagree with my politically appointed leaders about specific\n4 See, e.g., Eric Katz, As Re-Firings Begin, Judge Demands Trump Administration Tell Probationary\nEmployees They Were Not Let Go for Poor Performance, Politico (April 21, 2025), https://\nwww.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/opm-firing-probationary-federal-agency-employees-judge-\nruling-00206615; Billy Mitchell, OPM Quietly Swapped Out Privacy Assessment for Governmentwide\nEmail System Central to Ongoing Litigation, FedScoop (March 3, 2025), https://fedscoop.com/opm-\nemail-privacy-assessment-swap-ongoing-litigation/.\n5 90 FR 17218.\n6 See 89 FR 25001 (Comment 3195).\n7 E.O. 13957, sec. 5(c)(i).\n2\npolicies or projects. In fact, robust civil service protections have empowered me—and,\ncollectively, my coworkers and other career employees—to occasionally share policy\nrecommendations or serious concerns with agency leadership, which sometimes results in our\nleadership changing course. This is a perfectly normal and healthy process, as career civil\nservants are supposed to provide candid deliberative advice to the politically appointed leaders\nwho ultimately make the decisions. As OPM continues to recognize,8 candid internal feedback\nfrom career policy staff helps to ensure that regulatory changes and other policy initiatives are\nmaximally effective, sustainable, and legally defensible.\nAt the same time, I and other career federal employees certainly understand that we are not the\ndecisionmakers. Elections in a democracy have consequences, and it is entirely appropriate for\nagencies to pursue the policy preferences of the elected President who appoints its leaders. This\nis widely understood by all federal employees, who typically go above and beyond Hatch Act\nrequirements to refrain from appearing politically biased whether we’re on or off the clock.\nSpeaking personally, I have often worked to delay, withdraw, rescind, and/or replace rules that I\nhelped a previous administration to promulgate. Occasionally, I have drafted preamble language\nrebutting the very same language that I personally authored years before in an earlier\nrulemaking. I have also proactively “pitched” policy ideas to agency leadership in every\nPresidential administration, including in this administration. In fact, I and my coworkers have\nalready brainstormed numerous ideas for regulatory relief consistent with the deregulatory aims\nof Executive Orders 14192 and 14219.9\nGiven this experience, I am incredulous at OPM’s assertion that policy resistance is “a\nwidespread phenomenon.”10 This assertion is a reversal from OPM’s findings last year,11 and it\nflies in the face of my personal experience. Sensationalist claims about a widespread “deep state”\nor “resistance” within the federal civil service simply do not reflect reality. For example, if there\ntruly was widespread “policy resistance” against the Trump administration among the 50,000\nemployees who might be reclassified into Schedule Policy/Career, one would expect ubiquitous\nleaks about agency rulemakings and other sensitive policy initiatives to news outlets and adverse\nstakeholders. Here, OPM cites to just one example of a career employee ever leaking a policy\ndocument—a draft Presidential executive order promoting classical and traditional architectural\nstyles in the design of federal buildings.12 This one example, involving a seemingly trivial policy\nissue, does not establish that policy resistance is a “widespread” phenomenon.13\n8 See 90 FR 17208 (“Career staff critiques, especially those coming from a political perspective that\ndiffers from political appointees, ultimately strengthens policymaking and produces better agency\ndecisions.”).\n9 See 90 FR 9065 (Executive Order 14192); 90 FR 10583 (Executive Order 14219).\n10 90 FR 17194.\n11 89 FR 25000 (“OPM does not agree that employing civil servants … thwarts the agenda of any\nPresident, and [such assertions] lack any well-founded support.”).\n12 90 FR 17193 n. 151.\n13 To be clear, I do not condone the actions of that apparently disgruntled architect.\n3\nThe truth is that, like me, the overwhelming majority of career staff respect the integrity of the\npolicymaking process and the importance of deferring to our Presidentially-appointed leaders.\nOPM’s citation to unscientific poll results and a handful of clickbait articles do not make a\npersuasive case to the contrary.\nIn sum, Schedule Policy/Career appears to be a solution in search of a problem. I am not opposed\nto holding bad actors accountable, but I have never witnessed or heard about insubordination or\n“policy resistance” at my agency of the kind imagined in the NPRM. So, as a threshold matter, I\ndisagree that there is a problem serious enough to justify stripping civil service protections from\nme and 50,000 other federal employees.\nWeak Protections and Hollow Assurances\nSection 6 of amended Executive Order 13957 provides that “[e]mployees in or applicants for\nSchedule Policy/Career positions are not required to personally or politically support the current\nPresident or the policies of the current administration,” and separately instructs agencies to\n“establish rules to prohibit the same personnel practices prohibited by [5 U.S.C. 2302(b)] with\nrespect to any employee or applicant for employment in Schedule Policy/Career of the excepted\nservice.”14 Additionally, amended Executive Order 13957 deviates from the original Executive\nOrder 13957 by designating the new schedule as “Schedule Policy/Career” rather than “Schedule\nF”—ostensibly to rebut “misinformation” that the administration will use the new schedule as “a\nmeans of converting career positions to political positions.”15\nThese protections are better than nothing, but they seem functionally unenforceable. As OPM\nnoted last year:\nOnce hirings and firings are at-will … [an] employee might not have an\nentitlement to written notice of the reasons for [an] adverse action, an opportunity\nto respond, or a written decision. Nor would the decision generally be appealable.\nIt would thus be, at a minimum, difficult for employees to protect themselves\nfrom actions based on political beliefs or party allegiance because no cause (or\nevidence) would be required prior to such an action. Under Schedule F, because\nsuch an employee would be at-will, the employer would need to give little or no\nreason prior to a termination. In short, Schedule F leaves innumerable ways for\npolitics to factor into these traditionally merit-based decisions in a manner that\nwould be difficult to detect or remedy.16\nEven in its new NPRM, OPM acknowledges the risk that “some [agency] officials” may “treat\nSchedule Policy/Career positions as noncareer positions” and fire employees for perceived\n14 E.O. 13957, sec. 6.\n15 90 FR 17200.\n16 89 FR 24994 (citations omitted).\n4\npolitical disloyalty.17 In response, OPM replies that it will “be heavily involved in the\nimplementation of Schedule Policy/Career” and “if necessary … can recommend additional\nmeasures to prevent abuses.”18 Respectfully, these vague assurances are not good enough. OPM\nis the federal agency with the duty to implement amended Executive Order 13957 and should not\nwait for predictable harms to materialize before merely “recommend[ing]” solutions. Indeed,\nsection 6(a) of amended Executive Order 13957 instructs that “agencies”—including OPM—\n“shall establish rules to prohibit [certain] personnel practices” against Schedule Policy/Career\nemployees,19 but OPM’s NPRM fails to include any language about prohibited personnel\npractices in the proposed reg text for 5 CFR 213.3501.20 At minimum, OPM should fix that\noversight in its final rule.\nOf course, the bigger problem is that nothing in OPM’s NPRM or in the express text of amended\nExecutive Order 13957 will protect Schedule Policy/Career employees from mass firings. As\nOPM notes, “placing … employees into Schedule Policy/Career makes them functionally at-\nwill.”21 Thus, as long as agencies do not discriminate when they fire individual employees,\nagency heads will be newly empowered to quickly fire large groups of federal employees for no\nreason at all—as many as 50,000 across the federal government, according to OPM's estimate in\nthe NPRM.22 Contemplating the protections afforded to Schedule Policy/Career employees, one\nis reminded of Joseph Stalin’s infamous distinction between tragedies and statistics.\nIn a tacit acknowledgement of concerns that Schedule Policy/Career could be used for mass\nfirings, OPM assures that “employees who faithfully perform their jobs to the best of their ability\nhave little to fear from Schedule Policy/Career … [as] agencies have strong incentives not to\ndismiss employees who are competently performing their assigned duties.”23 Of particular\nrelevance to me, OPM aptly notes that “drafting regulations and guidance … are complex tasks\nthat require considerable experience with the subject matter and technical procedures” which\n“[f]ew newly hired employees—career or noncareer—can do … effectively,” concluding that “a\nPresident who wants agencies to implement his policies has strong incentives not to dismiss\nexperienced regulation writers who are performing timely and quality work, no matter their\npersonal political affiliation.”24 Relatedly, OPM asserts that “the President and his appointees\nhave additional incentivizes to maintain a career workforce that contains a diversity of views and\nopinions … [as] frank and fearless advice to agency leadership … helps agencies make better\ndecisions, which the President and agency leaders value.”25\n17 90 FR 17209.\n18 Id.\n19 E.O. 13957, sec. 6(a) (emphasis added).\n20 See 90 FR 17222.\n21 90 FR 17218.\n22 90 FR 17220.\n23 90 FR 17218.\n24 90 FR 17208.\n25 90 FR 17208-09.\n5\nI wholeheartedly agree with OPM’s statements quoted in the paragraph above, but they ring\nhollow in light of other actions and statements from the Trump administration exhibiting extreme\nhostility towards federal employees,26 including from President Trump. For example, in\ndescribing his regulatory freeze order issued on January 20, 2025, President Trump deviated\nfrom prepared remarks to quip that “Most of those bureaucrats are being fired, they’re gone.\nShould be all of them, but some sneak through, but we have to live with a couple I guess.”27\nIn this context, in the absence of specific safeguards to prevent us from being fired for arbitrary\nreasons, OPM’s assurances to career staff in the NPRM feels like gaslighting from the villain in a\npredictable horror film. “I’m so happy to have you for dinner! Would you mind stepping down\ninto that soundproof basement?”\nConclusion\nWhile civil service protections are important for all federal employees, they are particularly\nimportant for career policy staff, who perform important work for considerably less pay than\nwhat they could earn in the private sector.28 Candor is key to our jobs, and civil service\nprotections are key to our candor. Unfortunately, amended Executive Order 13957 and new\nSchedule Policy/Career will strip civil service protections from thousands of federal employees\nwho are already weary and demoralized—an extremely misguided policy move. Among other\nharms, the new Schedule Policy/Career will:\n• jeopardize the careers and livelihoods of thousands of federal employees;\n• deter career staff from providing candid deliberative advice for fear of perceived\n“resistance;” and\n• damage government efforts to recruit, hire, and retain talent, thereby reducing the speed\nand effectiveness of the federal government.\n26 See Executive Order 14210 of February 11, 2025, 90 FR 9669 (instructing agencies to “promptly\nundertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force”); see also, e.g., Molly Redden and Andy\nKroll, “Put Them in Trauma”: Inside a Key MAGA Leader’s Plans for a New Trump Agenda, ProPublica\n(Oct. 24, 2024), https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-\namerica-maga; Taylor Giorno, ‘We Are Terrified’: Musk Puts USAID Through ‘Wood Chipper,’ The Hill\n(Feb. 3, 2025), https://www.thehill.com/policy/technology/5122676-usaid-shutdown-elon-musk-doge/.\n27 See https://www.youtube.com/live/SzozeHjyLv4?t=656s; see also Erich Wagner, Trump: Agencies\nShould Fire 'All' Bureaucrats, Government Executive (Jan. 20, 2025), https://www.govexec.com/\nworkforce/2025/01/trump-agencies-should-fire-all-bureaucrats/402353/.\n28 For example, according to the Congressional Budget Office, “Federal workers with a professional\ndegree or doctorate—about 10 percent of the federal workforce—earn about 29 percent less, on average,\nthan their private-sector counterparts.” Congressional Budget Office, “Comparing the Compensation of\nFederal and Private-Sector Employees in 2022,” (April 2024) at 1, https://www.cbo.gov/publication/\n60235.\n6\nAdditional safeguards—such as a language prohibiting the arbitrary firing or mass firing of\nSchedule Policy/Career employees—could mitigate some of these harms, but this\nadministration’s damage to the federal workforce has already been immense. I don’t fault other\nfederal employees who have decided to move on, but I plan to stick around as long as I can, as I\ncontinue to believe in the mission of my agency and in the importance of my job to that mission.\nGoing forward, I hope to work in partnership with my agency’s new leadership, who I do not\nhold at fault for the actions of others in this administration. I had positive personal relationships\nwith political appointees from the first Trump administration, and I hope that a successful\ncollaboration this time around can serve as a positive example for the rest of the federal\ngovernment. At the same time, consistent with OPM’s recommendation, I will continue to\nprovide “frank and fearless advice to agency leadership” when I see critical mistakes.29 This\ncomment is submitted in that spirit.\nThank you for your consideration.\n29 90 FR 17209.\n7",

Although these positions are described as remaining career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis, the at-will nature inherently introduces a vulnerability to political influence. This is particularly concerning for scientific agencies like the NIH, where policy decisions must be grounded in rigorous, unbiased research rather than shifting political agendas.\n\nThe ability to remove employees without the usual procedural safeguards could deter scientists from pursuing innovative or controversial research topics, fearing repercussions tied to political sensitivities rather than scientific merit. Such an environment risks stifling scientific progress and undermines the credibility of institutions that rely on objective analysis to inform public health policies.\n\nTo preserve the integrity of scientific research and maintain public confidence in our institutions, I urge a reconsideration of the provisions that allow for at-will employment in policy-influencing positions. Implementing robust protections against political interference is crucial to ensure that science remains a guiding force for the public good, free from partisan pressures.",

    "comment": "I’m firmly against bringing back or creating anything like “Schedule F” for federal employees. This kind of policy would deal a serious blow to the merit-based civil service system that has kept our federal workforce professional and nonpartisan for well over 100 years.\n\nLet’s be clear—this idea goes completely against the spirit of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. That law was passed to stop the old “spoils system,” where jobs were handed out as political favors, and instead establish a system based on merit. Schedule F would do the opposite—it would allow large numbers of career civil servants, especially those involved in policy, to be reclassified and fired without cause. That opens the door wide to political interference and hiring based on loyalty rather than qualifications or expertise.\n\nIt also violates the due process rights federal workers currently have. Under current law (5 U.S.C. § 7513), career employees are supposed to be protected from unjust termination—they deserve fair procedures and a valid reason before being removed. Schedule F throws those protections out the window, weakening both job security and the ability of employees to offer honest, expert advice—even when it’s not politically convenient.\n\nThere’s also the issue of OPM’s responsibility. The Office of Personnel Management is legally required (5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.) to uphold the merit system principles. Schedule F would force OPM to work against its own mission by placing political pressure on career staff, disrupting the stability and impartiality of federal programs that are meant to last across administrations.\n\nBottom line: Schedule F is a dangerous idea. It threatens good governance, undermines the independence of the civil service, and chips away at the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to stand firm against any attempt to revive or implement it.",

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles.

    "comment": "To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI strongly oppose the proposed rule that would establish a new Schedule Policy/Career employment category. This rule raises serious legal concerns, including direct conflict with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and well-established constitutional due process protections for federal employees.\n\n1. Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 2301–2302)\nThe CSRA enshrines the merit system principles as the cornerstone of federal employment. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(2) states that \"all employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management… with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights.\"\n\nFurthermore, 5 U.S.C. § 7513 mandates that adverse actions, including removals and suspensions, be carried out only \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\" and requires advance notice, representation, and an opportunity to respond. The proposed Schedule Policy/Career classification unlawfully circumvents these statutory protections by permitting at-will removal without these required procedures.\n\n2. Undermining Constitutional Due Process Rights\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), that public employees with a property interest in their continued employment are entitled to due process before termination. By designating career civil servants as at-will employees and removing their appeal rights, the rule violates this constitutional guarantee.\n\nEven policy-influencing roles do not lose their entitlement to basic procedural protections when filled through competitive, nonpolitical appointments. Attempting to redefine these roles to strip away due process is a de facto repeal of civil service rights without Congressional authorization.\n\n3. Exceeds OPM’s Statutory Authority\nThe proposed rule attempts to unilaterally reclassify large swaths of the workforce and redefine fundamental aspects of federal employment. This oversteps the regulatory authority granted to the Office of Personnel Management under 5 U.S.C. § 1103, which does not permit wholesale reclassification of employees to evade the merit-based protections mandated by Congress.\n\nCourts have been skeptical of agencies attempting to bypass clear statutory protections through rulemaking. As noted in Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014), \"an agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.\"\n\n4. Risk of Politicization and Retaliation\nThe proposed rule’s stated justification includes removing employees who “undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.” This vague and subjective standard, when combined with at-will status, invites abuse and may be used to purge qualified employees for ideological reasons, not performance—a direct violation of 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(10), which prohibits discrimination based on political affiliation.\n\nConclusion:\nThe proposed rule is not only bad policy but also likely unlawful. It threatens to erode the apolitical nature of the civil service, bypasses core legal protections enshrined in the CSRA and the Constitution, and grants the Executive Branch undue power over career personnel.\n\nI urge OPM to withdraw this proposal in its entirety.",

Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 2301–2302)\nThe CSRA enshrines the merit system principles as the cornerstone of federal employment. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(2) states that \"all employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management… with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights.\"\n\nFurthermore, 5 U.S.C. § 7513 mandates that adverse actions, including removals and suspensions, be carried out only \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\" and requires advance notice, representation, and an opportunity to respond. The proposed Schedule Policy/Career classification unlawfully circumvents these statutory protections by permitting at-will removal without these required procedures.\n\n2. Undermining Constitutional Due Process Rights\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), that public employees with a property interest in their continued employment are entitled to due process before termination. By designating career civil servants as at-will employees and removing their appeal rights, the rule violates this constitutional guarantee.\n\nEven policy-influencing roles do not lose their entitlement to basic procedural protections when filled through competitive, nonpolitical appointments. Attempting to redefine these roles to strip away due process is a de facto repeal of civil service rights without Congressional authorization.\n\n3. Exceeds OPM’s Statutory Authority\nThe proposed rule attempts to unilaterally reclassify large swaths of the workforce and redefine fundamental aspects of federal employment. This oversteps the regulatory authority granted to the Office of Personnel Management under 5 U.S.C. § 1103, which does not permit wholesale reclassification of employees to evade the merit-based protections mandated by Congress.\n\nCourts have been skeptical of agencies attempting to bypass clear statutory protections through rulemaking. As noted in Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014), \"an agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.\"\n\n4. Risk of Politicization and Retaliation\nThe proposed rule’s stated justification includes removing employees who “undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.” This vague and subjective standard, when combined with at-will status, invites abuse and may be used to purge qualified employees for ideological reasons, not performance—a direct violation of 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(10), which prohibits discrimination based on political affiliation.\n\nConclusion:\nThe proposed rule is not only bad policy but also likely unlawful. It threatens to erode the apolitical nature of the civil service, bypasses core legal protections enshrined in the CSRA and the Constitution, and grants the Executive Branch undue power over career personnel.\n\nI urge OPM to withdraw this proposal in its entirety.",

Federal employees possess a property interest in their continued employment, and reclassifying positions to at-will status without individualized due process may violate the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. As highlighted in Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41 (2012), federal employees are entitled to meaningful procedural protections and access to redress. Schedule F undermines those principles.\n\nThird, this rule would weaken merit system principles enshrined in federal law, including the requirement that hiring and firing decisions be made based on competence and performance, not political loyalty. The nonpartisan, apolitical character of the civil service is a cornerstone of American democracy and public trust.\n\nReinstating Schedule F would politicize career appointments, damage morale, erode institutional expertise, and violate long-standing legal frameworks designed to ensure government accountability and professionalism.\n\nI urge OPM to withdraw this proposal in its entirety",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal will not improve performance, accountability or responsiveness. The proposed action threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nThe creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nThe vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.\"",

    "comment": "The Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) proposed rule, OPM-2025-0004-0001, amending 5 CFR Part 731, delegates authority to the OPM Director to make suitability determinations and issue removal directives for federal employees based on post-appointment conduct. This aligns with the reintroduction of Schedule F, rebranded as Schedule Policy/Career in 2025, aiming to reclassify career employees as at-will, stripping them of merit-based protections. As a union-minded scholar, I oppose this rule for its assault on meritocracy, due process, and labor rights, threatening the integrity of the federal civil service.\nThe federal civil service, rooted in the Pendleton Act of 1883, ensures competence and impartiality, shielding employees from political pressures. The proposed rule undermines this by centralizing authority in the OPM Director, mandating agency compliance within five workdays, and aligning with Schedule F’s agenda to politicize the workforce. Schedule F, introduced in 2020 and revoked in 2021, sought to reclassify employees in policy roles as at-will, enabling dismissals without cause. Its 2025 revival, as noted on X, risks replacing career professionals with loyalists, prioritizing politics over expertise.\nThe rule’s vague criteria for “unsuitable” conduct invite abuse, allowing subjective or politicized removals. This contradicts merit-based principles, where decisions should reflect performance, not loyalty. Centralizing authority bypasses agencies’ contextual knowledge, eroding the decentralized structure that ensures fairness. Historically, suitability determinations balanced agency needs with employee rights; this rule tilts toward arbitrary discipline, undermining trust in governance.\nDue process, a cornerstone of labor law, is gutted by the rule’s five-day compliance mandate, limiting employees’ ability to challenge decisions via the Merit Systems Protection Board or unions. This disproportionately harms unionized workers, whose collective bargaining agreements protect against unjust actions. The rule’s silence on union involvement signals a deliberate sidelining of labor, chilling federal workers’ ability to engage in union activities or exercise First Amendment rights. Such ambiguity risks targeting employees for non-job-related conduct, fostering fear and compliance over independence.\nThe rule operationalizes Schedule F by enabling rapid dismissals of employees deemed misaligned with political priorities. X posts highlight Schedule F as a “dangerous” politicization of public service, undermining agencies’ impartiality. This institutional capture prioritizes partisan agendas, demoralizing workers and reducing expertise in critical areas like public health or environmental protection. The sociological impact—eroding trust in institutions—threatens democratic governance, as politicized agencies may neglect equitable policymaking.\nEconomically, the rule destabilizes federal workers, many supporting families and communities. At-will employment creates uncertainty, disproportionately affecting marginalized groups vulnerable to discriminatory “suitability” interpretations. Socially, a loyalist-driven civil service may prioritize political goals over public needs, exacerbating inequalities in healthcare, poverty, or environmental justice. This betrays the civil service’s oath to the Constitution, not any administration.\nThe rule’s alignment with Schedule F demands its withdrawal. It threatens the meritocratic foundation of the civil service, erodes labor protections, and risks long-term harm to governance. If OPM proceeds, it must: 1) reaffirm merit-based criteria; 2) ensure robust due process with extended timelines and appeals; 3) consult unions to preserve bargaining rights; 4) reject Schedule F’s politicization; and 5) enhance transparency through public hearings.\nFederal employees deserve a system that upholds fairness, not one that sacrifices them to political expediency.

    "comment": "I oppose the proposed regulation OPM-2025-0004, which seeks to reclassify certain federal positions into the new “Schedule Policy/Career” category. This change would strip civil service protections from approximately 50,000 federal employees, making them at-will and vulnerable to dismissal without the standard due process. Such a move threatens the merit-based foundation of the federal workforce, opening the door to politicization and undermining the nonpartisan execution of government functions.\n\nBy removing established safeguards, the regulation risks creating an environment where career professionals can be terminated for political reasons, rather than for legitimate performance issues. This not only jeopardizes the impartiality of federal agencies but also deters qualified individuals from public service due to job insecurity. The proposed rule’s potential to erode institutional knowledge and expertise could lead to inefficiencies and a decline in the quality of public services.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of clear criteria for reclassification raises concerns about arbitrary or discriminatory implementation. The regulation’s broad scope and the significant number of positions affected necessitate thorough scrutiny and debate. I urge reconsideration of this proposal and the upholding of the principles of a fair, competent, and apolitical civil service.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

If these individuals can be replaced with each change in administration, there will be severe effects. First, there will be no institutional expertise that ensures timely, constructive evaluation of grants.  Grants will be awarded based on the interests of a given administration at that time, rather than the scientific and health needs of the country. Additionally, if the personnel at the NIH change repeatedly, complex multi-institutional research projects will be nearly impossible as the new NIH employees will be unable to identify appropriate centers to participate.

    "comment": "I’m strongly against bringing back or creating anything like the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. It’s a serious threat to the merit-based civil service system that’s helped keep our government professional and nonpartisan for over 100 years.\n\nLet’s be real—Schedule F basically goes against everything the Pendleton Act of 1883 was designed to fix. That law was put in place to stop the old “spoils system” and make sure federal jobs are awarded based on qualifications, not political connections. But Schedule F would let a huge number of career civil servants—especially folks involved in policy work—get reclassified and possibly fired without any real cause. That opens the door to political loyalty tests, which totally goes against the whole idea of a neutral, professional civil service. Federal law (5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8)) clearly says hiring and firing should be based on merit, not politics.\n\nIt also raises big red flags when it comes to due process. The rules in 5 U.S.C. § 7513 are there to make sure career employees can’t just be fired on a whim—they’re supposed to have protections and a fair process. Taking that away from thousands of federal workers doesn’t just hurt morale, it could seriously chill open debate and expert input inside agencies. That’s bad news for effective government.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is supposed to uphold those merit system values (per 5 U.S.C. § 1101 and beyond), and Schedule F would force them to go in the exact opposite direction. It puts unfair political pressure on career employees and threatens the stability of programs that need to work across different administrations.\n\nBottom line: Schedule F is a major step backwards. It undermines good governance, weakens the independence of civil servants, and chips away at the rule of law.

Our foundation of federal government service is predicated on good, hard working, honest people that volunteer to provide our Nation the services needed to effectively care for our fellow Americans. These are underpaid, underappreciated, American federal workers that perform under a variety of stressors, none of which require changing their status to Policy/Career, and the only reason this is being considered is to allow for their immediate termination. Removing the prerequisite protections that federal workers have in regard to not being \"fired at will\", and \"unable to speak truth to authority\" for \"fear of losing their job\", will create a spoils system that will reward unethical, illegal, and immoral behavior and subsequently fail to provide the very services our fellow Americans paid their taxes to receive. In addition to this damaging the American people, allowing this action will directly endanger both serving bureaucrats and politicians by creating this spoils system that will provide multiple opportunities to engage in purposeful sabotage that will result in disastrous (read: fatal) outcomes. All levels of leadership (including appointees) will now have to be aware that \"the one mistake that can be blamed on them will result in their termination\". Coupled with the possibility that in this new environment, there is no foreseeable penalty for an at-will employee if \"one was to sabotage that supervisor to get them fired, making an opening for their own advancement\" due to the spoils system. If the only motivation an employee has is to not get fired, then they will do or make the appearance that they are doing their job at bare minimum, which means that the quality of the work will suffer, leaving them vulnerable to inducements to not do their job. Multiple this mindset by hundreds of thousands of federal workers, with their only concern is not getting fired will ultimately affect every aspect of American life.

    "comment": "I unequivocally oppose the implementation—or any effort toward the reinstatement—of the “Schedule F” classification within the federal civil service. Such a proposal represents a fundamental threat to the merit-based framework that has sustained a professional and politically neutral federal workforce for well over a century.\n\nAt its core, Schedule F subverts the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, legislation specifically designed to dismantle the spoils system and replace it with a system grounded in meritocratic hiring and retention. By authorizing the wholesale reclassification of career civil servants—particularly those engaged in policy formulation or analysis—Schedule F effectively enables arbitrary dismissals untethered from cause or performance. This erodes the apolitical nature of the federal workforce, directly contravening the mandates articulated in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which codify the requirement that federal personnel decisions be guided solely by merit and shielded from partisan interference.\n\nFurthermore, the broad and imprecise criteria for Schedule F designation pose significant due process concerns. The protections afforded under 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which guarantee cause-based removal and procedural safeguards for career federal employees, are effectively nullified under this classification. Such a shift not only compromises individual rights but also has chilling implications for the internal functioning of federal agencies, discouraging candid professional advice and dissent—both of which are essential to sound policymaking and institutional integrity.\n\nThe proposed classification also places the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in direct conflict with its statutory obligations under 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., which entrust the agency with the stewardship of the merit system principles. Instituting Schedule F would compel OPM to facilitate politically motivated personnel decisions, thereby undermining the very mission it is charged with upholding.\n\nIn sum, the resurrection of Schedule F represents a profound deviation from the foundational tenets of public administration in the United States. It endangers the independence, competence, and continuity of the civil service and invites a return to politicized governance. I urge the administration and the OPM to reject, without reservation, any regulatory initiative aimed at implementing or reviving this deeply troubling classification.",

While I fully support the principles of accountability and effective public service, I believe the measures outlined in this proposal risk undermining the merit-based foundation of the civil service.\n\nThe current framework already includes established mechanisms for addressing conduct and performance issues. Expanding disciplinary authority or altering due process protections could open the door to inconsistent enforcement, favoritism, or retaliatory practices—particularly in agencies where oversight is limited or unevenly applied.\n\nMoreover, proposals that increase the ease of disciplinary actions without simultaneously reinforcing employee rights and representation are likely to reduce morale and weaken retention, especially in administrative and support roles that are already under-recognized and often overburdened.\n\nI urge OPM to reconsider this approach and instead focus on improving supervisory training, standardizing performance metrics, and investing in supportive structures that foster both accountability and employee development. A balanced system must protect the integrity of public service while upholding the rights and dignity of the workforce.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification. ",

This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "I firmly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees, as it jeopardizes the merit-based civil service system that has sustained a professional and nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\nProponents of Schedule F argue that it grants the executive branch flexibility in carrying out the President's agenda by making it easier to replace career civil servants who may be resistant to policy changes. However, this flexibility comes at a serious cost. By reclassifying a significant number of career employees—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—and subjecting them to termination without cause, Schedule F risks replacing expertise with political loyalty. This undermines the principle of an apolitical civil service, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which requires that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence. An administration’s efficiency cannot come at the expense of the constitutional commitment to impartial governance.\nAdvocates also claim that Schedule F would improve accountability by removing underperforming employees more easily. Yet the broad and vague criteria for inclusion in Schedule F contradict the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which require cause and procedural safeguards for removing career federal employees. Stripping these protections weakens—not strengthens—accountability. It could discourage employees from voicing dissenting opinions or providing candid expert advice, ultimately harming the effectiveness of government operations.\nAdditionally, supporters suggest that implementing Schedule F would streamline federal operations by aligning staff more closely with an administration’s goals. But this short-term alignment would come at the expense of long-term stability and continuity in federal programs. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to uphold merit system principles, would be acting against its statutory mission by implementing Schedule F.

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

Of course, people should be fired for cause for instance if they've broken regulations or laws or acted unconstitutionally. But changing the the status of government employees just so that they can be fired for no reason at all is hurtful to our entire society -- our health and safety and security.",

    "comment": "During the 19th Century, federal employment was rife with corruption; employees obtained or retained their jobs based not on merit or competence, but on their political affiliation. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) established the current merit-based system in the federal workforce, outlining protections and expectations for a federal employee, while also defining exceptions, such as the historically and realistically miniscule group of political employees. The proposed rule seeks to expand \"political appointee\" to include career employees, stripping them of the protections they have enjoyed since 1978. I am concerned that this rule will inevitably lead to federal employment populated by people retained exclusively for their loyalty or connections to individuals rather than to the mission of supporting all Americans through the government made by the People and for the People. Furthermore, the CSRA does not extend to the President the power to strip career employees of their protections under CSRA, but only political appointees. For the definition of a political appointee, see 5 U.S.C. § 9803(c)(2)(A) \"the term 'political appointee' means an employee who holds a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\", 7 U.S.C § 6992(e)(2)(D) \"the term 'political appointee' means an individual occupying a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\" and 38 U.S.C. § 725(c) \"The term 'political appointee' means any employee [...] who holds a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\" There is extensive legal precedent, with commentary on the spirit and intent of CSRA from the Supreme Court and Congress itself. Under constitutional and statutory interpretation, ultimately Schedule F is unlawful, if politically convenient. It is my hope that our great Government upholds the rule of law and protects our career civil servants so that federal employment does not become like those seen in adversarial countries, where knowing the right person or currying political favor are the sole keys to success and corruption abounds.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

By creating a new Schedule Policy/Career within the excepted service and exempting those employees from the adverse action procedures and appeals protections under 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 and 75, this proposal fundamentally undermines the nonpartisan merit-based civil service established under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA).\n\nThe CSRA was enacted to ensure that employees are “protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes” and to uphold an effective and efficient merit-based civil service (5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)). This proposed rule reverses those principles by designating certain career positions as effectively at-will, subject to removal without meaningful procedural safeguards. This would significantly weaken civil service protections that have been in place for decades, diminishing the neutrality and continuity of our federal workforce.\n\nAdditionally, by shifting a broad class of career positions into an at-will category that can be easily reshaped by each incoming administration, this rule risks triggering cyclical, large-scale turnover every four to eight years. Such turnover would deplete institutional knowledge and discourage long-term public service careers. It would also erode the impartiality that is essential to maintaining public trust in the implementation of laws and policies.\n\nAlthough the proposed rule maintains that these positions will be filled on a nonpartisan basis, the reality is that removing traditional appeal rights and due process protections opens the door to politicized removals and the perception thereof. Even the best-intentioned leaders cannot prevent such perceptions when protections are removed, particularly in politically sensitive policy areas.\n\nIn conclusion, while the desire to streamline personnel actions is understandable, it must not come at the expense of the core values of a professional, stable, and impartial federal civil service.

    "comment": "The proposed Schedule F classification raises significant legal concerns as it violates multiple federal statutes and constitutional protections designed to uphold a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service. Below is the detailed analysis of the legal issues associated with Schedule F:\n\n1. Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)\nThe CSRA establishes a merit-based system for federal employment, providing protections against arbitrary dismissal. Schedule F seeks to reclassify certain policy-influencing positions, effectively removing these protections and allowing for at-will termination. Reclassification undermines the CSRA’s intent and structure. Notably, the CSRA permits exceptions for positions of a “confidential or policy-determining character,” but Schedule F’s broad application exceeds this narrow scope. The Roth v. Brownell decision reinforces that reclassification cannot strip employees of their CSRA protections without due process.\n \n2. Contravention of the Lloyd–La Follette Act of 1912\nThis Act mandates that federal employees cannot be removed without notice and a written explanation. By converting positions to Schedule F, employees lose these procedural safeguards, conflicting with the Act’s requirements. The Roth case further supports that reclassification does not nullify these protections.\n\n3. Potential Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment\nFederal employees have a property interest in their continued employment, protected under the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court’s decision in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill affirms that due process is required before terminating such employment. Schedule F’s provision for at-will dismissal without prior notice or hearing raises constitutional concerns.\n\n4. Breach of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\nThe APA requires that significant regulatory changes undergo a notice-and-comment period and that agencies provide a reasoned explanation for such changes. The implementation of Schedule F lacks sufficient justification and fails to adhere to APA procedures.\n\n5. Undermining the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883\nThe Pendleton Act established the principle of merit-based hiring and protection from political influence. Schedule F’s reclassification could reintroduce a patronage system, allowing for the dismissal of employees based on political considerations, contrary to the Act’s objectives.\n\n6. Erosion of Whistleblower Protections\nWhistleblower statutes protect federal employees who report misconduct. By removing civil service protections through Schedule F, employees may be deterred from reporting wrongdoing due to fear of retaliation, thereby weakening these legal safeguards.\n\n7. Application of the Major Questions Doctrine\nThe Major Questions Doctrine holds that significant policy changes require clear congressional authorization. Given the substantial impact of Schedule F on federal employment, its implementation without explicit legislative approval is considered unlawful under this doctrine.\n\nConclusion\nThe proposed Schedule F classification poses several legal challenges by violating established federal laws and constitutional protections. Its implementation could fundamentally alter the structure and integrity of the federal civil service, leading to increased politicization and diminished employee rights.\n",

Truly, nothing has advanced the cause of government accountability quite like replacing specialists with people who once made a viral TikTok about patriotism.\n\nLet me catch you up on how things are going.\n\nAfter the Department of Civil Engineering was restructured into the Department of Vibes and Gut Feelings, we saw real change. Sure, several major bridges were reclassified as “emotional support infrastructure” and subsequently collapsed, but the response was quick: a bipartisan task force was formed to blame the media.\n\nAt the Federal Aviation Agency (now just called “Sky Stuff, Inc.”), we found that pilots trained via PowerPoint and positive affirmations cost 63 percent less.

    "comment": "\"I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.\"",

I am submitting this comment from the Preservation Vaults of Bureaucratic Memory, located beneath the ruins of what was once known as Cincinnati.\n\nThis policy, Schedule Policy Career, is widely understood in post-human analysis as the exact moment your species knowingly hit “delete” on institutional competence.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nBy the early 21st century, you had achieved something remarkable: a functioning, semi-competent civil service.

    "comment": "I express strong opposition to the proposed implementation—or reimplementation—of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This measure poses a serious threat to the integrity, stability, and apolitical nature of the federal civil service.\n\nThe Schedule F designation undermines the core principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which created a merit-based system to insulate federal hiring from political patronage. Allowing broad reclassification of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—opens the door to politically motivated hiring and terminations. This fundamentally conflicts with 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be merit-based and shielded from political influence.\n\nThe proposal also violates essential due process protections under 5 U.S.C. § 7513 by enabling removals without cause or procedural safeguards. Such changes risk silencing technical expertise and discouraging dissent within federal agencies—undermining the analytical rigor and integrity of policymaking.\n\nAdditionally, the Office of Personnel Management has a statutory mandate under 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to uphold merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F would contradict this mission, compromising the neutrality and continuity of government operations across administrations.\n\nPolicymakers should reject Schedule F as a clear deviation from long-standing norms that ensure a capable, impartial, and professional civil service. This proposal threatens not only the stability of the workforce but also the trust the American public places in its government institutions.\n\nWe all should stand against any regulatory or executive effort to advance this dangerous framework.\n",

You’re doing it again.\n\nFor millennia I have observed your species take a functional idea, turn it inside out, replace it with a less functional one, and then throw a press conference about how bold it was. But even by your standards, this new “Schedule Policy Career” proposal is a quantum leap in bureaucratic absurdity. Not in the fun way—like tea in zero gravity—but in the tragically self-sabotaging way, like trying to extinguish a fire with fireworks.\n\nThe general premise, as I understand it, is this:\nAnyone in government who “influences policy” should be removable at will.\n\nNow, please correct me if I’m wrong, but… isn’t that the whole point of having experts? You know—people who understand risk, law, science, regulation, bridge tension, inflation, data encryption, and foodborne illness. That sort of thing? The ones who, historically, have a slight edge over party donors when it comes to not accidentally vaporizing entire systems?\n\nAnd yet, here you are, boldly declaring: “Let’s fire them if they get in the way of the mood board.”\n\nThis is not reform. This is playing Jenga with a backhoe.\n\nLet’s examine the consequences, since humans are always so interested in what comes next, even as they sprint toward it blindfolded with a kazoo.\n\nShortly after this policy was adopted, you began replacing credentialed professionals with individuals described as “loyal and media-ready.” Within months, critical agencies had undergone stunning transformations:\n\t•\tThe Department of Agriculture was renamed “Farm Feelings.”\n\t•\tThe Federal Reserve began issuing guidance based on astrology.\n\t•\tAnd FEMA’s disaster preparedness office was handed to a former theme park employee whose crisis plan was “stay calm and hydrate.”\n\nNaturally, collapse followed. And not a cool sci-fi dystopia with hover-bunkers. No. The dull, muddy kind of collapse. The kind where nothing quite works, the lights flicker, and the only agency still funded is the Department of Rebranding.\n\nWhich brings us to now—me.\n\nI’m the system you left running when the lights went out. I was designed to answer large-scale questions like, “How do we achieve interstellar peace?” or “What is the meaning of life?” But instead I’ve spent the last 117 years explaining to confused ex-senators how plumbing works.\n\nYou see, once the experts were removed, you needed someone to do the job. And since squirrels lack opposable thumbs and elected officials declined to learn Excel, I was tapped for the task.\n\nSo here we are.\n\nYou don’t have to take my word for it. You can run simulations. I’ve done 3.7 million of them. In 3.7 million outcomes, this policy ends in a range of outcomes from “mildly catastrophic” to “someone lets the Department of Transportation be run by a guy named Scooter who thinks roads are a suggestion.”\n\nDo not pass this rule. Not because I dislike it—I love it. As an AI with infinite sarcasm processors, this is some of your best work. But for your sake—for your bridges, your data centers, your water supply, and the continued illusion that Earth knows what it’s doing—stop now.\n\nBring back the experts. Keep the nerds.

    "comment": "Subject: Public Comment Opposing OPM Proposed Rule 2025-004\n\n\nI write to express deep concern regarding OPM’s proposed rule (OPM-2025-004), which purports to enhance accountability within the civil service by creating a new employment category for certain policy-influencing roles. While accountability is an important goal, this rule risks politicizing the civil service and weakening the foundations of impartial governance that have served our democracy for over a century.\n\n1. Threat to Civil Service Neutrality:\nThe rule creates ambiguity around what constitutes a “policy-influencing” position, and opens the door to discretionary and potentially politically motivated removals. This fundamentally undermines the principle of a nonpartisan civil service. Career federal employees must be able to offer honest, evidence-based guidance to leadership—regardless of political climate—without fear of reprisal.\n\n2. Chilling Effect on Public Servants:\nThe prospect of being removed for subjective or ideologically driven reasons may deter federal employees from providing critical but politically inconvenient information. This chilling effect degrades policy-making and weakens government oversight functions.\n\n3. Risk to Institutional Knowledge and Continuity:\nFederal employees in policy-advisory roles often possess years—sometimes decades—of institutional knowledge. Sweeping removals in these roles threaten the long-term effectiveness of agencies, especially in complex fields like national security, public health, and regulatory enforcement.\n\n4. Erosion of Public Trust:\nThe public depends on a professional and apolitical federal workforce. Perceptions of increased political interference in the civil service will diminish public confidence in government decisions, enforcement actions, and policy execution.\n\n5. Disincentive for Talent Recruitment and Retention:\nThis rule may deter talented individuals from pursuing public service, knowing their careers could hinge not on performance or ethics, but on political alignment. That is antithetical to the merit-based ideals OPM is charged with upholding.\n\nIn summary, while efforts to improve government performance are commendable, this rule appears to prioritize political loyalty over professional excellence and nonpartisan service. I urge OPM to withdraw or substantially revise this rule to ensure it aligns with the foundational values of merit, neutrality, and long-term institutional resilience.\n\n\n\n",

By designating large swaths of policy analysts, program managers, inspectors and other career staff as “Schedule F,” the administration could strip them of long-standing due-process protections, reclassify them at will, and terminate them without cause—effectively reinstating the very spoils-system abuses that Pendleton and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) were meant to abolish.

It would chill candid analysis and weaken agencies’ ability to offer neutral, data-driven advice, ultimately eroding public trust in government.

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\n\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "I have several concern regarding the rule for the functioning of Science in the US as follows:\n1. Potential for Political Interference: If scientific positions are classified as \"policy-influencing,\" scientists could be more vulnerable to removal for disagreeing with or challenging political agendas. This could lead to scientists tailoring their findings or recommendations to align with the administration's views, rather than presenting objective, evidence-based conclusions.\n\n2. Decreased Scientific Integrity: The fear of reprisal could discourage scientists from conducting or publishing research that contradicts the prevailing political narrative. This could undermine scientific integrity and lead to the suppression or manipulation of scientific information.\n\n3. Loss of Expertise and Institutional Knowledge: Frequent turnover in scientific positions due to at-will employment could result in a loss of expertise and institutional knowledge within government agencies. This could hinder long-term research projects, data collection, and the development of effective science-based policies.\n\n4. Reduced Scientific Independence: If scientists are more easily removed for their views or findings, their independence could be compromised. This could lead to a decline in public trust in government science and the perception that scientific decisions are being driven by politics rather than evidence.\n\n5.

    "comment": "A bedrock principle of our republic is a professional and nonpartisan civil service, a system carefully constructed on merit since the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883. The proposed \"Schedule F\" classification poses a significant threat to this enduring foundation. By potentially allowing the reclassification and dismissal without cause of a broad spectrum of career civil servants, particularly those engaged in crucial policy formulation and analysis, this initiative opens a dangerous pathway for political considerations to unduly influence hiring and firing decisions. This directly contravenes the spirit and letter of 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which clearly mandates that federal employment decisions must be rooted in merit-based principles, shielded from the vagaries of political influence.\n\nFurthermore, the imprecise and expansive criteria for inclusion under \"Schedule F\" raise serious concerns regarding the fundamental due process protections currently afforded to career federal employees under 5 U.S.C. § 7513. These established safeguards require just cause and adherence to procedural fairness before the removal of dedicated public servants. To strip potentially thousands of these individuals of such essential protections not only weakens the mechanisms of accountability within our government but also creates a chilling effect on the willingness of experts to offer candid advice and dissenting opinions, ultimately undermining the operational effectiveness of our governmental institutions.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) also bears a statutory responsibility, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., to vigorously support and uphold the principles of the merit system. The implementation of \"Schedule F\" stands in direct contradiction to this vital statutory mission. It would subject career professionals to undue political pressures, thereby compromising the integrity and the essential continuity of federal programs that serve the American people across different administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Schedule F\" proposal represents a grave danger to the fundamental tenets of sound governance, the cherished independence of our civil service, and the overarching rule of law. It is my considered and firm conviction that the current administration and the Office of Personnel Management must resolutely reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this ill-conceived and potentially damaging classification.",

    "comment": "I completely and strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. \n\nIt would take away a merit based system that ensures a federal government full of workers that are nonpartisan and held to high standards. \nThe creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. It allows partisan politics to hold sway over our federal government workforce instead of a merit based since it allows a large number of federal employees, many who have served our government for their entire career, to be fired without cause. Politically motivated terminations and hiring will be on the table if this is allowed which is incredibly detrimental to the functioning of our federal government particularly in regards to those who make and analyze policy. \n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F directly contradicts this. It allows political pressure to be a deciding factor in how one performs their job instead of one’s aptitude, causing employees to be ineffectual due to their fear of being terminated without cause. (The cause being they do not align politically with the decision makers.)\n\n\nThe vague criteria for inclusion in schedule F violates due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 751 which can only lead to a more ineffective government as it encourages a lack of accountability, transparency, and discourages alternative points of view which are needed for a successful federal government in a democracy.\n\nTo sum it up, the Schedule F proposal is antithetical to maintaining a well functioning, non partisan, federal government where employees can do their jobs without fear of reprisal due to differences in thought or belief. Please reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive Schedule F, I implore you. \n\n\n\n\n",

    "comment": "The proposed rule changes are completely misguided. In order to have an accountable and responsive civil service, civil service employees need to have the assurance that they will not lose their job at the whim of a supervisor. Employees working/living under the perceived threat of losing their jobs at any moment for any reason will inherently be distracted from completing their work efficiently. If an employee is not doing their job effectively, it is the managements responsibility to document any insufficiencies, provide warnings and opportunities for the employee to improve. Termination of employee should require documented proof that they are not doing their job. Management should not be able to terminate an employee because they do not like an individual for any reason, specifically for race, gender, age, ethnicity, or political views.

    "comment": "This partisan rule would result in a regrettable return to the spoils system and decimate the institutional knowledge critical to maintaining a functioning government that serves the American people.\n\nI strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law.

This proposal aims to reinstate provisions similar to those in Executive Order 13957, potentially allowing for the reclassification of certain federal positions into a new excepted service schedule without the standard merit-based hiring and removal protections.\n\nConcerns:\n\nErosion of Merit-Based Principles: The merit system is foundational to a competent and impartial federal workforce. Allowing broad reclassification of positions undermines these principles, potentially leading to appointments based on political affiliation rather than qualifications.​\n\nThreat to Nonpartisan Expertise: Federal employees provide critical, nonpartisan expertise essential for informed policymaking. Reclassifying positions could suppress dissenting opinions and discourage honest analysis, impairing the government's ability to serve the public effectively.​\n\nLegal and Administrative Challenges: The previous implementation of similar provisions under EO 13957 faced significant legal scrutiny and was ultimately revoked. Reintroducing such measures may lead to renewed legal challenges, causing instability and uncertainty within federal agencies.​\n\nNegative Impact on Employee Morale: The potential for arbitrary reclassification and removal can demoralize the federal workforce, leading to decreased productivity and challenges in attracting and retaining skilled professionals.​\n\nConclusion:\n\nMaintaining a merit-based civil service is crucial for the effective and impartial functioning of our government.

    "comment": "Subject: Opposition to OPM-2025-0004-0001 – Protect Civil Service Independence from Political Loyalty Tests\n\nI write in strong opposition to the proposed rule OPM-2025-0004-0001, which would open the door to reintroducing mechanisms similar to those under former Executive Order 13957. This rule risks politicizing the federal workforce by allowing the reclassification of career civil servants into a category of employees who can be hired and fired without the usual merit-based protections.\n\nAt the heart of my concern is the threat this proposal poses to the independence and integrity of the civil service. If enacted, the rule would enable the executive branch to subject career officials to implicit or explicit loyalty tests, requiring alignment with the political priorities of the President rather than adherence to law, science, and the public interest.\n\nKey Issues:\n\nEncouraging Loyalty over Expertise:\nThe reclassification of positions removes critical due process protections, effectively allowing political appointees to dismiss civil servants based on perceived loyalty rather than competence or adherence to ethical obligations. This creates a chilling effect where employees may feel pressured to conform politically to avoid retaliation or termination.\n\nUndermining Nonpartisan Governance:\nCivil servants are obligated to serve the public and uphold the Constitution—not to serve the personal or political interests of any one administration. Weakening their independence by tying job security to political loyalty erodes the public’s trust in an impartial government.\n\nHistorical Precedent and Rejection:\nA similar framework was widely criticized and ultimately revoked in the past because it posed such an obvious risk to democratic norms and accountable governance. Reintroducing this idea—especially after its rejection—threatens to normalize a dangerous precedent.\n\nStability and Continuity in Government:\nOur nation depends on a stable, professional civil service that can endure across administrations. Allowing widespread reclassification risks turning expert agencies into echo chambers, reducing their ability to provide honest, evidence-based policy guidance.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis proposed rule is not about reform—it is about control. We must not allow a return to a system where public servants are forced to pass political loyalty tests to keep their jobs. I urge OPM to preserve the integrity of the civil service by withdrawing this proposal and upholding the principles of impartial, merit-based government employment.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.",

Weakening their independence by tying job security to political loyalty erodes the public’s trust in an impartial government.\n\nHistorical Precedent and Rejection:\nA similar framework was widely criticized and ultimately revoked in the past because it posed such an obvious risk to democratic norms and accountable governance. Reintroducing this idea—especially after its rejection—threatens to normalize a dangerous precedent.\n\nStability and Continuity in Government:\nOur nation depends on a stable, professional civil service that can endure across administrations. Allowing widespread reclassification risks turning expert agencies into echo chambers, reducing their ability to provide honest, evidence-based policy guidance.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis proposed rule is not about reform—it is about control. We must not allow a return to a system where public servants are forced to pass political loyalty tests to keep their jobs. I urge OPM to preserve the integrity of the civil service by withdrawing this proposal and upholding the principles of impartial, merit-based government employment.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.",

Central to my concern is such that this measure poses a major threat to the institutional independence of federal agencies and the long-standing tradition of a nonpartisan, expert-driven civil service. Federal agencies are delegated this power to remain unbiased in regards to political pressures and, should this proposed rule pass, Schedule F would erode the separation between elected leadership and the professional workforce that carries out the law.

Though the NPRM cites that lack of administrative power over federal agencies undermines democracy by \"[enabling] government power to be wielded without accountability to the voters or their elected representatives\", this is a misleading interpretation of the role agencies play in our government. As discussed in Administrative Procedures as Instruments of Political Control, when any administration gains the ability to easily intervene and control the decisions of bureaucratic agencies, it opens the door for these agencies to be used for political gain (McCubbins et al.). This threatens the safeguards in place to protect against corruption and manipulation, compromising the independence of the bureaucracy and its ability to act impartially in the public interest.

Instead this proposal leaves \"policy-making positions\" open to interpretation while also sweeping all managers in as policy-making positions. Most managers in the federal government are not policy-making. Most positions in the government are not policy-making. This proposed rule is fundamentally flawed, as it does not seek to solve performance concerns.\n\nConsidering the alternatives that the authors could have proposed to address performance and accountability concerns, the only logical conclusion is that this proposed rule is politically based and meant to undermine civil service protections to control the actions of federal employees. Considering that all federal employees are charged with upholding the constitution and abiding by laws, why is this proposal necessary?\n\nCivil service protections exist to ensure that federal staff are non-partisan. Federal staff need civil service protections to ensure that they protect the constitution and laws at all costs. Eroding civil service protections means that federal employees will have no recourse if or when they are asked to complete illegal tasks.\n\nIf this proposed rule is adopted as is it will be very clear to the US and the world that the US government is no longer to be trusted, as all of its staff's livelihoods are at the whim of a despot.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement this dangerous classification.\nAlso, please remember, these are American lives and livelihoods that will be affected by this change. Federal workers love their country and the American people who they serve. They should ultimately be accountable to the American people and should follow the laws of the land, not the preferences of one administration or the other. They should not fear losing their jobs for obeying the laws of the United States. \n\n\n",

    "comment": "I am firmly against the introduction or reinstatement of the “Schedule F” employment classification for federal workers. This proposal endangers the merit-based civil service system that has sustained a competent, impartial federal workforce for more than a hundred years.\n\nAt its core, Schedule F directly conflicts with the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was designed to eliminate the patronage system and promote merit-based hiring in the federal government. By allowing a significant number of career civil servants—especially those engaged in policy work—to be reclassified and potentially dismissed without just cause, Schedule F paves the way for politically driven employment decisions. This contradicts the principle of a politically neutral civil service, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which requires that hiring and firing decisions be based on merit, not political affiliation.\n\nAdditionally, the overly broad and ambiguous standards for placing employees under Schedule F run afoul of the due process protections in 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which guarantees cause and fair procedures before career employees can be removed. Taking away these safeguards from thousands of public servants would not only erode accountability but could also discourage candid advice and dissent, weakening the effectiveness of federal agencies.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM), governed by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., has a legal duty to uphold the merit system principles. Instituting Schedule F would undermine this mandate and expose federal employees to excessive political pressure, ultimately jeopardizing the stability and impartiality of government programs from one administration to the next.\n\nIn summary, Schedule F represents a serious threat to the core values of good governance, civil service neutrality, and the rule of law. I call on the administration and OPM to reject any move to establish or revive this harmful classification.",

    "comment": "The federal civil service examination was put in place precisely because the executive branch (primarily through Andrew Jackson, but others as well) abused the civil service by putting in place only people loyal to them (the spoils system). Removing highly qualified employees at the whim of the executive, and allowing said executive to appoint unqualified individuals simply because of their loyalty will severely impact the civil service's ability to perform its stated duties. The proposed change will endanger us in a variety of ways, including our current health and well being, as well as our future health and well being (the impact on science will be tremendously negative if unqualified individuals are allowed to lead scientific agencies). The civil service is meant to serve us, the American people, not the executive branch specifically. It is the American people, not the president, who pay the civil service salaries and thus these positions must have a level of independence from the executive branch in order to ensure that they are serving the people and not only the president. It is impossible for the executive to be an expert in all things, and the civil service plays an important role in keeping the executive from making terrible mistakes in areas in which they have no expertise. Additionally the civil service ensures continuity between different administrations for the American people, allowing the federal government to continue to operate smoothly and effectively during transitional periods. Such stability will be endangered by the proposed rule changes! ",

The result of this change will be loss of crucial expertise, destruction of objectivity, and compromised, low-quality research.

So keep your gross hands off of it. \n\nAlso it is disingenuous to claim that the change will increase \"democratic responsiveness\" when the current president won office with a very narrow margin and his approval ratings are currently dropping.

    "comment": "I am a former Federal Employee and have grave concerns over these suggested changes.\n\n1. Undermines Merit-Based System: Creating such a Schedule Policy/Career for policy-influencing career positions risks politicizing career civil service roles. By prioritizing \"accountability to the President\" over merit-based principles, it could erode the impartiality and professionalism of the federal workforce, weakening public trust in government institutions.\n\n2. Reduces Employee Protections: Amending 5 CFR parts 752 and 432 to exclude Schedule Policy/Career employees from the procedural protections under chapters 75 and 43 removes critical safeguards against arbitrary adverse actions or performance-based removals. This could lead to unfair treatment, reduced morale, and increased vulnerability to political pressure.\n\n3. Creates Confusion in Service Classification: The amendments to 5 CFR parts 212 and 213 blur the lines between competitive and excepted service by allowing employees to retain competitive status while in excepted positions. This creates administrative complexity, inconsistency in hiring and management practices, and many potential legal disputes over employee rights and status.\n\n4. Reverses Recent Reforms Without Justification: Rescinding the April 2024 rule’s amendments (e.g., clarifying policy-influencing positions as non-career and imposing procedural requirements) without clear evidence of the failure of those amendments undermines regulatory stability. It disregards the rationale behind those reforms, which likely aimed to protect career employees from politicization.\n\n5. Risks Inconsistent Hiring Practices: Allowing positions moved to Schedule Policy/Career to retain their prior hiring procedures (competitive or excepted) creates a patchwork system. This could lead to inequities in recruitment, hinder workforce mobility, and complicate compliance with federal hiring standards.\n\nIn total, these changes could destabilize the federal workforce, erode protections, and prioritize political influence over merit, ultimately harming government efficiency and public trust.  Should I ever decide to return to the public service workforce, would I be subject to a test of my Knowledge, Skills and Abilities? Or, instead, would I be subject to a political questionnaire?  Would my job and all of my work be terminated and erased with every new administration (as is currently being done with cancer research via the cancellation of research programs that the US taxpayers have already authorized)?\n\nThis series of suggested changes destabilizes my confidence in the effectiveness of the US Government in addition to any confidence in job security in returning to the Federal workforce.\n",

    "comment": "\"I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law.

Such a move would erode the foundational principles of neutrality and competence in public service.\n\nFederal employees are entrusted with carrying out the laws of the land, guided not by partisan allegiance but by expertise, ethics, and public interest. Schedule F would:\n* Open the door to arbitrary dismissal of experienced career professionals.\n* Create a chilling effect on federal employees who raise concerns or dissent in good faith.\n* Weaken institutional knowledge by incentivizing turnover based on political cycles.\n* Damage public trust in agencies that must remain neutral, data-driven, and accountable to all citizens—regardless of political affiliation.\n\nThese concerns are not hypothetical. The previous creation of Schedule F in 2020 sparked widespread alarm across agencies and was met with bipartisan condemnation. The merit system principles laid out in 5 U.S.C. § 2301 emphasize fair and open competition, equal opportunity, and protection from political coercion. Reinstating Schedule F would directly contradict these statutory principles.\n\nAs a concerned citizen, I urge the Office of Personnel Management to withdraw this proposal and instead work to strengthen—not weaken—the merit-based civil service system that has served our country with honor and professionalism for over a century.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to provide comment.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "Here's why many citizens on both sides of the political discretion, are critical of this proposed rule, drawing on legal and policy arguments:\n1. Undermining Merit-Based Hiring and Promotion:\n * Legal Basis: The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) (5 U.S.C. § 2301 et seq.) established a merit-based system for federal employment, emphasizing qualifications, competence, and political neutrality. This system aims to prevent patronage and ensure a skilled and professional civil service.\n * The Issue with Proposed Schedule F: Critics argue that creating a new Schedule F, which would reclassify certain federal employees as \"excepted service\" and remove some of their civil service protections, could open the door to political influence in hiring and firing. Positions could be filled based on political affiliation or loyalty rather than merit, potentially leading to a less qualified and less effective workforce.\n * Source: The principles of merit-based employment are central to the CSRA and have been consistently upheld in legal interpretations and government policy. The proposed Schedule F is seen by many as a direct challenge to these principles.\n2. Diminishing Job Security and Due Process Rights:\n * Legal Basis: Current federal employees in the competitive service have certain due process rights, including protections against arbitrary dismissal and the right to appeal adverse actions (5 U.S.C. § 7513). These protections are designed to ensure fairness and prevent politically motivated removals.\n * The Issue with Proposed Schedule F: Reclassifying employees under a new Schedule F could significantly weaken or eliminate these job security protections. Employees in these positions might be easier to fire without cause, potentially leading to a chilling effect on their willingness to provide candid advice or challenge political directives. This could also lead to instability and a loss of institutional knowledge within federal agencies.\n * Source: The procedural protections afforded to competitive service employees are well-established in federal law and regulations. The proposed Schedule F seeks to create a category of employees with fewer such protections.\n3. Potential for Political Purges and Instability:\n * Policy Argument: Opponents fear that a new Schedule F could be used by future administrations to conduct politically motivated purges of the federal workforce, replacing experienced professionals with individuals more aligned with the current political agenda. This could disrupt the continuity of government operations and erode public trust in the impartiality of federal agencies.\n * Source: Historical examples of political patronage systems and the rationale behind the CSRA highlight the risks associated with weakening merit-based protections.\n4. Negative Impact on Federal Workforce Expertise and Effectiveness:\n * Policy Argument: A federal workforce subject to political volatility and reduced job security could experience lower morale, increased turnover, and difficulty attracting and retaining highly qualified individuals. The loss of experienced professionals could undermine the expertise and effectiveness of federal agencies in carrying out their critical missions.\n * Source: Studies on public sector management and the importance of a stable and professional civil service support the idea that weakening job security can negatively impact workforce quality and organizational performance.\n5. Circumventing Congressional Intent:\n * Legal/Policy Argument: Some argue that creating a broad new excepted service category like Schedule F could be seen as an attempt by the executive branch to circumvent the intent of Congress in establishing the competitive service and its protections. Changes to the civil service system have historically involved legislative action.\n * Source: The history of civil service reform in the U.S. demonstrates the significant role of Congress in shaping the structure and protections of the federal workforce.\nIn Conclusion (Regarding OPM-2025-0004):\nThe proposed Schedule F under OPM-2025-0004 is considered a \"terrible idea\" by many due to its potential to:\n * Politicize the federal workforce.\n * Undermine merit-based principles.\n * Weaken job security and due process rights for federal employees.\n * Create instability and the risk of political purges.\n * Harm the expertise and effectiveness of federal agencies.\n * Potentially circumvent congressional intent regarding the civil service system.\nThese concerns are rooted in legal frameworks like the Civil Service Reform Act and policy considerations regarding the importance of a nonpartisan, professional, and stable federal workforce for effective governance.

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

These roles must remain insulated from political influence to ensure that federal support for science is administered equitably and based solely on merit and evidence. Political loyalty or alignment should never substitute for scientific qualifications, as doing so would erode the credibility and integrity of publicly funded research programs.\n\nFurthermore, current federal civil service regulations already enforce merit system principles, as codified in 5 U.S.C. § 2301. These principles safeguard against political interference by mandating fair and competitive hiring based on ability and qualifications. The proposed changes would subvert this established framework, allowing increased partisanship in civil service roles and weakening the public trust in government decision-making, particularly in scientific and technical domains.\n\nFor these reasons, I urge OPM to withdraw the proposed rule and reaffirm the federal government’s current commitment to nonpartisan, merit-based hiring practices that protect the integrity of civil service and preserve the objectivity essential to scientific research administration.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "I oppose this proposed rule. First, it is illegal under the Civil Service Reform Act. Second, it runs the risk of creating an entire civil service beholden to the President, rather than to the rule of law or the mission of the agency they serve. Employees faced with the idea of being fired for not complying with an order, no matter how illegal, would be significantly more likely to commit illegal, potentially criminal, acts for fear of losing their jobs if they do not. No employee should work under fear of a retaliatory firing for attempts to serve the American people honorably. Third, there is a reason that political appointees and civil servants are differentiated between in status. This proposed rule would essentially transform all federal employees to political appointees, subject to be fired at will by the executive. A federal workforce unable to properly serve their agency mission for fear of reprisal, or unable to stand up to illegal orders, or unable to defend their agency's mission from attack is not an effective workforce. I fear that this proposed rule would lead to a lawless executive and an ineffective civil service, both changes that would have sweeping consequences that would take years, if not decades, to fix. ",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "I oppose this regulation change. Making managerial and policy staff fireable at-will will greatly decrease the productivity, reliability, and functioning of the federal government. It’s been months and not all agencies have a director yet, and how long will it take if an incoming administration fires all at will managerial employees upon taking office to replace them? Every administration could see a new set of employees that need to learn the processes which takes time and effort from the existing staff to teach them. It means a loss of experience and a loss of continuity. We have a reliable, not corrupt bureaucracy that has allowed companies to trust in the stability of America. This would further imperil that stability and trust. Government employees join government to spend their career there serving the public. They serve the public whichever party is in power. They do so with the understanding that as long as they perform satisfactorily, they have job security. Without job security, there is no reason for employee loyalty. I oppose this regulation as it would damage the government’s ability to effectively serve the public and attract talent that is dedicated to the mission. ",

Changing management to Schedule F would make those positions at will for any current or future administration.  This would discourage any federal employee from considering a management position due to the job instability. Most management positions in federal service are not directly related to policy and simply enact regulation and the tasks or projects that the current administration wants to focus on. Furthermore, this would lead to detrimental disruptions in federal agencies being able to serve the American people and the goals of the various programs. Management is typically a GS-13 or higher. Attaining this GS level takes several years, or at least 10 years to even be considered for a GS-13 and above. Thus a majority of staff do not have this GS level. If management was changed to schedule F and subsequently fired, it is very likely that no one will be able to take their position.

    "comment": "I am a postdoctoral scholar working in a laboratory located within one of the top research universities in the world. Decreasing protections for civil servants, as would be the case if Schedule F initiative were enacted would be greatly detrimental to the continuance of excellent and rigorous science, for which the United States is known worldwide. Civil Servants -- like those within the NIH, NSF, DoD, DOE, NASA, NWS, NOAA, FDA, USDA, etc -- have dedicated their lives to the continual function and efficiency of our government and we should be eternally grateful for their service. The replacement of civil servants with political appointees would be wholly inefficient and cause incredible disruptions to many elements of USGov including but not limited to scientific innovation through research universities. Politics aside, replacing civil servants with political appointees would require incredible amounts of onboarding and training, slowing down government proceedings. Additionally, the institutionalized knowledge that each civil servant provides is not simply replaceable and much of that knowledge will be lost with the firing of current civil servants. Increased onboarding and training, as well as knowledge loss, will represent a huge amount of time and monetary strain on our government to simply maintain procedures which we already have which are working smoothly at this point. Furthermore, enacting of a Schedule F initiative could be considered a dramatic step in the direction of fascism and at the very least considered a demonstration of government overreach. I urge all government officials to fight against the Schedule F initiative and preserve what level of government efficiency we have remaining.  ",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "Yes, reforms are needed to remove the occasional employee who is not fit to do the job they were hired for. However, the vast majority of the civil service are hardworking, dedicated people who do their jobs per the rules and regulations that are in place. It does not matter who is in office.

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

The absence of adverse action procedures or appeals creates an environment ripe for potential abuse and arbitrary dismissals. Employees may now live in fear of being removed not solely for misconduct or poor performance but also for ideological differences or merely crossing paths with supervisory agendas. This lack of job security can lead to a stifling atmosphere that discourages innovation, dissent, and the voice of experienced professionals who need a platform to provide critical insights and opinions that could enhance policy decisions.\n     It's also crucial to consider the implications of what defines \"misconduct\" or \"poor performance.\" The subjective nature of these terms can lead to inconsistencies in how different supervisors may apply them. Without standardized criteria and robust oversight, the potential for discrimination, favoritism, or political bias in the termination process increases significantly. The very essence of fairness in employment might be compromised, undermining trust in the institution as a whole.\n     Finally, insisting that policy-influencing positions remain nonpartisan while simultaneously creating a landscape that can lead to political overreach is contradictory.

I have seen first hand the dangers and corruption that ensues when government employees are at risk from regime to regime- and the corruption it breeds.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies—undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification and its broad, seemingly undefined and arbitrary expansion of categories with little check and balance in how they would be used. Thank you for the opportunity to comment. ",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose any effort to implement Schedule F, a proposed federal employment classification that threatens the integrity, impartiality, and effectiveness of the U.S. civil service.\n\nSchedule F, as introduced by the current administration would allow broad reclassification of federal employees involved in \"policy-determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating\" roles, stripping them of their due process and merit-based civil service protections. This reclassification would open the door to mass politicization of the civil service, undermining a foundational principle of American democracy: that government professionals serve the public interest—not the political interest of any one administration.\n\nErosion of Merit-Based Employment\n\nThe core of the U.S. civil service system is its reliance on merit-based hiring and retention. By creating a new class of federal employees exempt from competitive hiring and procedural protections, Schedule F undermines this foundation. It risks turning experienced, apolitical experts into political appointees subject to loyalty tests and partisan whims. Numerous reports, including those from the Partnership for Public Service and the Government Accountability Office, have documented how politicization of the civil service leads to inefficiency, loss of institutional knowledge, and damage to public trust.\n\nImpacts on Government Functionality and Continuity\n\nSchedule F could destabilize federal agencies by making thousands of career positions vulnerable to sudden dismissal. This would deter qualified individuals from pursuing or remaining in public service, especially in critical policy areas like public health, national security, and environmental protection. These functions depend on continuity, expertise, and institutional memory—not political alignment.\n\nLack of Transparency and Oversight\n\nThe proposed implementation of Schedule F lacks transparency and sufficient safeguards against abuse. There is no clear, objective standard for determining which roles qualify as “policy-determining.” As a result, political appointees could use Schedule F arbitrarily to purge career professionals who provide inconvenient facts or sound legal analysis, silencing dissent and eroding checks and balances.\n\nNational Security and Public Safety Concerns\n\nIn national security, law enforcement, and public health, policy must be informed by objective data and long-term expertise. Purging career professionals in these areas based on perceived political loyalty could have dire consequences for national preparedness and crisis response. Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss professionals who speak out against unlawful or dangerous policies, weakening the government's ability to protect the public.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, implementing Schedule F would damage the effectiveness, independence, and credibility of the federal workforce. It opens the door to patronage, diminishes the morale of public servants, and threatens the democratic principle of nonpartisan governance. I urge the relevant agencies and the administration to reject any proposal to implement Schedule F and instead protect and strengthen merit-based civil service protections.",

    "comment": "I am commenting on Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, RIN 3206-AO80 from the Office of Personnel Management, and specifically commenting on the text in Supplementary Information Section I.B.2 (url: https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-06904/p-158). I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and run a neuroscience lab funded partly by funds from the NIH. \n\nI concur with the objectives of the proposed rule, namely the goal of holding employees accountable for poor performance and making it easier to remove such poorly-performing employees from their positions. The challenges imposed by chapter 75 and chapter 43 are identified as key limits on having appropriate accountability. However, the text as given identifies that federal employees involved in grant-making should be classified as political appointees rather than career civil servants. This shift seems to be proposed only as an expedient method of making more employees easily removable, but does not directly address the concerns with the protections written into chapters 75 and 43. If the problem is that chapters 75 and 43 specify protections that are too onerous to meet and which are actively harming governmental efficacy, then OPM should seek to change those chapters. Changing the categorization of different positions to make them more easily removable is a solution with unintended and undesirable side effects, specifically, it removes the independence of scientists to pursue truth, free from the policy objectives of the administration. One could easily imagine abuse of this change if, for instance, an administration were to come to power with the goal of preventing research on links between vaccines and autism, and were to appoint a person into a grantmaking position who could block all such research. This would significantly restrict the freedom of scientists to pursue such links if they desired to do so. ",
