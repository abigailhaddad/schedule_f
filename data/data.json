We need devoted public servants to be supported in doing their jobs, and for those jobs to be stable. This rule would further undermine our functioning government, be an affront to workers, and undermine faith in our government overall.",

    "comment": "this is a terrible idea. The underlying logic of this proposal is that, 1) all federal employees, no matter where they are located or what they do, must first and foremost be loyal to the President. This is, of course, patently ridiculous. 2) It implies that anyone can do any Federal employee's job; there is no requirement for institutional knowledge or specialization, or years of experience. This, too, is patently ridiculous. Federal employees hold positions ranging from lower-level (security guards and janitors, for example) to highly educated and experienced roles (research scientists and administrators). In any of these roles, Federal employees need to first perform the duties of the position to the level expected in their performance documents. As part of that review process, they should not be working against the government, no matter who the President is at the time. However, allegiance to that President above all else, as implied here, is UNAMERICAN and ACONSITUIONAL.\n\nIf implemented, it would move us further into authoritarianism with Federal employees whose allegiance, rather than skill, earns them employment. It would weaken services and disrupt our national security. None of this improves Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service; rather, it would destroy the Civil Service.",

Recent leaked Schedule F lists from NOAA disproportionately identify scientists and science leadership, rather than people who make policy! 2) Accountability must apply across the board and not just middle-management, which is what this will ultimately affect not the low performing employee, but likely the high performing boss of that employee, concurrently, very senior leadership or senior executives will engage in self preservation will be further politicized and become corrupt and divorced from the mission. All you will get is a fearful and incompetent workforce, which is perhaps what this regulation aims to do, and 3) Due process is built into every regulation/law in the United States, and violating the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) covering due process.

    "comment": "Converting scientific positions into political appointees makes no more sense that hiring firefighters, waiters, or plumbers because of their favorite color - it's irrelevant and can have only one possible effect on science: it will hinder progress and waste money (because appointees will spend tax dollars on poorly-conceived, outdated, impossible, or already-addressed scientific directions). The US is a world-leader in science - everyone agrees that we lead the way in nearly all domains. That dominance is due to continued, long term smart investment in science and scientists. Political appointees in this domain would constitute a shockingly wasteful and partisan change. Because science touches all our lives in terms of medicine, business, policy, agriculture, policing, technology, weather, immigration, the economy, and so much more, this will quite literally eventually cost lives. Political appointees do not belong at the NSF. ",

    "comment": "I object to OPM's proposed new rule that would reclassify 50,000 federal workers to \"at-will\" employees. \"At-will\" employment will make it easier to fire any employee for political rather than merit-based reasons. Under \"at-will\" employment, no reason is required for termination. And, there is little recourse for appeal. \n\nUS civil servants are not political appointees and as such are not subject to removal by Presidential authority. The Civil Service was established to create a professional, non-partisan workforce rather than one based on cronyism. Fealty to the President and his agenda should never be a condition of civil service employment and yet, this is exactly what this proposed regulation seeks to establish. The regulation authors say the reclassification will make it easier to fire employees for \"intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\" This is moving our government further in the direction of a dictatorship. This reclassification effort is a huge over-reach by the Executive Branch which will undermine the federal workforce and reduce public trust in government. \n\nAnother reason given for changing civil servants to at-will employees is that the current protections employees enjoy (e.g., a fair workplace) purportedly makes it difficult \"to hold employees accountable.\" If that is the case, improve the evaluation system. \n\nThe drafters of this rule assert that \"positions will remain career jobs filled on a non-partisan basis.\" This is a disingenuous claim. At-will employment undermines career employment. Job security and due process for employees are critical assurances to those who seek a career job in the federal government. These do not rule out a robust training and evaluation program to ensure good job performance. \n\nIn addition, the assertion that one can be fired without due process for \"intentionally subverting Presidential directives\" undermines the professional, non-partisan character of civil service positions. The message is clear. Obey or be gone. No professional person would choose to work under such conditions. Our government has long upheld model employment regulations. Let's not abandon our commitment to a fair working conditions for a President's political gain.",

To ignore this context and consider only the narrow technicalities of the proposal would either be willful blindness or purposeful manipulation of the rule-making process by those who naively and selfishly believe they will receive some favor from the would-be king.
