      "Merit-based system concerns",
      "Due process/employee rights",
      "Politicization concerns"
    ],
    "key_quote": "The proposed rule is not only bad policy but also likely unlawful. It threatens to erode the apolitical nature of the civil service, bypasses core legal protections enshrined in the CSRA and the Constitution, and grants the Executive Branch undue power over career personnel.",
    "rationale": "The comment clearly opposes the proposed rule, citing legal conflicts with existing civil service protections and due process rights, as well as concerns about politicization and potential abuse of power."
