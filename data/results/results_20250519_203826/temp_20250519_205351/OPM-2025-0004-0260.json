      "Merit-based system concerns",
      "Due process/employee rights",
      "Politicization concerns",
      "Institutional knowledge loss"
    ],
    "key_quote": "Removing the prerequisite protections that federal workers have in regard to not being \"fired at will\", and \"unable to speak truth to authority\" for \"fear of losing their job\", will create a spoils system that will reward unethical, illegal, and immoral behavior and subsequently fail to provide the very services our fellow Americans paid their taxes to receive.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the potential negative consequences on federal workers' rights, institutional integrity, and the overall functioning of government services."
