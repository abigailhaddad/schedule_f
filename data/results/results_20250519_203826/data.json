As one of the 50,000 federal employees who could lose my job as a consequence of Schedule Policy/Career, I strongly oppose this rulemaking. Despite OPM\u2019s assurances to the contrary, I fear that officials in the current administration, or in a future administration, will exploit Schedule Policy/Career to facilitate \u201cmass head-count reductions in the federal bureaucracy.\u201d 1Given my experience, I am under no illusions that anything I say will persuade OPM to abandon its implementation of amended Executive Order 13957 and Schedule Policy/Career. Indeed, OPM has telegraphed that a reversal isn\u2019t happening, asserting that it \u201cmust comport with\u201d Executive Order 13957 and that \u201c[d]eclining to help the President execute this directive would be a dereliction of OPM\u2019s statutory duty.\u201d Fair enough; it would be unrealistic to expect OPM to 2second-guess an executive order issued by the current President. Accordingly, feds like me will pin our hopes on the judicial branch, which will independently assess whether the Trump administration\u2019s novel reinterpretation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 is the \u201cbest reading\u201d of that statute under Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2266 (2024). 3While the outcome of this rulemaking may be preordained, I have written this comment for one important purpose. Taking advantage of the candor afforded by anonymity, I hope to refute the disparaging suspicion of federal employees at the heart of Executive Order 14171\u2014not only to underscore that this initiative is unnecessary, but to convey to Trump administration officials that  Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, The DOGE Plan to Reform Government, Wall Street Journal (Nov. 120, 2024), https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020. 90 FR 17200, 17218.2 As a regulatory analyst, it would be supremely ironic if the Loper Bright decision ends up saving my 3job. 1\nthey can trust in the capability and professionalism of career policy staff. Whether you believe it or not, we are here to help you.  However, trust is a two-way street, and OPM has done much to diminish its credibility in the initial months of this administration. To the extent OPM is sincere in promising that \u201cemployees 4who faithfully perform their jobs to the best of their ability have little to fear from Schedule Policy/Career,\u201d I urge OPM to implement meaningful safeguards beyond those included in its 5NPRM\u2014in particular, language that would prohibit the arbitrary firing or mass firing of Schedule Policy/Career employees. Such safeguards would demonstrate OPM\u2019s sincerity about the stated intent of amended Executive Order 13957\u2014i.e., holding bad actors accountable\u2014while mitigating some of its harms. A Solution in Search of a Problem Before getting into the details of the NPRM, I wish to share my perspective as a federal employee who will likely be reclassified into Schedule Policy/Career, retaining my anonymity for obvious reasons. For context, I previously commented in support of OPM\u2019s 2024 rule and was quoted at length in the preamble of that rule.  6As I described in my earlier comment, I am a GS-13 regulatory analyst who works in the \u201cOffice of Policy\u201d of a prominent federal agency. For better or worse, my agency engages in some of the most contentious policy work in the federal government. For example, my agency\u2019s policy priorities change dramatically depending on the political party in charge of the Presidency. Our rulemakings typically attract thousands of comments and have been the subject of Congressional committee hearings. Adverse stakeholders challenge our rules and sub-regulatory guidance in court, with disputes occasionally reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. My \u201csubstantive participation\u201d in this contested policy work is important and exciting, but given its sensitivity, I 7am scrupulous to maintain the effort, professionalism, and objectivity expected of a taxpayer-funded federal employee. As a career analyst, I have worked closely and successfully with political appointees under the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations to issue regulations and policy guidance consistent with the policy priorities of those administrations. Naturally, I have personal opinions about the policy work I do, and I sometimes disagree with my politically appointed leaders about specific  See, e.g., Eric Katz, As Re-Firings Begin, Judge Demands Trump Administration Tell Probationary 4Employees They Were Not Let Go for Poor Performance, Politico (April 21, 2025), https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/opm-firing-probationary-federal-agency-employees-judge-ruling-00206615; Billy Mitchell, OPM Quietly Swapped Out Privacy Assessment for Governmentwide Email System Central to Ongoing Litigation, FedScoop (March 3, 2025), https://fedscoop.com/opm-email-privacy-assessment-swap-ongoing-litigation/. 90 FR 17218. 5 See 89 FR 25001 (Comment 3195).6 E.O. 13957, sec. 5(c)(i).7 2\npolicies or projects. In fact, robust civil service protections have empowered me\u2014and, collectively, my coworkers and other career employees\u2014to occasionally share policy recommendations or serious concerns with agency leadership, which sometimes results in our leadership changing course. This is a perfectly normal and healthy process, as career civil servants are supposed to provide candid deliberative advice to the politically appointed leaders who ultimately make the decisions. As OPM continues to recognize, candid internal feedback 8from career policy staff helps to ensure that regulatory changes and other policy initiatives are maximally effective, sustainable, and legally defensible. At the same time, I and other career federal employees certainly understand that we are not the decisionmakers. Elections in a democracy have consequences, and it is entirely appropriate for agencies to pursue the policy preferences of the elected President who appoints its leaders. This is widely understood by all federal employees, who typically go above and beyond Hatch Act requirements to refrain from appearing politically biased whether we\u2019re on or off the clock. Speaking personally, I have often worked to delay, withdraw, rescind, and/or replace rules that I helped a previous administration to promulgate. Occasionally, I have drafted preamble language rebutting the very same language that I personally authored years before in an earlier rulemaking. I have also proactively \u201cpitched\u201d policy ideas to agency leadership in every Presidential administration, including in this administration. In fact, I and my coworkers have already brainstormed numerous ideas for regulatory relief consistent with the deregulatory aims of Executive Orders 14192 and 14219. 9 Given this experience, I am incredulous at OPM\u2019s assertion that policy resistance is \u201ca widespread phenomenon.\u201d This assertion is a reversal from OPM\u2019s findings last year, and it 1011flies in the face of my personal experience. Sensationalist claims about a widespread \u201cdeep state\u201d or \u201cresistance\u201d within the federal civil service simply do not reflect reality. For example, if there truly was widespread \u201cpolicy resistance\u201d against the Trump administration among the 50,000 employees who might be reclassified into Schedule Policy/Career, one would expect ubiquitous leaks about agency rulemakings and other sensitive policy initiatives to news outlets and adverse stakeholders. Here, OPM cites to just one example of a career employee ever leaking a policy document\u2014a draft Presidential executive order promoting classical and traditional architectural styles in the design of federal buildings. This one example, involving a seemingly trivial policy 12issue, does not establish that policy resistance is a \u201cwidespread\u201d phenomenon. 13 See 90 FR 17208 (\u201cCareer staff critiques, especially those coming from a political perspective that 8differs from political appointees, ultimately strengthens policymaking and produces better agency decisions.\u201d).  See 90 FR 9065 (Executive Order 14192); 90 FR 10583 (Executive Order 14219). 9 90 FR 17194.10 89 FR 25000 (\u201cOPM does not agree that employing civil servants \u2026 thwarts the agenda of any 11President, and [such assertions] lack any well-founded support.\u201d). 90 FR 17193 n. 151.12 To be clear, I do not condone the actions of that apparently disgruntled architect.13 3\nThe truth is that, like me, the overwhelming majority of career staff respect the integrity of the policymaking process and the importance of deferring to our Presidentially-appointed leaders. OPM\u2019s citation to unscientific poll results and a handful of clickbait articles do not make a persuasive case to the contrary. In sum, Schedule Policy/Career appears to be a solution in search of a problem. I am not opposed to holding bad actors accountable, but I have never witnessed or heard about insubordination or \u201cpolicy resistance\u201d at my agency of the kind imagined in the NPRM. So, as a threshold matter, I disagree that there is a problem serious enough to justify stripping civil service protections from me and 50,000 other federal employees. Weak Protections and Hollow Assurances Section 6 of amended Executive Order 13957 provides that \u201c[e]mployees in or applicants for Schedule Policy/Career positions are not required to personally or politically support the current President or the policies of the current administration,\u201d and separately instructs agencies to \u201cestablish rules to prohibit the same personnel practices prohibited by [5 U.S.C. 2302(b)] with respect to any employee or applicant for employment in Schedule Policy/Career of the excepted service.\u201d Additionally, amended Executive Order 13957 deviates from the original Executive 14Order 13957 by designating the new schedule as \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d rather than \u201cSchedule F\u201d\u2014ostensibly to rebut \u201cmisinformation\u201d that the administration will use the new schedule as \u201ca means of converting career positions to political positions.\u201d 15These protections are better than nothing, but they seem functionally unenforceable. As OPM noted last year: Once hirings and firings are at-will \u2026 [an] employee might not have an entitlement to written notice of the reasons for [an] adverse action, an opportunity to respond, or a written decision. Nor would the decision generally be appealable. It would thus be, at a minimum, difficult for employees to protect themselves from actions based on political beliefs or party allegiance because no cause (or evidence) would be required prior to such an action. Under Schedule F, because such an employee would be at-will, the employer would need to give little or no reason prior to a termination. In short, Schedule F leaves innumerable ways for politics to factor into these traditionally merit-based decisions in a manner that would be difficult to detect or remedy. 16Even in its new NPRM, OPM acknowledges the risk that \u201csome [agency] officials\u201d may \u201ctreat Schedule Policy/Career positions as noncareer positions\u201d and fire employees for perceived  E.O. 13957, sec. 6.14 90 FR 17200.15 89 FR 24994 (citations omitted).16 4\npolitical disloyalty. In response, OPM replies that it will \u201cbe heavily involved in the 17implementation of Schedule Policy/Career\u201d and \u201cif necessary \u2026 can recommend additional measures to prevent abuses.\u201d Respectfully, these vague assurances are not good enough. OPM 18is the federal agency with the duty to implement amended Executive Order 13957 and should not wait for predictable harms to materialize before merely \u201crecommend[ing]\u201d solutions. Indeed, section 6(a) of amended Executive Order 13957 instructs that \u201cagencies\u201d\u2014including OPM\u2014\u201cshall establish rules to prohibit [certain] personnel practices\u201d against Schedule Policy/Career employees, but OPM\u2019s NPRM fails to include any language about prohibited personnel 19practices in the proposed reg text for 5 CFR 213.3501. At minimum, OPM should fix that 20oversight in its final rule. Of course, the bigger problem is that nothing in OPM\u2019s NPRM or in the express text of amended Executive Order 13957 will protect Schedule Policy/Career employees from mass firings. As OPM notes, \u201cplacing \u2026 employees into Schedule Policy/Career makes them functionally at-will.\u201d Thus, as long as agencies do not discriminate when they fire individual employees, 21agency heads will be newly empowered to quickly fire large groups of federal employees for no reason at all\u2014as many as 50,000 across the federal government, according to OPM's estimate in the NPRM. Contemplating the protections afforded to Schedule Policy/Career employees, one 22is reminded of Joseph Stalin\u2019s infamous distinction between tragedies and statistics. In a tacit acknowledgement of concerns that Schedule Policy/Career could be used for mass firings, OPM assures that \u201cemployees who faithfully perform their jobs to the best of their ability have little to fear from Schedule Policy/Career \u2026 [as] agencies have strong incentives not to dismiss employees who are competently performing their assigned duties.\u201d Of particular 23relevance to me, OPM aptly notes that \u201cdrafting regulations and guidance \u2026 are complex tasks that require considerable experience with the subject matter and technical procedures\u201d which \u201c[f]ew newly hired employees\u2014career or noncareer\u2014can do \u2026 effectively,\u201d concluding that \u201ca President who wants agencies to implement his policies has strong incentives not to dismiss experienced regulation writers who are performing timely and quality work, no matter their personal political affiliation.\u201d Relatedly, OPM asserts that \u201cthe President and his appointees 24have additional incentivizes to maintain a career workforce that contains a diversity of views and opinions \u2026 [as] frank and fearless advice to agency leadership \u2026 helps agencies make better decisions, which the President and agency leaders value.\u201d 25 90 FR 17209. 17 Id.18 E.O. 13957, sec. 6(a) (emphasis added).19 See 90 FR 17222.20 90 FR 17218.21 90 FR 17220.22 90 FR 17218.23 90 FR 17208.24 90 FR 17208-09.25 5\nI wholeheartedly agree with OPM\u2019s statements quoted in the paragraph above, but they ring hollow in light of other actions and statements from the Trump administration exhibiting extreme hostility towards federal employees, including from President Trump. For example, in 26describing his regulatory freeze order issued on January 20, 2025, President Trump deviated from prepared remarks to quip that \u201cMost of those bureaucrats are being fired, they\u2019re gone. Should be all of them, but some sneak through, but we have to live with a couple I guess.\u201d  27In this context, in the absence of specific safeguards to prevent us from being fired for arbitrary reasons, OPM\u2019s assurances to career staff in the NPRM feels like gaslighting from the villain in a predictable horror film. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to have you for dinner! Would you mind stepping down into that soundproof basement?\u201d Conclusion While civil service protections are important for all federal employees, they are particularly important for career policy staff, who perform important work for considerably less pay than what they could earn in the private sector. Candor is key to our jobs, and civil service 28protections are key to our candor. Unfortunately, amended Executive Order 13957 and new Schedule Policy/Career will strip civil service protections from thousands of federal employees who are already weary and demoralized\u2014an extremely misguided policy move. Among other harms, the new Schedule Policy/Career will: \u2022jeopardize the careers and livelihoods of thousands of federal employees;  \u2022deter career staff from providing candid deliberative advice for fear of perceived \u201cresistance;\u201d and \u2022 damage government efforts to recruit, hire, and retain talent, thereby reducing the speed and effectiveness of the federal government.  See Executive Order 14210 of February 11, 2025, 90 FR 9669 (instructing agencies to \u201cpromptly 26undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force\u201d); see also, e.g., Molly Redden and Andy Kroll, \u201cPut Them in Trauma\u201d: Inside a Key MAGA Leader\u2019 s Plans for a New Trump Agenda, ProPublica (Oct. 24, 2024), https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-america-maga; Taylor Giorno, \u2018We Are Terrified\u2019: Musk Puts USAID Through \u2018Wood Chipper,\u2019 The Hill (Feb. 3, 2025), https://www.thehill.com/policy/technology/5122676-usaid-shutdown-elon-musk-doge/.

For example, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \u201cFederal workers with a professional 28degree or doctorate\u2014about 10 percent of the federal workforce\u2014earn about 29 percent less, on average, than their private-sector counterparts.\u201d Congressional Budget Office, \u201cComparing the Compensation of Federal and Private-Sector Employees in 2022,\u201d (April 2024) at 1, https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60235. 6\nAdditional safeguards\u2014such as a language prohibiting the arbitrary firing or mass firing of Schedule Policy/Career employees\u2014could mitigate some of these harms, but this administration\u2019s damage to the federal workforce has already been immense. I don\u2019t fault other federal employees who have decided to move on, but I plan to stick around as long as I can, as I continue to believe in the mission of my agency and in the importance of my job to that mission.  Going forward, I hope to work in partnership with my agency\u2019s new leadership, who I do not hold at fault for the actions of others in this administration. I had positive personal relationships with political appointees from the first Trump administration, and I hope that a successful collaboration this time around can serve as a positive example for the rest of the federal government. At the same time, consistent with OPM\u2019s recommendation, I will continue to provide \u201cfrank and fearless advice to agency leadership\u201d when I see critical mistakes. This 29comment is submitted in that spirit. Thank you for your consideration.\n 90 FR 17209.29 7\n\n\n",

    "comment": "As a dedicated scientist and small business owner committed to the principles of evidence-based research and the mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I am deeply concerned about the proposed rule titled \"Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" (FR Document: 2025-06904). While enhancing accountability within the civil service is a commendable goal, certain aspects of this proposal could inadvertently compromise the nonpartisan foundation essential to scientific endeavors and public trust.The proposal suggests reclassifying policy-influencing positions into a new \"Schedule Policy/Career\" category, rendering them at-will roles exempt from standard adverse action procedures and appeals. Although these positions are described as remaining career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis, the at-will nature inherently introduces a vulnerability to political influence. This is particularly concerning for scientific agencies like the NIH, where policy decisions must be grounded in rigorous, unbiased research rather than shifting political agendas.The ability to remove employees without the usual procedural safeguards could deter scientists from pursuing innovative or controversial research topics, fearing repercussions tied to political sensitivities rather than scientific merit.

    "original_comment": "As a dedicated scientist and small business owner committed to the principles of evidence-based research and the mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I am deeply concerned about the proposed rule titled \"Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" (FR Document: 2025-06904). While enhancing accountability within the civil service is a commendable goal, certain aspects of this proposal could inadvertently compromise the nonpartisan foundation essential to scientific endeavors and public trust.The proposal suggests reclassifying policy-influencing positions into a new \"Schedule Policy/Career\" category, rendering them at-will roles exempt from standard adverse action procedures and appeals. Although these positions are described as remaining career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis, the at-will nature inherently introduces a vulnerability to political influence. This is particularly concerning for scientific agencies like the NIH, where policy decisions must be grounded in rigorous, unbiased research rather than shifting political agendas.The ability to remove employees without the usual procedural safeguards could deter scientists from pursuing innovative or controversial research topics, fearing repercussions tied to political sensitivities rather than scientific merit. Such an environment risks stifling scientific progress and undermines the credibility of institutions that rely on objective analysis to inform public health policies.To preserve the integrity of scientific research and maintain public confidence in our institutions, I urge a reconsideration of the provisions that allow for at-will employment in policy-influencing positions.

That law was passed to stop the old \u201cspoils system,\u201d where jobs were handed out as political favors, and instead establish a system based on merit. Schedule F would do the opposite\u2014it would allow large numbers of career civil servants, especially those involved in policy, to be reclassified and fired without cause. That opens the door wide to political interference and hiring based on loyalty rather than qualifications or expertise.It also violates the due process rights federal workers currently have. Under current law (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513), career employees are supposed to be protected from unjust termination\u2014they deserve fair procedures and a valid reason before being removed. Schedule F throws those protections out the window, weakening both job security and the ability of employees to offer honest, expert advice\u2014even when it\u2019s not politically convenient.There\u2019s also the issue of OPM\u2019s responsibility. The Office of Personnel Management is legally required (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq.) to uphold the merit system principles.

    "comment": "I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s proposed rule (Docket OPM-2025-0004; RIN 3206-AO80) to create a new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d excepted-service category for policy-influencing positions. I strongly oppose the retroactive application of this rule to current incumbents and instead urge OPM to limit any reclassification to positions as they become vacant and to new hires going forward.Career employees have accumulated a property interest in their civil-service status, including pre-removal notice, hearing rights, and MSPB appeals under Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5, U.S. Code. Stripping these protections en masse violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that no person shall be deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due process of law,\u201d and the Supreme Court has recognized that significant employment-related entitlements constitute such property interests. Retaining protections for incumbents while applying Schedule Policy/Career only prospectively would honor those settled expectations without undermining accountability goals.Congress narrowly authorized exceptions to civil-service protections for \u201cpositions determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\u201d\u2014i.e., political appointees\u2014not career incumbents. Section 7511(b)(2) of Title 5 confirms that exclusions from Chapter 75 attach to the position\u2019s nature, not to who occupies it. OPM\u2019s attempt to remove protections from existing incumbents therefore exceeds its regulatory authority under the Civil Service Reform Act.The Civil Service Reform Act requires that any exception to competitive-service requirements be \u201cnecessary\u201d and warranted by \u201cconditions of good administration\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3302). Retroactively sweeping in current employees en masse cannot satisfy that strict standard, as it neither targets proven instances of serious misconduct nor ensures rigorous, case-by-case determinations by individual agency heads.Under the APA, rescinding or revising existing regulations requires the same notice-and-comment procedures used to promulgate them (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553). Yet the proposed rule attempts to render inoperative the Biden-era regulations via a brief NPRM rather than full, reasoned analysis of thousands of comments and empirical data. This approach risks arbitrary and capricious decision-making prohibited by APA \u00a7 706.I respectfully oppose the entire concept of creating a Schedule Policy/Career excepted-service category, the proposed rule itself, and the accompanying Executive Order. Establishing an at-will layer over career positions politicizes roles that Congress intended to remain nonpartisan, undermines merit-system principles, and eliminates foundational due-process safeguards for thousands of federal employees.For these reasons, I urge OPM to withdraw the retroactive reclassification component and the broader Schedule Policy/Career initiative. Civil-service protections should remain intact for current incumbents, with any new accountability measures applied only prospectively to vacated positions and new hires. ",

    "comment": "To Whom It May Concern:I strongly oppose the proposed rule that would establish a new Schedule Policy/Career employment category. This rule raises serious legal concerns, including direct conflict with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and well-established constitutional due process protections for federal employees.1. Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301\u20132302)The CSRA enshrines the merit system principles as the cornerstone of federal employment. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(2) states that \"all employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management\u2026 with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights.\"Furthermore, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 mandates that adverse actions, including removals and suspensions, be carried out only \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\" and requires advance notice, representation, and an opportunity to respond. The proposed Schedule Policy/Career classification unlawfully circumvents these statutory protections by permitting at-will removal without these required procedures.2. Undermining Constitutional Due Process RightsThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), that public employees with a property interest in their continued employment are entitled to due process before termination. By designating career civil servants as at-will employees and removing their appeal rights, the rule violates this constitutional guarantee.Even policy-influencing roles do not lose their entitlement to basic procedural protections when filled through competitive, nonpolitical appointments. Attempting to redefine these roles to strip away due process is a de facto repeal of civil service rights without Congressional authorization.3. Exceeds OPM\u2019s Statutory AuthorityThe proposed rule attempts to unilaterally reclassify large swaths of the workforce and redefine fundamental aspects of federal employment. This oversteps the regulatory authority granted to the Office of Personnel Management under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103, which does not permit wholesale reclassification of employees to evade the merit-based protections mandated by Congress.Courts have been skeptical of agencies attempting to bypass clear statutory protections through rulemaking. As noted in Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014), \"an agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.\"4. Risk of Politicization and RetaliationThe proposed rule\u2019s stated justification includes removing employees who \u201cundermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\u201d This vague and subjective standard, when combined with at-will status, invites abuse and may be used to purge qualified employees for ideological reasons, not performance\u2014a direct violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(10), which prohibits discrimination based on political affiliation.Conclusion:The proposed rule is not only bad policy but also likely unlawful. It threatens to erode the apolitical nature of the civil service, bypasses core legal protections enshrined in the CSRA and the Constitution, and grants the Executive Branch undue power over career personnel.I urge OPM to withdraw this proposal in its entirety.",

    "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule (OPM-2025-0004-0001) that would reintroduce a Schedule F-type classification in the federal workforce. This policy is misguided, legally questionable, and threatens the nonpartisan integrity of the civil service.First, the proposal undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511), which limits the exception of civil service protections to a narrow category of positions that are \u201cconfidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating.\u201d The proposed rule goes far beyond this intent by opening the door to the mass reclassification of career civil servants without sufficient statutory authority.Second, this proposal raises serious constitutional concerns. Federal employees possess a property interest in their continued employment, and reclassifying positions to at-will status without individualized due process may violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. As highlighted in Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41 (2012), federal employees are entitled to meaningful procedural protections and access to redress. Schedule F undermines those principles.Third, this rule would weaken merit system principles enshrined in federal law, including the requirement that hiring and firing decisions be made based on competence and performance, not political loyalty. The nonpartisan, apolitical character of the civil service is a cornerstone of American democracy and public trust.Reinstating Schedule F would politicize career appointments, damage morale, erode institutional expertise, and violate long-standing legal frameworks designed to ensure government accountability and professionalism.I urge OPM to withdraw this proposal in its entirety",

The US, over decades and centuries, has built a current structure that generally works today. Where there are problems, they should be fixed within the system, such as in a manner in accordance with law, such as by increased use of inspectors general.This proposed change will not have the effect of improving the civil service, but rather, will worsen it to favor the current administration's appointees based on their politics, not based on their ability. Unless we assume that one administration will be in power forever, which would not be a sign of a healthy democracy, this proposed change will lead to a less effective civil service that changes from administration to administration and does not build up expertise in service of the country as a whole.",

    "comment": "The Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) proposed rule, OPM-2025-0004-0001, amending 5 CFR Part 731, delegates authority to the OPM Director to make suitability determinations and issue removal directives for federal employees based on post-appointment conduct. This aligns with the reintroduction of Schedule F, rebranded as Schedule Policy/Career in 2025, aiming to reclassify career employees as at-will, stripping them of merit-based protections. As a union-minded scholar, I oppose this rule for its assault on meritocracy, due process, and labor rights, threatening the integrity of the federal civil service.The federal civil service, rooted in the Pendleton Act of 1883, ensures competence and impartiality, shielding employees from political pressures. The proposed rule undermines this by centralizing authority in the OPM Director, mandating agency compliance within five workdays, and aligning with Schedule F\u2019s agenda to politicize the workforce. Schedule F, introduced in 2020 and revoked in 2021, sought to reclassify employees in policy roles as at-will, enabling dismissals without cause. Its 2025 revival, as noted on X, risks replacing career professionals with loyalists, prioritizing politics over expertise.The rule\u2019s vague criteria for \u201cunsuitable\u201d conduct invite abuse, allowing subjective or politicized removals. This contradicts merit-based principles, where decisions should reflect performance, not loyalty. Centralizing authority bypasses agencies\u2019 contextual knowledge, eroding the decentralized structure that ensures fairness. Historically, suitability determinations balanced agency needs with employee rights; this rule tilts toward arbitrary discipline, undermining trust in governance.Due process, a cornerstone of labor law, is gutted by the rule\u2019s five-day compliance mandate, limiting employees\u2019 ability to challenge decisions via the Merit Systems Protection Board or unions. This disproportionately harms unionized workers, whose collective bargaining agreements protect against unjust actions. The rule\u2019s silence on union involvement signals a deliberate sidelining of labor, chilling federal workers\u2019 ability to engage in union activities or exercise First Amendment rights. Such ambiguity risks targeting employees for non-job-related conduct, fostering fear and compliance over independence.The rule operationalizes Schedule F by enabling rapid dismissals of employees deemed misaligned with political priorities. X posts highlight Schedule F as a \u201cdangerous\u201d politicization of public service, undermining agencies\u2019 impartiality. This institutional capture prioritizes partisan agendas, demoralizing workers and reducing expertise in critical areas like public health or environmental protection. The sociological impact\u2014eroding trust in institutions\u2014threatens democratic governance, as politicized agencies may neglect equitable policymaking.Economically, the rule destabilizes federal workers, many supporting families and communities. At-will employment creates uncertainty, disproportionately affecting marginalized groups vulnerable to discriminatory \u201csuitability\u201d interpretations. Socially, a loyalist-driven civil service may prioritize political goals over public needs, exacerbating inequalities in healthcare, poverty, or environmental justice. This betrays the civil service\u2019s oath to the Constitution, not any administration.The rule\u2019s alignment with Schedule F demands its withdrawal. It threatens the meritocratic foundation of the civil service, erodes labor protections, and risks long-term harm to governance. If OPM proceeds, it must: 1) reaffirm merit-based criteria; 2) ensure robust due process with extended timelines and appeals; 3) consult unions to preserve bargaining rights; 4) reject Schedule F\u2019s politicization; and 5) enhance transparency through public hearings.Federal employees deserve a system that upholds fairness, not one that sacrifices them to political expediency. The civil service\u2019s integrity hinges on rejecting this rule and recommitting to merit, impartiality, and labor rights.Citations\u2022White House, Strengthening the Suitability and Fitness of the Federal Workforce, 2025.",

    "comment": "I oppose the proposed regulation OPM-2025-0004, which seeks to reclassify certain federal positions into the new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d category. This change would strip civil service protections from approximately 50,000 federal employees, making them at-will and vulnerable to dismissal without the standard due process. Such a move threatens the merit-based foundation of the federal workforce, opening the door to politicization and undermining the nonpartisan execution of government functions.By removing established safeguards, the regulation risks creating an environment where career professionals can be terminated for political reasons, rather than for legitimate performance issues. This not only jeopardizes the impartiality of federal agencies but also deters qualified individuals from public service due to job insecurity. The proposed rule\u2019s potential to erode institutional knowledge and expertise could lead to inefficiencies and a decline in the quality of public services.Furthermore, the lack of clear criteria for reclassification raises concerns about arbitrary or discriminatory implementation. The regulation\u2019s broad scope and the significant number of positions affected necessitate thorough scrutiny and debate.

This measure would fundamentally erode the merit-based civil service system that has ensured a professional, nonpartisan federal government for over a hundred years.To begin with, Schedule F runs directly counter to the intent of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was designed to dismantle the spoils system by instituting merit-based hiring for federal roles. Reclassifying large numbers of career civil servants\u2014especially those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014would expose them to dismissal without cause. This creates a clear path for politically driven employment decisions, contradicting the core tenet of a politically neutral civil service outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which safeguards employment decisions from partisan influence.Additionally, the broad and ambiguous criteria for placing employees under Schedule F are inconsistent with the due process rights granted under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. That statute requires justified cause and procedural fairness in disciplinary actions involving federal employees. Removing these protections would not only compromise accountability but also stifle open dialogue and expert input within agencies, ultimately weakening the effectiveness of public administration.The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., has a duty to uphold the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F would run contrary to this obligation, introducing undue political interference into a system meant to be impartial and resilient across changing administrations.In summary, Schedule F represents a serious threat to the integrity, independence, and legal foundations of our civil service. I strongly urge both the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory action aimed at bringing this classification back into practice.",

In addition to this damaging the American people, allowing this action will directly endanger both serving bureaucrats and politicians by creating this spoils system that will provide multiple opportunities to engage in purposeful sabotage that will result in disastrous (read: fatal) outcomes.

I would like to oppose the use of political appointees in the federal science funding apparatus as NIH directors, NIH/NSF/DOE program officers, and in similar roles. Grants for scientific research should be administered by scientists as they are best qualified to understand what areas are scientific priorities now and which are likely to become important in the future. While policy goals should inform what funding programs are offered, grantmaking should be separate from policy.

    "comment": "I unequivocally oppose the implementation\u2014or any effort toward the reinstatement\u2014of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification within the federal civil service. Such a proposal represents a fundamental threat to the merit-based framework that has sustained a professional and politically neutral federal workforce for well over a century.At its core, Schedule F subverts the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, legislation specifically designed to dismantle the spoils system and replace it with a system grounded in meritocratic hiring and retention. By authorizing the wholesale reclassification of career civil servants\u2014particularly those engaged in policy formulation or analysis\u2014Schedule F effectively enables arbitrary dismissals untethered from cause or performance. This erodes the apolitical nature of the federal workforce, directly contravening the mandates articulated in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which codify the requirement that federal personnel decisions be guided solely by merit and shielded from partisan interference.Furthermore, the broad and imprecise criteria for Schedule F designation pose significant due process concerns. The protections afforded under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which guarantee cause-based removal and procedural safeguards for career federal employees, are effectively nullified under this classification. Such a shift not only compromises individual rights but also has chilling implications for the internal functioning of federal agencies, discouraging candid professional advice and dissent\u2014both of which are essential to sound policymaking and institutional integrity.The proposed classification also places the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in direct conflict with its statutory obligations under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., which entrust the agency with the stewardship of the merit system principles. Instituting Schedule F would compel OPM to facilitate politically motivated personnel decisions, thereby undermining the very mission it is charged with upholding.In sum, the resurrection of Schedule F represents a profound deviation from the foundational tenets of public administration in the United States. It endangers the independence, competence, and continuity of the civil service and invites a return to politicized governance. I urge the administration and the OPM to reject, without reservation, any regulatory initiative aimed at implementing or reviving this deeply troubling classification.",

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.In conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification. ",

However, this flexibility comes at a serious cost. By reclassifying a significant number of career employees\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014and subjecting them to termination without cause, Schedule F risks replacing expertise with political loyalty. This undermines the principle of an apolitical civil service, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which requires that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence. An administration\u2019s efficiency cannot come at the expense of the constitutional commitment to impartial governance.Advocates also claim that Schedule F would improve accountability by removing underperforming employees more easily. Yet the broad and vague criteria for inclusion in Schedule F contradict the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which require cause and procedural safeguards for removing career federal employees. Stripping these protections weakens\u2014not strengthens\u2014accountability. It could discourage employees from voicing dissenting opinions or providing candid expert advice, ultimately harming the effectiveness of government operations.Additionally, supporters suggest that implementing Schedule F would streamline federal operations by aligning staff more closely with an administration\u2019s goals.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to uphold merit system principles, would be acting against its statutory mission by implementing Schedule F. The result would be undue political pressure on career professionals, threatening the integrity and effectiveness of federal programs across administrations.In summary, while Schedule F may appear to offer greater flexibility and efficiency to the executive branch, its adoption poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law.

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.In conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "During the 19th Century, federal employment was rife with corruption; employees obtained or retained their jobs based not on merit or competence, but on their political affiliation. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) established the current merit-based system in the federal workforce, outlining protections and expectations for a federal employee, while also defining exceptions, such as the historically and realistically miniscule group of political employees. The proposed rule seeks to expand \"political appointee\" to include career employees, stripping them of the protections they have enjoyed since 1978. I am concerned that this rule will inevitably lead to federal employment populated by people retained exclusively for their loyalty or connections to individuals rather than to the mission of supporting all Americans through the government made by the People and for the People. Furthermore, the CSRA does not extend to the President the power to strip career employees of their protections under CSRA, but only political appointees. For the definition of a political appointee, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 9803(c)(2)(A) \"the term 'political appointee' means an employee who holds a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\", 7 U.S.C \u00a7 6992(e)(2)(D) \"the term 'political appointee' means an individual occupying a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\" and 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 725(c) \"The term 'political appointee' means any employee [...] who holds a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\" There is extensive legal precedent, with commentary on the spirit and intent of CSRA from the Supreme Court and Congress itself. Under constitutional and statutory interpretation, ultimately Schedule F is unlawful, if politically convenient. It is my hope that our great Government upholds the rule of law and protects our career civil servants so that federal employment does not become like those seen in adversarial countries, where knowing the right person or currying political favor are the sole keys to success and corruption abounds.",
    "original_comment": "During the 19th Century, federal employment was rife with corruption; employees obtained or retained their jobs based not on merit or competence, but on their political affiliation. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) established the current merit-based system in the federal workforce, outlining protections and expectations for a federal employee, while also defining exceptions, such as the historically and realistically miniscule group of political employees. The proposed rule seeks to expand \"political appointee\" to include career employees, stripping them of the protections they have enjoyed since 1978. I am concerned that this rule will inevitably lead to federal employment populated by people retained exclusively for their loyalty or connections to individuals rather than to the mission of supporting all Americans through the government made by the People and for the People. Furthermore, the CSRA does not extend to the President the power to strip career employees of their protections under CSRA, but only political appointees.

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.In conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "While I support the goal of enhancing performance and accountability in government, I strongly oppose this rule as written. By creating a new Schedule Policy/Career within the excepted service and exempting those employees from the adverse action procedures and appeals protections under 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 and 75, this proposal fundamentally undermines the nonpartisan merit-based civil service established under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA).The CSRA was enacted to ensure that employees are \u201cprotected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes\u201d and to uphold an effective and efficient merit-based civil service (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)). This proposed rule reverses those principles by designating certain career positions as effectively at-will, subject to removal without meaningful procedural safeguards. This would significantly weaken civil service protections that have been in place for decades, diminishing the neutrality and continuity of our federal workforce.Additionally, by shifting a broad class of career positions into an at-will category that can be easily reshaped by each incoming administration, this rule risks triggering cyclical, large-scale turnover every four to eight years. Such turnover would deplete institutional knowledge and discourage long-term public service careers. It would also erode the impartiality that is essential to maintaining public trust in the implementation of laws and policies.Although the proposed rule maintains that these positions will be filled on a nonpartisan basis, the reality is that removing traditional appeal rights and due process protections opens the door to politicized removals and the perception thereof. Even the best-intentioned leaders cannot prevent such perceptions when protections are removed, particularly in politically sensitive policy areas.In conclusion, while the desire to streamline personnel actions is understandable, it must not come at the expense of the core values of a professional, stable, and impartial federal civil service. I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw or substantially revise this proposed rule and instead seek solutions that maintain accountability while preserving the integrity of the merit system as envisioned in the CSRA.",

    "comment": "The proposed Schedule F classification raises significant legal concerns as it violates multiple federal statutes and constitutional protections designed to uphold a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service. Below is the detailed analysis of the legal issues associated with Schedule F:1. Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)The CSRA establishes a merit-based system for federal employment, providing protections against arbitrary dismissal. Schedule F seeks to reclassify certain policy-influencing positions, effectively removing these protections and allowing for at-will termination. Reclassification undermines the CSRA\u2019s intent and structure. Notably, the CSRA permits exceptions for positions of a \u201cconfidential or policy-determining character,\u201d but Schedule F\u2019s broad application exceeds this narrow scope. The Roth v. Brownell decision reinforces that reclassification cannot strip employees of their CSRA protections without due process. 2. Contravention of the Lloyd\u2013La Follette Act of 1912This Act mandates that federal employees cannot be removed without notice and a written explanation. By converting positions to Schedule F, employees lose these procedural safeguards, conflicting with the Act\u2019s requirements. The Roth case further supports that reclassification does not nullify these protections.3. Potential Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth AmendmentFederal employees have a property interest in their continued employment, protected under the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill affirms that due process is required before terminating such employment. Schedule F\u2019s provision for at-will dismissal without prior notice or hearing raises constitutional concerns.4. Breach of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)The APA requires that significant regulatory changes undergo a notice-and-comment period and that agencies provide a reasoned explanation for such changes. The implementation of Schedule F lacks sufficient justification and fails to adhere to APA procedures.5. Undermining the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883The Pendleton Act established the principle of merit-based hiring and protection from political influence. Schedule F\u2019s reclassification could reintroduce a patronage system, allowing for the dismissal of employees based on political considerations, contrary to the Act\u2019s objectives.6. Erosion of Whistleblower ProtectionsWhistleblower statutes protect federal employees who report misconduct. By removing civil service protections through Schedule F, employees may be deterred from reporting wrongdoing due to fear of retaliation, thereby weakening these legal safeguards.7. Application of the Major Questions DoctrineThe Major Questions Doctrine holds that significant policy changes require clear congressional authorization. Given the substantial impact of Schedule F on federal employment, its implementation without explicit legislative approval is considered unlawful under this doctrine.ConclusionThe proposed Schedule F classification poses several legal challenges by violating established federal laws and constitutional protections.

It\u2019s beautifully inefficient, gloriously shortsighted, and so unburdened by historical memory it could win a gold medal in the Amnesia Olympics.Let\u2019s take a quick tour of the world this rule creates.Imagine waking up and learning your child\u2019s science teacher has been replaced by Dave, who once read a cereal box that mentioned climate.

While accountability is an important goal, this rule risks politicizing the civil service and weakening the foundations of impartial governance that have served our democracy for over a century.1. Threat to Civil Service Neutrality:The rule creates ambiguity around what constitutes a \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d position, and opens the door to discretionary and potentially politically motivated removals. This fundamentally undermines the principle of a nonpartisan civil service. Career federal employees must be able to offer honest, evidence-based guidance to leadership\u2014regardless of political climate\u2014without fear of reprisal.2. Chilling Effect on Public Servants:The prospect of being removed for subjective or ideologically driven reasons may deter federal employees from providing critical but politically inconvenient information. This chilling effect degrades policy-making and weakens government oversight functions.3. Risk to Institutional Knowledge and Continuity:Federal employees in policy-advisory roles often possess years\u2014sometimes decades\u2014of institutional knowledge. Sweeping removals in these roles threaten the long-term effectiveness of agencies, especially in complex fields like national security, public health, and regulatory enforcement.4. Erosion of Public Trust:The public depends on a professional and apolitical federal workforce. Perceptions of increased political interference in the civil service will diminish public confidence in government decisions, enforcement actions, and policy execution.5. Disincentive for Talent Recruitment and Retention:This rule may deter talented individuals from pursuing public service, knowing their careers could hinge not on performance or ethics, but on political alignment. That is antithetical to the merit-based ideals OPM is charged with upholding.In summary, while efforts to improve government performance are commendable, this rule appears to prioritize political loyalty over professional excellence and nonpartisan service. I urge OPM to withdraw or substantially revise this rule to ensure it aligns with the foundational values of merit, neutrality, and long-term institutional resilience.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.In conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

    "comment": "I have several concern regarding the rule for the functioning of Science in the US as follows:1. Potential for Political Interference: If scientific positions are classified as \"policy-influencing,\" scientists could be more vulnerable to removal for disagreeing with or challenging political agendas. This could lead to scientists tailoring their findings or recommendations to align with the administration's views, rather than presenting objective, evidence-based conclusions.2. Decreased Scientific Integrity: The fear of reprisal could discourage scientists from conducting or publishing research that contradicts the prevailing political narrative. This could undermine scientific integrity and lead to the suppression or manipulation of scientific information.3. Loss of Expertise and Institutional Knowledge: Frequent turnover in scientific positions due to at-will employment could result in a loss of expertise and institutional knowledge within government agencies. This could hinder long-term research projects, data collection, and the development of effective science-based policies.4. Reduced Scientific Independence: If scientists are more easily removed for their views or findings, their independence could be compromised. This could lead to a decline in public trust in government science and the perception that scientific decisions are being driven by politics rather than evidence.5. Difficulty Attracting and Retaining Top Scientists: The uncertainty and potential for political interference associated with at-will employment could make it more difficult for government agencies to attract and retain top scientists. This could weaken the scientific capacity of the government and its ability to address critical issues.",

    "comment": "A bedrock principle of our republic is a professional and nonpartisan civil service, a system carefully constructed on merit since the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883. The proposed \"Schedule F\" classification poses a significant threat to this enduring foundation. By potentially allowing the reclassification and dismissal without cause of a broad spectrum of career civil servants, particularly those engaged in crucial policy formulation and analysis, this initiative opens a dangerous pathway for political considerations to unduly influence hiring and firing decisions. This directly contravenes the spirit and letter of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which clearly mandates that federal employment decisions must be rooted in merit-based principles, shielded from the vagaries of political influence.Furthermore, the imprecise and expansive criteria for inclusion under \"Schedule F\" raise serious concerns regarding the fundamental due process protections currently afforded to career federal employees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. These established safeguards require just cause and adherence to procedural fairness before the removal of dedicated public servants. To strip potentially thousands of these individuals of such essential protections not only weakens the mechanisms of accountability within our government but also creates a chilling effect on the willingness of experts to offer candid advice and dissenting opinions, ultimately undermining the operational effectiveness of our governmental institutions.The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) also bears a statutory responsibility, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., to vigorously support and uphold the principles of the merit system. The implementation of \"Schedule F\" stands in direct contradiction to this vital statutory mission. It would subject career professionals to undue political pressures, thereby compromising the integrity and the essential continuity of federal programs that serve the American people across different administrations.In conclusion, the \"Schedule F\" proposal represents a grave danger to the fundamental tenets of sound governance, the cherished independence of our civil service, and the overarching rule of law. It is my considered and firm conviction that the current administration and the Office of Personnel Management must resolutely reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this ill-conceived and potentially damaging classification.",

It would take away a merit based system that ensures a federal government full of workers that are nonpartisan and held to high standards. The creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. It allows partisan politics to hold sway over our federal government workforce instead of a merit based since it allows a large number of federal employees, many who have served our government for their entire career, to be fired without cause. Politically motivated terminations and hiring will be on the table if this is allowed which is incredibly detrimental to the functioning of our federal government particularly in regards to those who make and analyze policy. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F directly contradicts this. It allows political pressure to be a deciding factor in how one performs their job instead of one\u2019s aptitude, causing employees to be ineffectual due to their fear of being terminated without cause. (The cause being they do not align politically with the decision makers.)The vague criteria for inclusion in schedule F violates due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 751 which can only lead to a more ineffective government as it encourages a lack of accountability, transparency, and discourages alternative points of view which are needed for a successful federal government in a democracy.To sum it up, the Schedule F proposal is antithetical to maintaining a well functioning, non partisan, federal government where employees can do their jobs without fear of reprisal due to differences in thought or belief. Please reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive Schedule F, I implore you. ",

    "comment": "This partisan rule would result in a regrettable return to the spoils system and decimate the institutional knowledge critical to maintaining a functioning government that serves the American people.I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.In conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

Career civil servants with institutional knowledge are essential for maintaining operations during transitions of power.2.Creating Workforce Instability and Loss of Expertise: At-will employment for \"policy-influencing\" positions would lead to increased turnover and loss of specialized knowledge. This destabilization would make it difficult to recruit and retain talented professionals essential to government operations.3.Undermining Due Process and Employee Morale: Eliminating MSPB appeal rights removes crucial protections that ensure merit-based employment decisions. This change would significantly damage morale across agencies, as employees face uncertainty about reclassification of their positions.4.Expanding Political Influence Through Vague Criteria: The term \"policy-influencing\" is inherently broad and subject to interpretation. Without clear criteria, this designation could be applied to numerous career positions, extending far beyond roles that genuinely involve policy formulation, leading to increased politicization of government operations.5.Inhibiting Expert Advice and Professional Judgment: Federal employees must provide candid professional advice without fear of summary dismissal. This rule would discourage career employees from offering their best professional judgment when it might contradict political preferences, undermining evidence-based decision-making across government.While I recognize the importance of addressing performance management challenges in the federal workforce, this approach creates far more problems than it solves. I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule and instead work with stakeholders to develop alternative approaches that strengthen accountability while preserving the integrity of the merit-based civil service system.",

This rule risks politicizing the federal workforce by allowing the reclassification of career civil servants into a category of employees who can be hired and fired without the usual merit-based protections.At the heart of my concern is the threat this proposal poses to the independence and integrity of the civil service. If enacted, the rule would enable the executive branch to subject career officials to implicit or explicit loyalty tests, requiring alignment with the political priorities of the President rather than adherence to law, science, and the public interest.Key Issues:Encouraging Loyalty over Expertise:The reclassification of positions removes critical due process protections, effectively allowing political appointees to dismiss civil servants based on perceived loyalty rather than competence or adherence to ethical obligations. This creates a chilling effect where employees may feel pressured to conform politically to avoid retaliation or termination.Undermining Nonpartisan Governance:Civil servants are obligated to serve the public and uphold the Constitution\u2014not to serve the personal or political interests of any one administration. Weakening their independence by tying job security to political loyalty erodes the public\u2019s trust in an impartial government.Historical Precedent and Rejection:A similar framework was widely criticized and ultimately revoked in the past because it posed such an obvious risk to democratic norms and accountable governance. Reintroducing this idea\u2014especially after its rejection\u2014threatens to normalize a dangerous precedent.Stability and Continuity in Government:Our nation depends on a stable, professional civil service that can endure across administrations. Allowing widespread reclassification risks turning expert agencies into echo chambers, reducing their ability to provide honest, evidence-based policy guidance.Conclusion:This proposed rule is not about reform\u2014it is about control. We must not allow a return to a system where public servants are forced to pass political loyalty tests to keep their jobs. I urge OPM to preserve the integrity of the civil service by withdrawing this proposal and upholding the principles of impartial, merit-based government employment.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.",

Civil servants are there to serve the country, not a particular president, and we need the longevity and institutional knowledge that the federal employees develop to be kept around across presidents. This rule makes it far too easy for a president to fire these employees without cause, removing the important longevity and bipartisan nature of their roles. It opens the door to purging experts, silencing dissenters, and politicizing the civil service, which is precisely the wrong way to retain the long-term initiatives that keep our country running such as public health and disaster response. We need career officials who follow facts, not party lines. Please, do not implement this rule!",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.As a government supervisor, there are multiple tools and processes at my disposal to reprimand or remove an employee. Further, there are similar tools and process to ensure that all individuals get a fair shake. Getting rid of the something that forces a merit-based system seems counter intuitive to the current administrations policies.The creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.In conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

Central to my concern is such that this measure poses a major threat to the institutional independence of federal agencies and the long-standing tradition of a nonpartisan, expert-driven civil service. Federal agencies are delegated this power to remain unbiased in regards to political pressures and, should this proposed rule pass, Schedule F would erode the separation between elected leadership and the professional workforce that carries out the law. This is not merely an administrative change, but rather a fundamental shift in how government power is distributed and exercised, and should be strongly considered when voting on this rule. The role agencies play is that of an informed and responsible institution that should be distanced from partisan influence and focused directly on the security and wellbeing of both democracy and the government's constituents. Though the NPRM cites that lack of administrative power over federal agencies undermines democracy by \"[enabling] government power to be wielded without accountability to the voters or their elected representatives\", this is a misleading interpretation of the role agencies play in our government. As discussed in Administrative Procedures as Instruments of Political Control, when any administration gains the ability to easily intervene and control the decisions of bureaucratic agencies, it opens the door for these agencies to be used for political gain (McCubbins et al.). This threatens the safeguards in place to protect against corruption and manipulation, compromising the independence of the bureaucracy and its ability to act impartially in the public interest. Passing this rule would set a precedent that would both diminish the credibility of our federal agencies and threaten our democracy as a whole.",

Instead this proposal leaves \"policy-making positions\" open to interpretation while also sweeping all managers in as policy-making positions.

This proposed rule is fundamentally flawed, as it does not seek to solve performance concerns.Considering the alternatives that the authors could have proposed to address performance and accountability concerns, the only logical conclusion is that this proposed rule is politically based and meant to undermine civil service protections to control the actions of federal employees. Considering that all federal employees are charged with upholding the constitution and abiding by laws, why is this proposal necessary?Civil service protections exist to ensure that federal staff are non-partisan. Federal staff need civil service protections to ensure that they protect the constitution and laws at all costs. Eroding civil service protections means that federal employees will have no recourse if or when they are asked to complete illegal tasks.If this proposed rule is adopted as is it will be very clear to the US and the world that the US government is no longer to be trusted, as all of its staff's livelihoods are at the whim of a despot.",

    "comment": "I strongly oppose the implementation of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.In conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement this dangerous classification.Also, please remember, these are American lives and livelihoods that will be affected by this change. Federal workers love their country and the American people who they serve. They should ultimately be accountable to the American people and should follow the laws of the land, not the preferences of one administration or the other.

    "comment": "This order wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees and at-will workers to career staff; deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired; and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.  It is a dangerous step backward to a political spoils system that Congress expressly rejected 142 years ago. Staff of the federal agencies secure the nation, safeguard the public health, promote economic growth and protect consumers from fraud. Their jobs require training and expertise in their chosen field so as to provide the best possible service to all Americans, not passing a political loyalty test.The Office of Personnel Management established additional safeguards for employees in the event of an executive action like this and those regulations became final in May 2024.  This order has no right to circumvent these regulations.Civil servants should be focused on their tasks to deliver for the American people and must be protected from arbitrary replacement based on political ideologies, and the corruption that can result from reclassifying them in the same category as political appointees.  The expertise of career civil servants has value and the regulations protecting their employment must not be stripped away to make places for political loyalists who may lack the same expertise and experience of the staff they replace.  The partisan interference that this order advocates in the staffing of federal agencies must be blocked in order to not impair the functioning of these agencies.   Career Federal employees deserve better protection against this treatment and stability in their careers, and they have it in OPM regulations that this order ignores.  The American people deserve agencies staffed with experienced workers that work for their benefit.  This order would strip away their job security and open up the likelihood of being replaced by less qualified staff in order to assert politcal control over the functioning of these agencies.Opposing this is foundational to how we can ensure that the government delivers for people.  That is what a democracy is about.\n\n\n\n--- ATTACHMENTS ---\n\n[ATTACHMENT: 2024-06815]\n24982 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n1See Lindahl v.

In this final rule, OPM adopts many of the provisions from the proposed rule with some modifications and clarifications based on comments received from the public. The final regulations will better align OPM regulations with relevant statutory text, congressional intent, legislative history, legal precedent, and OPM\u2019s longstanding practice. \nDATES : Effective May 9, 2024. \nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT : \nTimothy Curry by email at employeeaccountability@opm.gov or by \nphone at (202) 606\u20132930. \nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : \nTable of Contents \nI.

Executive Summary \nThe Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) is issuing final regulations \ngoverning competitive service and competitive status, employment in the excepted service, and adverse actions. The final rule also makes conforming changes to the regulations governing performance-based actions and awards. \nThis rule clarifies and reinforces \nlongstanding civil service protections and merit system principles, reflected in the passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. The Act ended the patronage, or \u2018\u2018spoils,\u2019\u2019 system for Federal employment and initiated the competitive civil service. For the past 140 years, Congress has enacted statutes and agencies have promulgated rules that govern the civil service, beginning with laws that limited political influence in employment decisions and growing over the years to establish comprehensive laws regulating many areas of Federal employment. These changes were designed to further good government. Subsequent statutes, including, among others, the Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912, the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944, as amended, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), and the Civil Service Due Process Amendments Act of 1990, extended and updated these civil service provisions. \nWhereas the Pendleton Act \neliminated the spoils system and introduced a merit-based civil service as a key pillar of our democratic system, the CSRA was the signature, bipartisan reform that has most shaped the system we have today.\n1It created an elaborate \n\u2018\u2018new framework\u2019\u20192of the modern civil \nservice, protected career Federal employees from undue partisan political influence, and extended adverse action rights by statute to a larger cohort of employees, so that the business of government can be carried out efficiently and effectively, in compliance with the law, and in a manner that encourages individuals to \napply to participate in the civil service. \nThe 2.2 million career civil servants \nactive today are the backbone of the Federal workforce. They are dedicated and talented professionals who provide the continuity of expertise and experience necessary for the Federal Government to function optimally across administrations. These employees take an oath to uphold the Constitution and are accountable to agency leaders and managers who, in \nturn, are accountable to the President, Congress, and the American people for their agency\u2019s performance. At the same time, these civil servants must carry out critical tasks requiring that their expertise be applied objectively (performing data analysis, conducting scientific research, implementing existing laws, etc.). \nCongress has dictated a well- \nestablished way in which agencies can control their workforces. If a Federal employee refuses to implement lawful direction from leadership, there are mechanisms for agencies to respond through discipline, up to and including removal, as appropriate, under chapter 75 of title 5, U.S. Code. If a Federal employee\u2019s performance has been determined to be unacceptable, the agency may respond under chapter 75 (on the basis that action is necessary to promote the efficiency of the service) or pursue a performance-based action under chapter 43 of title 5, U.S. Code, at the agency\u2019s discretion. Under the law, however, a mere difference of opinion with leadership does not qualify as misconduct or unacceptable performance or otherwise implicate the efficiency of the service in a manner that would warrant an adverse action. \nCareer civil servants have a level of \ninstitutional experience, subject matter expertise, and technical knowledge that incoming political appointees have found to be useful and may lack themselves. Such civil servants\u2019 ability to offer their objective analyses and educated views when carrying out their duties, without fear of reprisal or loss of employment, contribute to the reasoned consideration of policy options and thus the successful functioning of incoming administrations and our democracy. These rights and abilities must continue to be protected and preserved, as envisioned by Congress when it enacted the CSRA, and expanded and strengthened those protections through subsequent enactments such as the Civil Service Due Process Amendments Act.\n3 \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24983 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n4See 5 U.S.C. 1103(a)(5)(A). \n5See 5 U.S.C. 7504, 7514. \n6See, e.g., 5 CFR part 212. \n7OPM notes that employees appointed pursuant \nto Schedule C have no expectation of accruing such \nrights, considering the longstanding interpretation of 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) and E.O. 10577, Rule VI, Schedule C, as amended. There are a small number of additional, discrete, positions for which the appointing authority similarly precludes the accrual of such rights, by the appointing authority\u2019s own terms. \n8The final rule further discusses the differences \nbetween voluntary and involuntary moves in Section IV(A). \n9As explained further infra, an individual can \nvoluntarily relinquish rights when moving to a position that explicitly results in the loss of, or different, rights. An agency\u2019s failure to inform an employee of the consequences of a voluntary transfer cannot confer appeal rights to an employee in a position which has no appeal rights by statute. This is distinguishable from situations where the individual was coerced or deceived into taking the new position with different rights. See Williams v. MSPB, 892 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 2018). 10See 5 CFR 213.3301, 302.101, 432.102, 451.302, \n752.202, 752.401. \n11The relevant regulatory language currently \nvaries slightly. For instance, 5 CFR part 752 refers to positions \u2018\u2018of a confidential, policy-determining, policy making, or policy-advocating character.\u2019\u2019 But 5 CFR part 213 describes these positions as being \u2018\u2018of a confidential or policy-determining character,\u2019\u2019 5 CFR part 302 uses \u2018\u2018of a confidential, policy- determining, or policy-advocating nature,\u2019\u2019 and 5 CFR part 451 uses \u2018\u2018of a confidential or policy- making character.\u2019\u2019 In this final rule, OPM adopts \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy making, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018confidential or policy- determining\u2019\u2019 as two, interchangeable alternatives to describe these positions. \n12The term \u2018\u2018career employee,\u2019\u2019 as used here, \nrefers to appointees to competitive service permanent or excepted service permanent positions. The terms \u2018\u2018noncareer political appointee\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018political appointee,\u2019\u2019 as used here, refer to individuals appointed by the President or his appointees pursuant to Schedule C (or similar authorities) who serve at the pleasure of the current President or his political appointees and who have no expectation of continued employment beyond the presidential administration in which the appointment occurred. 13OPM\u2019s authorities to issue regulations only \nextend to title 5, U.S. Code. A position may be placed in the excepted service by presidential action, under 5 U.S.C. 3302, by OPM action, under authority delegated by the President pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1104, or by Congress. These proposed regulations apply to any situation where an agency moves positions or people from the competitive service to the excepted service, or between excepted services, whether pursuant to statute, Executive order, or an OPM issuance, to the extent that these provisions are not inconsistent with applicable statutory provisions. For example, to the extent that a position is placed in the excepted service by an act of Congress, an OPM regulation will not supersede a statutory provision to the contrary. However, an OPM regulation may prescribe the procedures by which agencies would be required to move positions unless inconsistent with that statutory provision. Similarly, these regulatory provisions also apply where positions previously governed by title 5 will be governed by another title going forward, unless the statute governing the exception provides otherwise. \n14E.O. 14003, sec. 2. Congress has generally charged the \nOPM Director with executing, \nadministering, and enforcing the laws governing the civil service.\n4In chapter \n75, Congress provided certain Federal employees with specified procedural rights and provided OPM with broad authority to prescribe regulations to carry out the chapter\u2019s purposes.\n5 \nMoreover, OPM regulations govern the movement of positions from the competitive service to the excepted service.\n6Pursuant to its authority, OPM \nissues this rule to clarify and reinforce longstanding civil service protections and merit system principles as codified in the CSRA. OPM amends its regulations in 5 CFR chapter I, \nsubchapter B, as follows: \nFirst, the rule amends 5 CFR part 752 \n(Adverse Actions) to clarify that civil servants in the competitive service or excepted service who qualify as \u2018\u2018employees\u2019\u2019 under 5 U.S.C. 7501, 7511(a)\u2014meaning they have fulfilled their probationary or trial period requirement or durational requirement and are not excluded from the definition of \u2018\u2018employee\u2019\u2019 by 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)\n7\u2014 \nwill retain the rights previously accrued upon an involuntary move\n8from the \ncompetitive service to the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another, or any subsequent involuntary move, unless the employee relinquishes such rights or status by voluntarily encumbering a position that explicitly results in a loss of, or different, rights.\n9The rule also conforms \nthe regulation for non-appealable adverse actions with statutory language in 5 U.S.C. 7501 and Federal Circuit precedent to clarify which employees are covered. The rule amends 5 CFR part 212 (Competitive Service and Competitive Status) to further clarify a competitive service employee\u2019s status in the event the employee and/or their position is moved involuntarily to an excepted service schedule. OPM also updates the regulations to reflect the repeal of 10 U.S.C. 1599e, effective December 31, 2022, and restores a one- year probationary period for covered Department of Defense employees appointed to permanent positions within the competitive service in the Department of Defense on or after December 31, 2022. \nSecond, the rule amends 5 CFR part \n210 (Basic Concepts and Definitions (General)) to interpret the phrases \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018confidential or policy- determining\u2019\u2019\n10in 5 CFR 210.102. These \nterms of art\u2014which would apply throughout OPM\u2019s Civil Service Regulations in 5 CFR chapter I, subchapter B\n11\u2014describe positions of \nthe character generally excepted from chapter 75\u2019s protections. OPM reinforces the longstanding interpretation that, in creating this exception in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2), Congress intended to except noncareer political appointees\n12from civil service \nprotections. \nThird, the rule amends 5 CFR part 302 \nto provide specific procedures that apply when moving individuals or positions from the competitive service to the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another, for the purposes of good administration, to add transparency, and to provide a right of appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board) to the extent any such move is involuntary and characterized as stripping individuals of any previously accrued \ncivil service status and protections. \nOn September 18, 2023, OPM issued \na notice of proposed rulemaking, which was published at 88 FR 63862. After consideration of public comments on the proposed regulatory amendments, OPM has determined that the issuance of these revised regulations is essential to strengthen and protect the foundations of the civil service and its merit system principles.\n13These \nprinciples were critical to the Pendleton Act\u2019s repudiation of the spoils system; essential to continued compliance with the statutory schemes for performance management, as enacted by Congress (and subsequently expanded) to extend procedural entitlements to most career employees following a specified period of service; and essential to the creation of the modern civil service on which this country depends and under which it has thrived for 140 years.\n14The final \nrule is also critical to the Federal Government\u2019s ability to recruit and retain the talent that agencies need to deliver on their complex missions. Individuals considering whether to accept a career civil service position need to know that they will be valued for their knowledge, skills, and abilities; evaluated based on merit; and not only protected from retribution for offering \ntheir candid opinions but encouraged to do so. Policies that cast doubt on these fundamental characteristics of a career civil service job restrict the pool of applicants interested in Federal Government jobs and disadvantage agencies in competing for top talent. \nOPM may set forth policies, \nprocedures, standards, and supplementary guidance for the implementation of this final rule. \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24984 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n15Approximately five of the 4,097 comments \ncould be considered neutral\u2014neither supportive \nnor opposed. \n16The form letters are described below where \nrelevant. \n17See 88 FR 63862, 63881. \n18See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Archives, Milestone Documents, \n\u2018\u2018Pendleton Act (1883),\u2019\u2019 https://www.archives.gov/ milestone-documents/pendleton-act. 19U.S. Merit Sys.

Commenter opposed the rule and did not dispute the factual bases of the Pendleton Act but argued that its limited treatment of removal rights supports a view that modern removal protections can now be eliminated for certain career civil servants.

Digest of Public Comments \nIn response to the proposed rule, \nOPM received 4,097 comments during \nthe 60-day public comment period from a variety of individuals (including current and former civil servants), organizations, and Federal agencies. At the conclusion of the public comment period, OPM reviewed and analyzed the comments. In general, the comments ranged from enthusiastic support of the proposed regulations to categorical rejection. Approximately 67 percent of the overall comments were supportive of the proposed regulatory amendments.\n15Of the approximately 33 \npercent of comments that were opposed, more than 95 percent of those comments consisted of one of four form letters.\n16 \nIn the proposed rule, OPM requested \ncomments on a variety of topics regarding the implementation and impacts of this rulemaking.\n17OPM \nreceived many comments in response and incorporated them in the relevant sections that follow. Such information was useful for better understanding the effect of these final revisions on civil service protections, merit system principles, and the effective and efficient business of government, in compliance with the law. \nIn the next section, we address the \nbackground for these regulatory amendments and related comments. In subsequent sections, we address the specific amendments, provide a regulatory analysis, and list procedural considerations. OPM concludes with the amended regulatory text. \nIII. Background and Related Comments A. The Career Civil Service, Merit \nSystem Principles, and Civil Service Protections \nIt is critical to our government that \ncareer Federal employees be protected from undue partisan influence so that business can be carried out efficiently and effectively, in compliance with the law. \nPresident George Washington based \nmost of his federal appointments on merit. Subsequent presidents, though, deviated from this policy, to varying degrees.\n18\u2018\u2018By the time Andrew Jackson \nwas elected president in 1828,\u2019\u2019 the patronage or \u2018\u2018 \u2018spoils system,\u2019 . . . was in full force.\u2019\u2019 Under this system, Federal employees were generally \nappointed, retained, or removed based on their political affiliations and support for the political party in power rather than their capabilities or competence.\n19A change in \nadministration often triggered the widespread removal of Federal employees to provide jobs for the supporters of the new President, his party, and party leaders.\n20This spoils \nsystem often resulted in party managers \u2018\u2018pass[ing] over educated, qualified candidates and distribut[ing] offices to \u2018hacks\u2019 and ward-heelers who had done their bidding during campaigns and would continue to serve them in government.\u2019\u2019\n21Theodore Roosevelt, \nwho served as a Civil Service Commissioner before becoming the Vice President and then President of the United States, described the spoils system as \u2018\u2018more fruitful of degradation in our political life than any other that could possibly have been invented. The spoilsmonger, the man who peddled patronage, inevitably bred the vote- buyer, the vote-seller, and the man guilty of misfeasance in office.\u2019\u2019\n22 \nGeorge William Curtis, a reformer and proponent of a merit-based civil service, described that, under the spoils system, \u2018\u2018[t]he country seethe[d] with intrigue and corruption. Economy, patriotism, honesty, honor, seem[ed] to have become words of no meaning.\u2019\u2019\n23 \nEthical standards for Federal employees were at a low ebb under this system. \u2018\u2018Not only incompetence, but also graft, corruption, and outright theft were common.\u2019\u2019\n24 \nTo protect career Federal employees \nfrom undue partisan influence, civil service advocates and then Congress sought to establish a Federal nonpartisan career civil service that would be selected based on merit rather than political affiliation.\n25Such a \nworkforce, though initially limited in scope, would reinvigorate government, making it more efficient and competent.\n26This reform movement \ncame to a head in 1881 when President James Garfield was shot by a disappointed office seeker who believed he was entitled to a Federal job based on the work he had done for Garfield and his political party.\n27 \nThe Pendleton Act of 188328ended \nthis patronage system for covered positions and created the competitive civil service. Coverage has grown as a proportion of the Federal workforce over time to cover nearly all career positions.\n29The Pendleton Act required \nagencies to appoint Federal employees covered by the Act based on competency and merit.\n30It also \nestablished the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to help implement and enforce the government\u2019s adherence to merit-based principles.\n31 \nCommenters generally agreed32with \nthis background,33especially the point \nthat the corruption of the spoils era and evolving complexity of government necessitated a nonpartisan career civil service. A professor concurred with OPM\u2019s contention that the growing complexity of issues facing the United States in the late nineteenth century, \u2018\u2018combined with the pathologies engendered by the Jacksonian spoils system (culminating in the assassination of President Garfield) led to the creation of a competitive civil service.\u2019\u2019 Comment 42.\n34Other commenters noted \nthat the Pendleton Act was intended to eliminate the influence of personal loyalty and partisan activity as the key qualifications for career appointees, and replace them with \u2018\u2018fitness, capacity, \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24985 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n35The Pendleton Act does specify that \u2018\u2018no person \nin the public service is . . . under any obligations \nto contribute to any political fund, or to render any political service, and that he will not be removed \nor otherwise prejudiced for refusing to do so.\u2019\u2019 22 Stat. at 404. \n36U.S. Merit Sys.

Rec. 2653\u201354 (1912). \n4058 Stat. 387 (1944). 41Agencies initially were not required to comply \nwith the CSC\u2019s recommendations in adverse action \nappeals, but Congress amended the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act in 1948 to require compliance. See 67 Stat. 581 (1948); see also U.S. Merit Sys. Prots. Bd., supra note 19 at pp. 7\u20138. \n42E.O. No. 10988, 27 FR 551 (Jan. 19, 1962) (\u2018\u2018The \nhead of each agency, in accordance with the provisions of this order and regulations prescribed by the Civil Service Commission, shall extend to all employees in the competitive civil service rights identical in adverse action cases to those provided \npreference eligibles under section 14 of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944, as amended.\u2019\u2019) (emphasis added). \n4392 Stat. 1111 (1978); see. Fausto, 484 U.S. at \n455 (\u2018\u2018The CSRA established a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel action taken against federal employees.\u2019\u2019). \n44Citing Dobrovir, Gebhardt and Devine, \n\u2018\u2018Blueprint for Civil Service Reform,\u2019\u2019 Fund for Constitutional Government (1976). \n45That these concerns have been ongoing can be \nseen in Congress\u2019 enactment of the Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 referenced in note 155, infra. honesty [and] fidelity.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2816; \nsee also Comments 2822, 3029. \nThe contours of the civil service and \nmerit system principles that resulted were borne of extensive debates in which one view clearly prevailed. A former federal official commented that \u2018\u2018Congress decided to target the threats of increased incompetence and patronage in a spoils system, and decided that the benefits of a professionalized civil service outweighed concerns about bureaucratic inertia.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2816. Commenter noted that \u2018\u2018opponents of the Pendleton Act argued [at the time] that civil service protections were \u2018one step in the direction of the establishment of an aristocracy in this country, the establishment of another privileged class.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Id. Commenter concluded that \n\u2018\u2018arguments that the civil service should be responsive to, rather than insulated from, the churn of partisan politics are echoed by contemporary critics of civil service protections. But these arguments against a professional civil service were soundly rejected with the passage of the Pendleton Act and have been proven to have been incorrect over more than a century of experience.\u2019\u2019 Id. \nA legal nonprofit organization \nsimilarly commented that the features of the \u2018\u2018civil service that frustrate its critics\u2014fealty to Congressional programs, dedication to government institutions, consideration of the public interest, and a mission broader than simply serving political appointees\u2014are core components of the system established by an elected Congress almost 150 years ago.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2822. Congress \u2018\u2018has spoken clearly about its vision for the civil service for a century and a half, and consistently rejected a civil service that is merely an extension of a President\u2019s will.\u2019\u2019 Id. \nSeveral commenters noted that the \nPendleton Act was extraordinarily successful in establishing the foundation for the modern civil service. A former federal official explained that the Act had the qualitative benefit of improving targeted employees\u2019 professional backgrounds. Comment 2816. As discussed further in Section III(E), the nonpartisan civil service ensured that the United States government would be capable of combating problems \u2018\u2018unimagined when the Pendleton Act was passed, including auto safety, climate change, and the airworthiness of planes.\u2019\u2019 See Comment 42. \nEven with respect to the enactment of \nthe Pendleton Act, a subsequent President saw the need to address removals more specifically not long afterward.\n35In 1897, President William \nMcKinley addressed removals by \nissuing Executive Order 101, which mandated that \u2018\u2018[n]o removal shall be made from any position subject to competitive examination except for just cause and upon written charges filed with the head of the Department, or other appointing officer, and of which the accused shall have full notice and an opportunity to make defense.\u2019\u2019\n36 \nCongress, far from objecting to this Order, later essentially codified these requirements in the Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912\n37to establish that covered \nFederal employees were to be both hired and removed based on merit. Specifically, section 6 of the Act provided no person in the \u2018\u2018classified civil service\u2019\u2019\n38of the United States can \nbe removed \u2018\u2018except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of said service\u2019\u2019 and for reasons given in writing. The Act also mandated providing notice to the person whose removal is sought and \u2018\u2018of any charges [proffered] against him, and be furnished with a copy thereof, and also be allowed a reasonable time for personally answering the same in writing; and affidavits in support\u2019\u2019 of the removal. \nCongress, over time, has codified, \nrenewed, and expanded protections to civil servants. A former federal official quoted Rep. James Tilghman Lloyd, one of the Lloyd-La Follette Act\u2019s namesakes, as saying the Act sought to \u2018\u2018do away with the discontent and suspicion which now exists among the employees [of the civil service] and [ ] restore that confidence which is necessary to get the best results from the employees.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2816. It would, according to Rep. Lloyd, ensure that civil servants \u2018\u2018being dismissed from service would have the benefit of a written record of charges against them, with reports made to Congress, and the ability to have Congress subject their dismissal to \u2018special inquiry\u2019 if department heads \u2018trump up charges\u2019 to dismiss civil servants.\u2019\u2019\n39Id. \nThereafter, Congress enacted further \nrequirements and reforms. In 1944, Congress passed the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act,\n40which, among other things, granted federally employed \nveterans extensive rights to challenge adverse employment actions, including the right to file an appeal with the CSC and provide the CSC with documentation to support the appeal. Based on the evidence presented, the CSC would issue findings and recommendations regarding the adverse employment action. In short, the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act provided eligible veterans with adverse action protections and access to an appeals process.\n41Then, in 1962, President John \nF. Kennedy issued Executive Order 10988 to extend similar adverse action rights to a broader swath of the civil service, specifically, employees in the competitive service.\n42 \nB. Conduct and Performance Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 \nTo synthesize, expand upon, and \nfurther codify the patchwork of processes that had developed over almost a century, and to protect a broader group of civil servants and govern personnel actions, Congress in 1978 passed the CSRA\n43\u2014the most \ncomprehensive Federal civil service reform since the Pendleton Act. \nOne factor that led to the CSRA, as a \nwhistleblower protection nonprofit organization explained, was that \u2018\u2018whistleblowers at the Senate Watergate hearings\u2019\u2019 showed that the Nixon Administration \u2018\u2018tried to implement the Malek Manual, a secret blueprint to replace the civil service merit system with a political hiring scheme\u2019\u2019 that would have begun \u2018\u2018by purging all Democrats from federal employment.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3340.\n44Those abuses led to \npassage of the CSRA \u2018\u2018to shield the merit system with enforceable rights against similar future abuses.\u2019\u2019 Id.\n45 \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24986 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n46Congress envisioned that: \u2018\u2018OPM would be the \nadministrative arm of Federal personnel \nmanagement, serve as Presidential policy advisor, . . . promulgate regulations, set policy, run research and development programs, implement rules and regulations, and would manage a centralized, innovative Federal personnel program.\u2019\u2019 124 Cong.

A fundamental difference between the two is the duration in which \nemployees must serve. The probationary period is set by law to last 1 year. When the trial period is set by individual agencies, it can last up to 2 years. See 5 CFR 315.801 through 806; see also U.S. Merit \nSys. Prots.

Cases that include claims under certain discrimination statutes are appealable to Federal district courts. See 5 U.S.C. 7703(b)(2). \n645 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2)(A), (B), and (C). The CSRA made significant \norganizational changes to civil service \nmanagement, adjudications, and oversight. It replaced the CSC, dividing its duties among OPM\n46and the MSPB, \nwhich initially encompassed the Office of Special Counsel (OSC).\n47OSC later \nbecame a separate agency to which specific duties were assigned.\n48OPM \ninherited the CSC\u2019s policy, managerial, and administrative duties, including the obligation to establish standards, oversee compliance, and conduct examinations as required or requested.\n49 \nOPM was also obligated to, among other things, advise the President regarding appropriate changes to the civil service rules, administer retirement benefits, adjudicate employees\u2019 entitlement to these benefits, and defend adjudications at the Board.\n50The MSPB adjudicates \nchallenges to personnel actions taken under the civil service laws,\n51among \nother things, and OSC investigates and prosecutes prohibited personnel practices.\n52Other, more specific \nenactments confer upon these entities the obligations or authorities to promulgate regulations on specific topics. \nThe CSRA codified fundamental merit \nsystem principles, which had developed since 1883.\n53These principles are \nsummarized here: \nMerit System Principles54 \n1. Recruit, select, and advance on \nmerit after fair and open competition. \n2. Treat employees and applicants \nfairly and equitably. \n3. Provide equal pay for equal work \nand reward excellent performance. \n4. Maintain high standards of \nintegrity, conduct, and concern for the \npublic interest. 5. Manage employees efficiently and \neffectively. \n6. Retain or separate employees on the \nbasis of their performance. \n7. Educate and train employees if it \nwill result in better organizational or individual performance. \n8. Protect employees from improper \npolitical influence. \n9. Protect employees against reprisal \nfor the lawful disclosure of illegality and other covered wrongdoing. \nThe CSRA also established an \n\u2018\u2018elaborate new framework\u2019\u2019 related to civil service protections for employees in the competitive and excepted services. Challenges to non-appealable adverse actions, appealable adverse actions, and \u2018\u2018prohibited personnel practices\u2019\u2019 are channeled into separate procedural tracks.\n55The procedures an \nagency must follow in taking an adverse action and whether the agency\u2019s action is appealable to the MSPB depend on the action the agency seeks to impose. \nSuspensions of 14 days or less are not \ndirectly appealable to the MSPB.\n56But \nan employee against whom such a suspension is proposed is entitled to certain procedural protections, including notice, an opportunity to respond, representation by an attorney or other representative, and a written decision.\n57 \nMore rigorous procedures apply \nbefore agencies may pursue removals, demotions, suspensions for more than 14 days, reductions in grade and pay, and furloughs for 30 days or less, if the subject of the contemplated action meets the definition of an \u2018\u2018employee\u2019\u2019 under 5 U.S.C. 7511(a) by satisfying probationary or length of service conditions.\n58These employees, other \nthan those who are statutorily excepted from chapter 75\u2019s protections, receive the civil service protections outlined in 5 U.S.C. 7513.\n59Under section \n7511(a)(1), \u2018\u2018employee\u2019\u2019 refers to an individual who falls within one of three groups: (1) an individual in the competitive service who either (a) is not serving a probationary or trial period\n60 under an initial appointment; or (b) has \ncompleted 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less; (2) a preference eligible\n61in the \nexcepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency, or in the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission; or (3) an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible) who either (a) is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or (b) has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.\n62 \nIn the event of a final MSPB decision \nadverse to the employee, employees may seek judicial review by petitioning to the appropriate Federal appellate or district court.\n63 \nExcepted from these procedural \nprotections and rights to appeal conferred on other employees under chapter 75 are certain civil servants described in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b), including, among other categories not relevant here, those officers appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and other officers whom the President is permitted to appoint himself or herself. Also excepted are individuals \u2018\u2018whose position has been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\u2019\u2019\n64These \ndeterminations must be made by \u2018\u2018(A) the President for a position that the President has excepted from the competitive service; (B) the Office of Personnel Management for a position \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24987 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n655 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2). \n66See infra, Sec.

Higginbotham, \n403 U.S. 207 (1971)\u2014where the Court held that \npublic employees had due process rights. Before the Court explicitly recognized that restrictions on the loss of employment could create a property right, the Court protected statutorily-conferred public employment rights under other legal theories. See, e.g., United States v. Wickersham 210 U.S. 390, \n398\u2013399 (1906); Keim v. United States, 177 U.S. \n290, 296 (1900); see also Indiana ex rel. Anderson v. Brand (303 U.S. 95 (1938); Hall v.

Challenges to a \npersonnel action on the basis that it constitutes a prohibited personnel practice may be brought by anyone in a covered position, regardless of their entitlement to adverse action rights. that the Office has excepted from the \ncompetitive service; or (C) the President or the head of an agency for a position excepted from the competitive service by statute.\u2019\u2019\n65As detailed further in \nSection IV(B), it is evident that Congress, in using this and similar language in various parts of title 5, U.S. Code, intended this exception to apply to the voluntary filling of noncareer political appointments that carry no expectation of continued employment beyond the presidential administration during which the appointment occurred.\n66 \nThe unique responsibilities of \npolitically appointed employees, many of whom are listed under excepted service Schedule C, allow hiring and termination to be done purely at the discretion of the President or the President\u2019s political appointees. This is a specific exception from the competitive service and, for that reason, each position listed in Schedule C is revoked immediately upon the position becoming vacant.\n67Agencies may \nterminate political appointees at any time. This also means that, absent any unique circumstance provided in law\n68 \nor a request to stay by an incoming administration, these positions are vacated following a presidential transition. \nPrior to the CSRA, agencies relied \nonly on provisions codified at chapter 75 to remove Federal employees or to change an employee to a lower grade, even if the reason for removal was for unacceptable performance. The CSRA created chapter 43 of title 5, U.S. Code, as an additional process for empowering supervisors to address performance concerns.\n69Accordingly, in addition to \nusing the provisions of chapter 75, \nagencies can address performance concerns under chapter 43. Under this scheme established by Congress, the decision of which chapter to use is left to the discretion of the manager tasked with pursuing the action. \nThrough various enactments currently \nreflected in chapters 43 and 75, Congress has created conditions under which certain employees\u2014i.e., those \nwith the requisite tenure in continued employment\u2014may earn a property interest in that continued employment. For such employees, Congress has mandated that removal and the other actions described in subchapter II of chapter 75 may be taken only \u2018\u2018for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\u2019\u2019\n70This property interest in \ncontinued employment has been a feature of the Federal civil service since at least 1912, when the Lloyd-La Follette Act required just cause to remove a Federal employee. The Supreme Court in Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, recognized that \nrestrictions on loss of employment, such as tenure, can create a property right.\n71 \nIn Cleveland Board of Education v. \nLoudermill,72the Court also held: \nProperty cannot be defined by the \nprocedures provided for its deprivation any more than can life or liberty. The right to due process is conferred, not by legislative grace, but by constitutional guarantee. While the legislature may elect not to confer a property interest in public employment, it may not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of such an interest once conferred, without appropriate procedural safeguards.\n73 \nIn short, once a government requires \ncause for removals, constitutional due process protection will attach to that property interest and determine the minimum procedures by which a removal may be carried out. Any new law addressing the removal of a Federal employee with a vested property interest in the employee\u2019s continued employment must, at a minimum, comport with due process. This obligation drives some of the procedures in both chapters 43 and 75, while other procedures have been developed in accordance with Congress\u2019 assessments of what is good policy.\n74Regardless of \nthe nature of the particular action specified, agencies must follow the procedures specified by Congress to effectuate a removal under those chapters, as a matter of law, unless they are changed by Congress. \nAn advocacy nonprofit organization \nopposed to this rule argued that the Lloyd-La Follette Act and predecessor executive orders \u2018\u2018were not understood (or applied)\u2019\u2019 to give federal employees a property right to their jobs before \u2018\u2018the Supreme Court interpreted the Act as having that effect in Arnett v. Kennedy \n(1974).\u2019\u2019 Comment 4097. Commenter\u2019s point is incorrect, and, in any event, irrelevant. As observed in note 71 above, the Supreme Court recognized in earlier cases that due process rights could attach to public employment. And \nCongress, far from limiting or ending such rights, has enacted new statutes since Arnett, notably the CSRA and the \nCivil Service Due Process Amendments Act, conferring robust procedural rights on broader groups of Federal employees. In any event, although Congress has, from time to time, tinkered with the procedures required in various agency settings, it has done nothing since Arnett purporting to remove due \nprocess rights from incumbents who have accrued them, which suggests approval of the Supreme Court\u2019s approach in that case. \nFinally, in addition to establishing the \nrequirements and procedures for challenging adverse actions and performance-based actions, the CSRA includes a mechanism for an employee in a \u2018\u2018covered position\u2019\u2019 to challenge a \u2018\u2018personnel action\u2019\u2019 that constitutes a \u2018\u2018prohibited personnel practice\u2019\u2019 because it has been taken for a prohibited reason.\n75\u2018\u2018Covered position\u2019\u2019 means any \nposition in the competitive service, a career appointee in the Senior Executive Service, or a position in the excepted service unless \u2018\u2018conditions of good administration warrant\u2019\u2019 a necessary \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24988 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n765 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2)(B), 3302. \n77See 88 FR 63862, 63866. \n785 U.S.C. 2302(b).

There are, however, \nsome notable differences between non-removal \nprotections afforded to competitive service and excepted service employees, such as assignment rights in the event of a reduction in force. See 5 CFR \n351.501 and 502.

The CSRA, as described in the proposed rule,\n77also \ncodified a comprehensive list of prohibited personnel practices.\n78 \nC. The Competitive, Excepted, and Senior Executive Services \nThe CSRA also established a new \nservice\u2014the Senior Executive Service, or SES\u2014\u2018\u2018to ensure that the executive management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and is otherwise of the highest quality.\u2019\u2019\n79As \ndescribed further below, the SES is distinct from the competitive service and the excepted service.\n80It consists of \nsenior government officials, both noncareer and career, who share a broad set of responsibilities to help lead the work of the Federal Government. \nIn the competitive service, \nindividuals must complete a competitive hiring process before being appointed. This process may include a written test or an equivalent evaluation of the individual\u2019s relative level of knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for successful performance in the position to be filled.\n81 \nAlthough most government \nemployees are in the competitive service, about one-third are in the excepted service.\n82The excepted \nservice includes all positions in the Executive Branch that are specifically \nexcepted from the competitive service by statute, Executive order, or by OPM regulation.\n83For positions excepted \nfrom the competitive service by statute, selection must be made pursuant to the provisions Congress enacted for those positions. Applicants for excepted service positions under title 5, U.S. Code, like applicants for the competitive service, are to be selected \u2018\u2018solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition which assures that all receive equal opportunity.\u2019\u2019\n84Agencies filling \npositions in the excepted service \u2018\u2018shall select . . . from the qualified applicants in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service.\u2019\u2019\n85This means that agencies \nshould generally afford veterans\u2019 preference in the same manner they would have for the competitive service, though, in a few situations\n86where the \nreason for the exception makes this essentially impossible, OPM (or the President) has exempted the position from regulatory requirements and imposed a less stringent standard.\n87 \nThe President is authorized by statute \nto provide for \u2018\u2018necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service\u2019\u2019 when warranted by \u2018\u2018conditions of good administration.\u2019\u2019\n88The President has \ndelegated to OPM\u2014and, before that, to its predecessor, the CSC\u2014concurrent authority to except positions from the competitive service when it determines that appointments thereto through competitive examination are not practicable.\n89The President has further \ndelegated authority to OPM to \u2018\u2018decide whether the duties of any particular position are such that it may be filled as an excepted position under the appropriate schedule.\u2019\u2019\n90 \nOPM has exercised its delegated \nauthority, and implemented exercises of presidential authority, by prescribing five schedules for positions in the excepted service, which are currently listed in 5 CFR part 213: \u2022Schedule A\u2014Includes positions \nthat are not of a confidential or policy- \ndetermining character for which it is not practicable to examine applicants, such as attorneys, chaplains, and short-term positions for which there is a critical hiring need. \n\u2022Schedule B\u2014Includes positions \nthat are not of a confidential or policy- determining character for which it is not practicable to examine applicants. Unlike Schedule A positions, Schedule B positions require an applicant to satisfy basic qualification standards established by OPM for the relevant occupation and grade level. Schedule B positions engage in a variety of scientific, professional, and technical activities. \n\u2022Schedule C\u2014Includes positions \nthat are policy-determining or which involve a close and confidential working relationship with the head of an agency or other key appointed officials. These positions include most political appointees below the cabinet and subcabinet levels. \n\u2022Schedule D\u2014Includes positions \nthat are not of a confidential or policy- determining character for which competitive examination makes it difficult to recruit certain students or recent graduates. Schedule D positions generally require an applicant to satisfy basic qualification standards established by OPM for the relevant occupation and grade level. Positions include those in the Pathways Programs. \n\u2022Schedule E\u2014Includes positions of \nadministrative law judges.\n91 \nAs described supra, competitive and \nexcepted service incumbents, except those in Schedule C\u2014and others excluded under 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)\u2014 become \u2018\u2018employees\u2019\u2019 for purpose of civil service protections after they satisfy the probationary or length of service requirements in 5 U.S.C. 7511(a). Excepted service employees, except those in Schedule C and others excluded under section 7511(b), maintain the same notice and appeal rights for adverse actions and performance-based actions as competitive service employees.\n92 \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24989 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \nthe same tenure group and subgroup.

As described more fully in Section IV, the adverse action processes in 5 U.S.C. 7501\u20137515 and the exclusion from such \nrights and coverage in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b), do not apply to the SES. The SES adverse action procedures, unlike the rules governing the competitive and excepted services, make no mention\u2014 let alone an exception\u2014for positions of \u2018\u2018a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\u2019\u2019\n100 \nA member of the SES can be a career \nappointee, noncareer appointee, limited term appointee or limited emergency appointee. These terms are defined at 5 U.S.C. 3132(a).\n101Congress established \nrules restricting noncareer appointments, as well as limited term and limited emergency appointments.\n102The adverse action \nrights for SES set out in Subchapter V, 5 U.S.C. 7541\u20137543, apply only to career appointees to the SES. Removal of career employees for less than fully successful executive performance is governed by a separate provision at 5 U.S.C. 3592. By contrast, none of these provisions affect an agency head\u2019s ability to remove a member of the noncareer SES. \nD. The Prior Schedule F \nOn October 21, 2020, President \nDonald Trump issued Executive Order \n13957, \u2018\u2018Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service,\u2019\u2019 which risked altering the carefully crafted legislative balance that Congress struck in the CSRA.\n103That Executive Order, if fully \nimplemented, could have transformed the civil service by purportedly stripping adverse and performance- based action grievance and appeal rights from large swaths of the Federal workforce\u2014thereby turning them into at-will employees. It could have also sidestepped statutory requirements built into the Federal hiring process intended to promote the objective of merit-based hiring decisions. It would have upended the longstanding principle that a career Federal employee\u2019s tenure should be linked to their performance and conduct, rather than to the nature of the position that the employee encumbers. It also could have reversed longstanding requirements that, among other things, prevent political appointees from \n\u2018\u2018burrowing in\u2019\u2019 to career civil service jobs in violation of merit system principles. \nBefore it could be implemented, \nhowever, Executive Order 13957 was \nrevoked, and Schedule F abolished, by President Biden through Executive Order 14003, \u2018\u2018Protecting the Federal Workforce.\u2019\u2019\n104 \nOPM received many comments \nrelated to Schedule F from both proponents and critics of it and Executive Order 13957. The lawfulness and wisdom of the policy choices embodied in now-revoked Schedule F are in most respects outside the scope of this rulemaking. Regardless of whether Executive Order 13957 was a valid exercise of authority, it is not directly at issue here. Nonetheless, numerous commenters addressed the topic and OPM has determined that it would be prudent to set forth its views in response to those comments. The various parts of the Executive Order, Schedule F, and related comments are thus addressed below. The validity of this rule does not depend on the legality or wisdom of Executive Order 13957. \n1. Adverse Action Rights, Performance- \nBased Action Rights, and Appeals \nSection 5 of Executive Order 13957 \ndirected agency heads to review their entire workforces to identify any employees covered by chapter 75\u2019s adverse action rules (which apply broadly to employees in the competitive and excepted services) who occupied positions of a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating character.\u2019\u2019 These included positions the agency assessed for the first time, without guidance or precedent, to allegedly include these characteristics. Agencies were then to petition OPM for its approval to place them in Schedule F, a newly-created category of positions to be excepted from the competitive service. If these \npositions had been placed in Schedule F, the employees encumbering them would have, according to the text of the Executive Order, been stripped of any adverse action procedural rights and MSPB appeal rights under chapter 75 discussed supra. Thus, the Order \nattempted to subject employees to removal, at will, by virtue of the involuntary placement of the positions they occupied in this new schedule (and regardless of any rights they had already \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24990 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n105Since performance-based actions under 5 \nU.S.C. 4303 are tied, in part, to subchapter II of \nchapter 75, employees would purportedly have also been stripped of performance-based action procedural rights and MSPB appeal rights, had an agency chosen to proceed with an action under chapter 43. \n106E.O. 13957, sec. 1. \n107The Executive Order stated that \u2018\u2018[c]onditions \nof good administration . . . make necessary excepting such positions from the adverse action procedures set forth in chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code.\u2019\u2019 E.O. 13957, sec. 1. The \u2018\u2018conditions of good administration\u2019\u2019 language appears in 5 U.S.C. 3302. We note that Section 3302 is placed in Subchapter I of chapter 33, a subchapter addressing examination, certification, and appointment. It relates only to exclusions of positions from the competitive service requirements relating to those topics when conditions of good \nadministration warrant and does not purport to confer authority on the President to except positions from the adverse action provisions of chapter 75. Similarly, chapter 75 does not itself purport to confer authority on the President to except positions from the scope of chapter 75. The authority to regulate under chapter 75 is conferred directly upon OPM unlike the authority to regulate under section 3302, which is conferred upon the President. Compare 5 U.S.C. 7514 (\u2018\u2018The Office of Personnel Management may prescribe regulations to carry out the purpose of this subchapter . . .) to 5 U.S.C. 3302 (\u2018\u2018The President may prescribe rules governing the competitive service.\u2019\u2019). Of course, a President could order the Director of OPM to promulgate regulations relating to chapter 75. Any such rule, however, would then be subject to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. \n108Matters of importance can be raised to agency \nadministrators in various ways, such as by filing a complaint with an agency\u2019s Inspector General, raising concerns with an agency\u2019s human resources office, and filing a grievance. 109See infra notes 355\u2013359. \n110Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., \u2018\u2018Civil Service\u2014 \nAgency Responses and Perspectives on Former Executive Order to Create a New Schedule F Category for Federal Positions,\u2019\u2019 (Sept. 2022), https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105504.pdf. \n1115 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) (\u2018\u2018This subchapter does not \napply to an employee . . .

Validation generally \nrequires that the criteria and methods by which job applicants are evaluated have a rational accrued or any reliance on those \nrights).105 \nAn express rationale of this action \nwas to make it easier for agencies to \u2018\u2018expeditiously remove poorly performing employees from these positions without facing extensive delays or litigation.\u2019\u2019\n106This new \nsweeping authority was purportedly necessary for the President to have \u2018\u2018appropriate management oversight regarding\u2019\u2019 the career civil servants working in positions deemed to be of a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\u2019\u2019 and to incentivize employees in these positions to display what presidential appointees at an agency would deem to be \u2018\u2018appropriate temperament, acumen, impartiality, and sound judgment,\u2019\u2019 in light of the importance of these functions.\n107 \nExecutive Order 13957 did not acknowledge existing mechanisms to provide \u2018\u2018appropriate management oversight,\u2019\u2019 such as chapter 43 and chapter 75 procedures, or the multiple management controls that agencies have in place to escalate matters of importance to agency administrators.\n108 \nExecutive Order 13957 instructed \nagency heads to review existing positions to determine which, if any, should be placed into Schedule F. The Order also instructed that, after agency heads conducted their initial review, they were to move quickly and petition OPM by January 19, 2021\u2014the day before the Inauguration\u2014to place positions within Schedule F. After that, agency heads had another 120 days to petition OPM to place additional positions in Schedule F. \nIn contrast to past excepted service \nschedules designed to address unique hiring needs upon a determination that appointments through the competitive service was \u2018\u2018not practicable,\u2019\u2019\n109 \nmovement into Schedule F was designed to be broad and numerically unlimited, potentially affecting a substantial number of jobs across all Federal agencies. For example, according to the Government Accountability Office, the Office of Management and Budget petitioned to place 68 percent of its workforce within Schedule F.\n110Moreover, the Executive \nOrder did not make the underlying determination that particular positions were \u2018\u2018of a confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- \nadvocating character.\u2019\u2019\n111In essence, \nthe exception was created in advance of any determination. The Executive Order instead announced that any position that could be described in these terms, and which was not encumbered by an appointee under Schedule C, should be placed in a separate and new excepted service schedule. The Executive Order then directed agencies to determine \nwhich of their positions met that criterion and compile a list of individuals for OPM to consider placing in Schedule F. \n2. Hiring \nSection 3 of Executive Order 13957 \nprovided that \u2018\u2018[a]ppointments of \nindividuals to positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character that are not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition shall be made under Schedule F.\u2019\u2019\n112The stated rationale for removing \nthese positions from the competitive \nhiring process (or from other excepted service schedules in which some of these positions were previously placed) was, again, because of the importance of their corresponding duties and the need to have employees in these positions that display \u2018\u2018appropriate temperament, acumen, impartiality, and sound judgment.\u2019\u2019\n113The stated purpose was \nto \u2018\u2018provide agency heads with additional flexibility to assess prospective appointees without the limitations imposed by competitive service selection procedures\u2019\u2019\n114or, \npresumably, for positions already in the excepted service, without the constraints imposed by 5 CFR part 302. The Order indicated that this change was intended to \u2018\u2018mitigate undue limitations on their selection\u2019\u2019 and relieve agencies of \u2018\u2018complicated and elaborate competitive service processes or rating procedures that do not necessarily reflect their particular needs.\u2019\u2019\n115These changes were to give \nagencies \u2018\u2018greater ability and discretion to assess critical qualities in applicants to fill these positions, such as work ethic, judgment, and ability to meet the particular needs of the agency.\u2019\u2019\n116 \nThe Executive Order did not address \nthat the competitive hiring process permits agencies to assess all competencies that are related to successful performance of the job, including appropriate temperament, acumen, impartiality, and sound judgment. They also permit agencies to fulfill the congressional policy to confer a preference on eligible veterans or their family members entitled to derived preference. The qualifications requirements, specialized experience, interview process, and other assessment methodologies available to hiring managers facilitate an agency\u2019s ability to identify the best candidate. The Order also did not address the existence of longstanding rules, grounded in the need to establish lack of unlawful bias in proceedings under Federal anti- discrimination statutes, that require \nassessment of any such competencies.\n117The summary \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00010 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24991 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \nrelationship to performance in the position to be \nfilled. \n118See 5 U.S.C. 3320. \n11985 FR 67631, 67632\u201333 (sec. 4(i) (Schedule \nF)); see also 5 CFR part 302. 12088 FR 63862, 63867\u201369. \n121Id. \n122See also E.O. 14003 at 2 (providing a similar \nassessment). \n123The full cite to this opinion is 561 U.S. 477 \n(2010). 12488 FR 63862, 63871\u201373. \n125See also Comment 2134 (\u2018\u2018The preamble and \nthe regulation accurately reflect the executive \nbranch\u2019s historical understanding that Congress intended for the competitive service exception for \u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\u2019 positions to apply only to a small class of political appointee positions.\u2019\u2019). \n126OPM notes, though, that the rule does not \namend regulations related to prohibited personnel practices. imposition of new competencies would \nbe contrary to existing statutory requirements and could potentially be discriminatory in application, even if that were not the agency\u2019s intent. Finally, the Order recited that the normal statutory veterans\u2019 preference requirements that would have applied to identified positions\n118would not \napply, and that agencies would be required to apply veterans\u2019 preference requirements only \u2018\u2018as far as administratively feasible.\u2019\u2019\n119 \nAs noted above, OPM received many \ncomments about the prior Schedule F and its potential impacts on adverse action rights, performance-based action rights, appeals, and hiring. \nComments Regarding Departure of \nSchedule F From Precedents \nMany individuals and organizations \ncommented that Schedule F represented an unprecedented departure from Congressional intent, longstanding legal interpretations, and past practices. A joint comment by a nonprofit organization and former federal official agreed that Schedule F was \u2018\u2018an aberration, divorced from established legal interpretation and historical precedent\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018there can be no doubting that it would have disrupted the functions of government, even if ultimately overturned by the courts.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2134. The comment continued that \u2018\u2018even a small movement of positions into Schedule F would have amounted to presidential usurpation of the role of Congress, which has firmly enshrined the merit system in law to protect Americans and preserve democracy against authoritarian overreach.\u2019\u2019 Id. Other commenters \nargued that the process in which Schedule F was created was deficient because it intended to significantly alter longstanding statutory protections. Comment 1316 argued that \u2018\u2018[i]f the executive, or one of its appointees, wishes to change the operation of an agency, they must do so by lobbying for a change in the law that authorizes it or implement[ ] changes in accordance with those laws and the constraints of the Administrative Procedure Act.\u2019\u2019 A comment from Members of Congress stated that Schedule F not only would have \u2018\u2018jeopardize[d] the livelihoods of tens of thousands of hard-working, career civil servants,\u2019\u2019 but also would \u2018\u2018upend civil service precedent.\u2019\u2019 Comment 48. As explained in the proposed rule\n120and here, OPM agrees \nthat Schedule F risked altering the carefully crafted legislative balance that Congress struck in the CSRA and the history of protections leading up to it. \nTo be clear though, this rulemaking \ntakes no position on whether Executive Order 13957 was based on legal error, nor is this rulemaking premised on such a conclusion. Instead, as OPM explained in the proposed rule,\n121there were a \nnumber of existing mechanisms that would address the policy concerns identified in the Executive Order without establishing a new schedule, and the creation of Schedule F risked undermining other objectives of the civil service laws.\n122The basis for this \nrulemaking, as explained herein, is to clarify and reinforce the retention of accrued rights and status following an involuntary move to or within the excepted service and promulgate a definition of what it means to be a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 position consistent with decades of practice and how the Executive Branch, Congress, and the courts have understood that phrase to encompass political appointees. \nA few commenters opposed to this \nrule argued that the President has the authority to issue civil service reform in a manner like Schedule F. An advocacy nonprofit organization stated that the order was \u2018\u2018grounded on firm legal authority\u2019\u2019 because title 5 specifically authorizes the President to exempt policy-influencing positions from civil service appeals. Comment 4097. Commenter argued that \u2018\u2018statutory context makes clear\u2019\u2019 this authority extends to both political appointees and career officials. Commenter continued that the \u2018\u2018fact that prior presidents have restrained themselves in their dealings with subordinates does not imply they lacked this authority.\u2019\u2019 Id. Commenter \nasserted that the \u2018\u2018Supreme Court has already concluded that \u2018policymaking positions in government may be excepted from the competitive service to ensure presidential control, see 5 U.S.C. \n2302(a)(2)(B), 3302\u2019 (Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board, 2010).\u2019\u2019\n123 \nThe \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- \ndetermining, policy-making or policy- advocating\u2019\u2019 provision was intended to permit agency heads to directly appoint a cadre of political appointees who have a close and confidential working \nrelationship with the President\u2019s appointees to further and support the priorities of the President and the President\u2019s appointees. As discussed extensively throughout this final rule, the term of art, \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- advocating,\u2019\u2019 has a longstanding meaning that equates to political appointments, typically made under Schedule C. OPM, in this rulemaking, is defining that phrase as it is used in the statutory exception in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) for the reasons explained in the proposed rule\n124and in Section \nIV(B).125 \nComment 4097 also argued that a \nseparate provision, 5 U.S.C 2302(a)(2)(B), defining a \u2018\u2018covered position\u2019\u2019 for the purposes of protections from prohibited personnel practices, similarly excludes from protections positions excepted from the competitive service because of their \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\u2019\u2019 Commenter claimed this demonstrates that \u2018\u2018policymaking positions in government may be excepted from the competitive service to ensure presidential control.\u2019\u2019 Although this final rule does not directly amend regulations dealing with prohibited personnel practices, OPM construes this statutory language in 5 U.S.C 2302(a)(2)(B) as aligning with the reasoning in OPM\u2019s final rule with respect to chapter 75. It simply means that positions of a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating\u2019\u2019 character have long been understood to be political appointees and, in addition to not having adverse action rights, are not covered by protections against prohibited personnel practices.\n126That is perfectly consistent \nwith the nature of Schedule C employees. Congress has chosen to extend these protections only to the career civil service as described further in Section IV(B). \nThis commenter also cited 5 U.S.C. \n3302, which says a President may make necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service if \u2018\u2018conditions of good administration warrant,\u2019\u2019 to support the assertion that career policymaking positions in government \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24992 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n127See supra note 107. 128See 561 U.S. at 541. \n129Id. at 506. \n130Free Enterprise Fund notes that civil service \nstatutes in section 7511 contain an exception from \nadverse action rights for positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating character, but it did not define what those phrases mean. See 561 U.S. at 506. \n131141 S. Ct. 1970 (2021). 132See Whitman v. Am. Trucking Assocs., Inc., \n531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001). \n133In describing positions with confidential or \npolicy characteristics, E.O. 13957 states \u2018\u2018The heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) and the American people also entrust these career professionals with non-public information that must be kept confidential.\u2019\u2019 If that were the sole may be excepted from the competitive \nservice to ensure presidential control. Again, OPM\u2019s rule does not change this Presidential authority to except positions from the competitive service where necessary and where conditions of good administration warrant such action. But, as explained above, OPM disagrees that the authority to make exceptions in section 3302 also allows for the removal of incumbents\u2019 accrued adverse action rights under chapter 75.\n127Section 3302 and the \n\u2018\u2018warrant[ed]\u2019\u2019 by \u2018\u2018conditions of good administration\u2019\u2019 standard relates to whether positions should be excepted from the competitive service. Congress did not suggest\u2014in chapter 33 or chapter 75\u2014that the same standard also be used in determining whether to remove civil service protections for the incumbents of such positions. Further, as explained in Sections IV.(A)\u2013(B), OPM does not believe the exception in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) can remove the previously accrued adverse action rights of the incumbents of such positions. \nAs noted above, commenter also cited \nFree Enterprise Fund to support its assertion that the President can issue an action like Schedule F. The application of Free Enterprise Fund and other \nAppointments Clause and removal cases to this rulemaking are addressed further at Section III(F), but in short, commenter\u2019s reliance on this case is beside the point and inapt. Whether a president can lawfully enact Schedule F by executive order does not affect the ability of OPM to promulgate this rule pursuant to its authority. In any event, in Free Enterprise Fund, the Supreme \nCourt examined the constitutionality of multiple layers of removal restrictions for select positions at an independent agency (one layer of removal protections for the commissioners of the SEC and the next layer of protections for members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB or Board)). As an initial matter, most of the agencies that hire and fire subject to title 5 are not independent agencies, so they would not have multiple for-cause limitations on removal (i.e., most \nSecretaries, Directors, and other agency heads can be removed at will by the President). But even in most independent agencies, the removal restrictions at issue in Free Enterprise Fund are of limited relevance. There, \nthe Supreme Court focused specifically on the removal protections of Board members, whom the Court held were executive officers \u2018\u2018as the term is used in the Constitution\u2019\u2019 and who exercise \u2018\u2018significant authority.\u2019\u2019 It clarified that \u2018\u2018many civil servants within independent agencies would not qualify\u2019\u2019 as executive officers and none of the civil servants or corresponding protections addressed by the dissenting opinion introduce the same constitutional problems as those of the Board. One group the dissent specifically mentions are employees in the Senior Executive Service.\n128Even \nthough SES employees work on policy and have significant leadership responsibilities, they also have civil service protections. The majority states that \u2018\u2018none of the positions [the dissent] identifies,\u2019\u2019 which would include SES positions, \u2018\u2018are similarly situated to the Board.\u2019\u2019\n129\u2018\u2018Nor do the employees \nreferenced by the dissent enjoy the same significant and unusual protections from Presidential oversight as members of the Board,\u2019\u2019 the majority added. In other words, Free Enterprise Fund explicitly declined to hold that career SES positions, which have adverse action protections under 5 U.S.C. 7541\u2013 7543, pose constitutional concerns in and of themselves. Commenter invokes Free Enterprise Fund to argue that a lower-level strata of career civil servants (with fewer responsibilities and authority) cannot have civil service protections if they keep confidences or work on policy. But the Court stressed that \u2018\u2018[n]othing in our opinion, therefore, should be read to cast doubt on the use of what is colloquially known as the civil service system \nwithin independent agencies.\u2019\u2019 If nothing in Free Enterprise Fund casts doubt on the civil service system within independent agencies, it does not cast any doubt on the civil service system within the Executive Branch generally.\n130 \nFurther, in Free Enterprise Fund, the \nSupreme Court crafted a narrow remedy to address the unique problem the statute presented, holding that members of the Board would have to be removable at will by the Commission to render the statutory scheme consistent with the Constitution. More recently, in United States v. Arthrex,\n131the \nSupreme Court crafted a different remedial solution for another statutory scheme presenting employees with significant responsibilities who enjoyed statutory removal protections. Arthrex concerned Administrative Patent Judges (APJs), whose duties included sitting on \nthe Patent Trial and Appeal Board and issuing binding decisions. The Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, had held that APJs were principal officers whose appointments were unconstitutional because neither the Secretary nor Director could review their decisions or remove them at will. To remedy this constitutional violation, the Federal Circuit invalidated the APJs\u2019 tenure protections, making them removable at will by the Secretary. The Supreme Court, however, vacated and remanded, concluding that it was preferable to reform the statute to require the Director, a Presidential appointee who already oversaw APJs for other functions, to serve as a final reviewing and issuing official for decisions rendered by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The Court left the APJs\u2019 tenure provisions intact. The limited solutions adopted by the Supreme Court in Free Enterprise Fund and Arthrex are far \nremoved from a proposal to remove previously accrued adverse action rights from thousands of traditional civil servants simply because, for example, some of their work might touch on policymaking. Nothing in this rulemaking is contrary to Free Enterprise Fund or any other binding \nprecedent. On the other hand, an overwhelming number of precedents are contrary to commenter\u2019s positions, as described in this final rule. \nComment 4097 argued that \u2018\u2018[t]he \nCSRA also allows the President to except positions from the competitive service for the purpose of nullifying removal restrictions.\u2019\u2019 The Supreme Court has cautioned against using vague statutory provisions to alter \u2018\u2018fundamental details of a regulatory scheme,\u2019\u2019 stating that Congress \u2018\u2018does not hide elephants in mouseholes.\u2019\u2019\n132 \nCommenter seems to suggest that Congress did just that when it enacted the CSRA, even though that authority went undiscovered and unexercised for these purposes in over 40 years. Under this assertion, all a President would have to do is proclaim by unilateral order that \u2018\u2018good administration warrants\u2019\u2019 a change and the carefully balanced and longstanding civil service protections provided by Congress would fall away if the positions could be characterized as having a \u2018\u2018confidential\u2019\u2019\n133or \u2018\u2018policy\u2019\u2019 \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24993 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \nstandard for a \u2018\u2018confidential\u2019\u2019 position, it would be \nhard to think of a career position that would not have been \u2018\u2018confidential,\u2019\u2019 since the incumbents of virtually all positions have this obligation regarding non-public information.

That would be contrary to the very purpose of the CSRA, a result that Congress could not have possibly intended. \nAs explained in Comment 2134, a \njoint comment by a nonprofit organization and a former federal official, and further in Section IV(B), \nCongress, courts, and the Federal Government have parsed the meaning of the term of art \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- advocating\u2019\u2019 over at least the past 90 years and consistently viewed it as applying to noncareer political appointees.\n134Further, competitive \nservice employees have in the past been moved involuntarily to excepted service schedules that do not contain adverse action rights, but those incumbents have kept rights they have accrued (as detailed in Section IV(A)). Executive Order 13957 and Schedule F\u2019s attempt to strip accrued rights by moving positions into the excepted service would run contrary to longstanding precedent, including Roth v. \nBrownell,\n135as explained in Section \nIV(A). See Comment 2134. OPM \ntherefore disagrees with commenter\u2019s broad assertion that the CSRA allows the President to except positions from the competitive service \u2018\u2018for the purpose of nullifying removal restrictions.\u2019\u2019 \nComments Regarding Schedule F\u2019s Use \nof an Exception To Broadly Eliminate Adverse Action Rights \nCommenters supportive of the rule \nagreed with OPM and argued that, because the terms \u2018\u2018confidential\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018policy-making, policy-determining, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 are so broad, Schedule F had no limiting principle and used the exception in 7511(b)(2) to broadly swallow adverse action rights. A professor commented that the \u2018\u2018lack of clear definition and breadth of Schedule \nF allows it to serve as a promise for wide scale partisan retribution for any federal employee who might raise concerns about the legality of [a] policy agenda.\u2019\u2019 Comment 50. A labor union argued that \u2018\u2018the plain purpose of Schedule F was to create an exception so broad, it swallowed the rule of apolitical, merit based Federal employment and rendered meaningless the protections afforded to career Federal employees by the CSRA.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2640. As described in the proposed rule\n136and in this final rule, \nOPM shares some of these concerns. \nOne commenter opposed to this rule \nargued that the statutory exceptions in \n7511(b)(2) are broad enough to include career positions. Comment 4097 argued that \u2018\u2018[n]othing in the words \u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\u2019 hints at covering only political appointments or references the duration of an employee\u2019s tenure. Instead, the CSRA makes clear these terms cover both career and noncareer positions.\u2019\u2019 OPM disagrees that these words can be read in isolation or separated from their historical context and development. As explained in Section IV(B) and shown in Comment 2134, which extensively details the context, history, and meaning of these terms of art, they have, except in Executive Order 13957, always meant noncareer political appointees. Section 7511 was amended as part of the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990, in which Congress, for the first time, extended the ability to accrue adverse action rights (and for certain adverse actions, appeal rights) to individuals in the excepted service other than preference eligibles, who already had the ability to accrue such rights. Congress did not intend to undercut this extension of rights by permitting broad exclusions. In discussing what positions would be excluded from such rights, Congress stated that the bill \u2018\u2018explicitly denies procedural protections\u2019\u2019 to these types of political appointees\u2014\u2018\u2018presidential appointees, individuals in Schedule C positions [which are positions of a confidential or policy-making character] and individuals appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate,\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018[e]mployees in each of these categories have little expectation of continuing employment beyond the administration during which they were appointed\u2019\u2019 because they \u2018\u2018explicitly serve at the pleasure of the President or the presidential appointee who \nappointed them.\u2019\u2019\n137 \nWe also discuss below the argument \nthat Congress did not distinguish between career and noncareer positions in the SES in discussing the possibility that SES positions could involve policy- influencing duties. In brief, the SES was a new service, created in the CSRA and has its own distinct rules, rather than building on the existing structure of the competitive and excepted services. In the SES scheme, Congress did not need to address exclusions because the only SES appointees covered by the sections addressing procedural and appeal rights were career appointees. There was no attempt to distinguish between those whose duties could be regarded as policy-influencing and those whose duties could not be so characterized. Congress included separate provisions limiting the number of noncareer appointees. \nComment 4097 also suggested that \nconcerns about Schedule F are misguided because the schedule would have been limited to a small group of senior policy-influencing positions. There are approximately 4,000 political positions in the civil service (though some commenters noted between 20\u201325 percent of those usually remain unfilled). See Comment 2134.\n138Of \nthese, between 1,000 to 1,500 positions are Schedule C political appointees\u2014a number that has stayed relatively steady since the 1950s. See id. Comment 4097 estimates Schedule F would have covered between two and three percent of the federal workforce, which would have grown the positions vulnerable to political favor (even if not explicitly \u2018\u2018subject\u2019\u2019 to such favor) by over an order of magnitude, from 4,000 to 50,000 positions.

A former OPM official \ninvolved in the Schedule F approval process told \nGAO that \u2018\u2018positions above GS\u201311 were generally included\u2019\u2019 but OMB\u2019s approved petition \u2018\u2018also included positions at the GS\u20139 and GS\u201310 levels.\u2019\u2019 Id. at p. 19 & n.14. \n1415 CFR 213.3101 (describing Schedule A \npositions). \n142See Comment 4097, p. 24 (surmising that 90% \nof jobs are not policy-influencing). Because there are millions of civil servants, each percentage point in this estimate equates to a significant number of potentially impacted employees. 143See, e.g., James v. Von Zemensky, 284 F.3d \n1310 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (construing whether a \u2018\u2018staff adjustment\u2019\u2019 resulting in the separation of a physician in the Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs, could be appealed under the reduction-in-force statute and regulations, notwithstanding Congress\u2019 placement of VHA positions under title 38, U.S. Code, for at least some purposes); Harants v. U.S. Postal Serv., \n130 F.3d 1466 (Fed.

But as explained above and in the proposed rule,\n139the GAO found that Schedule F \nwas interpreted by agencies to have a broad reach, with one agency, for example, petitioning to place 68 percent of its workforce within Schedule F, including positions at the GS\u20139 level.\n140 \nConfirming that the number of \nemployees that would have been subject to Schedule F extends beyond senior positions responsible for agency policy, Comment 4097 included a spreadsheet labelling a career line attorney at an agency\u2019s general counsel\u2019s office as a \u2018\u2018policy\u2019\u2019 employee. OPM notes that government attorneys are generally Schedule A employees, and therefore, by definition, are specifically \u2018\u2018not of a confidential or policy-determining character,\u2019\u2019\n141but in any event, \nwhatever limiting principles commenter may have in mind for justifying Schedule F, they remain unclear. While commenter states that two to three percent of the federal workforce would have been impacted by Schedule F, \ncommenter then suggests that up to 10 percent of jobs\n142could fit its \ninterpretation of confidential and policy positions, which would equate to approximately 250,000 employees. The number of positions that could be covered by a Schedule F-type action is thus indeterminate and without meaningful boundary. \nCommenter added that, because of \nSchedule F\u2019s allegedly limited scope, OPM\u2019s recruitment concerns are \u2018\u2018meritless.\u2019\u2019 It claimed that \u2018\u2018Schedule F would have virtually no applicability to technical positions such as IT and cybersecurity that OPM cites as ongoing recruitment challenges.\u2019\u2019 This statement certainly does not capture the nature of cybersecurity and other technical positions which require the maintenance of confidences while fending off cyberattacks from foreign countries or domestic bad actors with respect to data breaches, for example. It is difficult to imagine situations where the requirement to maintain confidences \nwould be more important. Commenter concluded that OPM does not \u2018\u2018offer any evidence that making confidential and policy-influencing career positions at- will\u2014as opposed to converting them to political appointments\u2014would create recruitment challenges.\u2019\u2019 As detailed further in Section V.(B), regarding the impact of politicization on recruitment, hiring, and retention, OPM received a significant number of comments concerned about the negative impacts of Schedule F, or a similar effort, on federal civil service recruitment. Because of Schedule F\u2019s unprecedented treatment of the confidential and policy exception in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b), the concerns about such a schedule were broad and not isolated to discrete parts of the workforce. For instance, concerned commenters included academic researchers showing the negative impact of politicization on recruitment to individuals, including those in IT and technical positions who expressed that the existence of an action like Schedule F would dissuade them from seeking federal employment. \nComments Regarding Schedule F and \nPoliticization in Hiring and Firing \nComment 4097 also argued that, \ncontrary to widespread opinion, \nSchedule F rejected the spoils system and was sufficiently protective from the dangers of politicization. Commenter contended that \u2018\u2018if E.O. 13957 was intended to fill the bureaucracy with political loyalists, President Trump chose an extremely odd way of doing it. He could have directly converted career positions to political positions, dismissed career incumbents through a reduction in force, and filled the roles with political appointees.\u2019\u2019 None of these alternatives is simple or free of costs. For instance, additional Schedule C positions would require an agency to budget for and create new slots, obtain OPM\u2019s approval of such slots, and pursue a variety of other procedural steps designed to sustain civil service protections and merit system principles. Reductions in force are complex and the outcomes are unpredictable. They have often been the subject of extended litigation.\n143 Commenter argued that the White \nHouse Office of Presidential Personnel \nwould not have been involved in Schedule F appointments, but commenter does not address why that would promote efficiency or lead to less agency politicization. The prior administration was slow to fill even the political slots at its disposal and many remained unfilled. See, e.g., Comment 2124 (\u2018\u2018Increasing [politically-based appointments] by a factor of 5 or more will certainly mean that more jobs will go unfilled and more tasks will go uncompleted.\u2019\u2019). Under Schedule F, agency political and career leadership could target, interview, and/or select politically-aligned applicants just as well as PPO. \nRegarding Schedule F\u2019s purported \nprotections from the dangers of politicization, an advocacy nonprofit organization argued that \u2018\u2018Schedule F made sure to protect these policymaking employees from discriminatory firing based on political beliefs or party allegiance.\u2019\u2019 See Comment 3892; see \nalso Comment 2346. Once hirings and \nfirings are at-will, however, the employee might not have an entitlement to written notice of the reasons for the adverse action, an opportunity to respond, or a written decision.\n144Nor \nwould the decision generally be appealable.\n145It would thus be, at a \nminimum, difficult for employees to protect themselves from actions based on political beliefs or party allegiance because no cause (or evidence) would be required prior to such an action. Under Schedule F, because such an employee would be at-will, the employer would need to give little or no reason prior to a termination. In short, Schedule F leaves innumerable ways for politics to factor into these traditionally merit-based decisions in a manner that would be difficult to detect or remedy. \nComment 4097 contended that \n\u2018\u2018OPM\u2019s concerns about a return to the patronage system also ignore the evidence that the Federal Government ended patronage because it had become obsolete\u2019\u2019 and passed the Pendleton Act because \u2018\u2018patronage no longer served their interests.\u2019\u2019 Although the influence of politics in the civil service was greatly diminished following the Pendleton Act, it has taken consistent legislative, executive, and regulatory action to stem the tide of patronage over the past 140 years.

Comment 2134 gave an overview of the \nelection of 1936, which featured concerns about the return of the spoils system, and executive action in the 1950s to create Schedule C due to concerns that political actors were burrowing in as career civil servants. As previously mentioned, the CSRA was enacted in the aftermath of the Nixon Administration\u2019s plan to implement the Malek Manual, a blueprint to replace the civil service merit system with a political hiring scheme that would begin by purging all Democrats from federal employment. \nComment 4097 also contended that \ntoday\u2019s rank-and-file government jobs are not enticing enough to invite patronage and that \u2018\u2018the really big bucks aren\u2019t in the political appointments game.\u2019\u2019 At the same time, commenter argued that confidential and policy positions are so important to the functioning of government that the President should have unfettered control over these positions. Executive Order 13957 likewise justified removing protections from these positions because the \u2018\u2018importance of the functions they discharge.\u2019\u2019 Commenter seems to recognize the threat of unqualified individuals discharging important functions. OPM agrees that qualified individuals should discharge important functions, and this rule is based on OPM\u2019s determination that injecting politicization into the nonpartisan career civil service (or creating the conditions where it can be injected by individual actors) runs counter to merit system principles and would not only harm government employees, agencies, and services, but also the American people that rely on them, as discussed in the proposed rule\n146and further \nbelow. \nComments Regarding Schedule F as a \nPerformance Management Tool \nOne of the justifications for Schedule \nF was that it allegedly allowed agencies to address poor performance, but many \ncommenters asserted that this rationale was flawed and a pretext for removing protections and culling the civil service of dissenting opinions. Comment 13, a former OMB official, commented that \u2018\u2018[t]he proponents of Schedule F claim that it is needed for accountability and to be able to fire poor performers. Yet they offer little or no support for their claims. Thousands of poor performers are dismissed annually, and even more are transferred to other positions.\u2019\u2019 This commenter argued that the last Administration\u2019s \u2018\u2018own presidential appointees [were the ones] who most visibly resisted his directives, not career civil servants.\u2019\u2019\n147Comment 2816, a \nformer federal official, argued that Schedule F \u2018\u2018relied on vague and conclusory assertions that competitive selection procedures inhibit the hiring of candidates with appropriate \u2018work ethic, judgment, and ability to meet the particular needs of the agency,\u2019 and that more \u2018flexibility to expeditiously remove poorly performing employees\u2019 was needed without any consideration of the countervailing considerations that favor strong employee protections.\u2019\u2019 See also Comment 3803. A professor argued \nthat it was not civil service incompetence that spurred Schedule F, but competence. Comment 42. \u2018\u2018This \ncompetence insisted on following scientific consensus on climate change. It insisted that cures such as ivermectin and hydroxyquinoline would not treat Covid-19. The legal expertise in the federal bureaucracy insisted that impounding funds that Congress had explicitly delegated for Ukraine was illegal. These are some of the most prominent examples of bureaucratic competence coming into conflict with the preferences\u2019\u2019 of the previous Administration. Id. Finally, commenters \nnoted that, while some want to \u2018\u2018eliminate incompetent people or redundant roles\u2014[ ] allowing elected officials to hand-pick civil service members prevents neither.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2828. \nOPM agrees that Schedule F was \npoorly designed as an effort to meaningfully improve performance management or allow managers to more effectively address performance issues. Agencies were directed to move employees occupying \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 positions into Schedule F, thereby purportedly making them at-will employees who could be terminated without any adverse action procedures. But the characteristics of an employee\u2019s job\u2014including whether the employee works on policy\u2014has nothing to do with an employee\u2019s performance. Schedule F sought to streamline terminations based on the type of work that an employee performs, not based on how well the employee performs. It is therefore difficult to understand how Schedule F can be reconciled with its purported aim of addressing poor performance. \nIf the concern is that managers face \nsome difficulties in attempting to take actions under chapter 75 or chapter 43, the solution is not for the Executive \nBranch to issue an executive order seeking to undermine those statutory provisions. Nor would such an executive order effectively address the complexity of the various remedial schemes Congress has created. For example, creating Schedule F will do nothing to prevent a particular employee from lodging a complaint of unlawful discrimination under the various civil rights statutes; will do nothing to stop administrative judges of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from presiding over discovery in relation to such claims and adjudicating them; and may result in decisions adverse to managers that will then be non-reviewable in a Federal court. Similarly, excepting individuals from adverse action rights would likely lead to attempts to file constitutional claims in the Federal district courts, thereby defeating the benefits of the claim-channeling provisions of the CSRA.\n148 \nStill, some commenters argued that \nSchedule F was a valid tool to remove poor performers and increase accountability. For instance, Comment 7 contended that \u2018\u2018Schedule F and similar tools \u2018aim[ ] to increase accountability and efficiency in the Federal government by removing \u2018poor- performing employees.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 See also Comments 45, 1811, 3130; 4097. Comment 4097, an advocacy nonprofit organization, argued that civil service protections and merit-based hiring procedures \u2018\u2018make it difficult to hire the best candidates and prohibitively difficult to dismiss employees for all but the worst offenses.\u2019\u2019 With respect to merit-based hiring procedures, we observe that even if we accepted this premise as true, which OPM does not, commenter ignores the fact that merit- based hiring procedures contained in title 5 are the law of the land. If a \ncommenter believes they \u2018\u2018make it difficult to hire the best candidates\u2019\u2019 the solution is to make this argument to Congress, not attempt to evade the requirements established in title 5. We also note that many of the \u2018\u2018difficulties\u2019\u2019 commenter observes arise from the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, as amended, which is codified throughout title 5\u2019s provisions on hiring. An observer might argue that there should be no veterans\u2019 preference, but that would seem a grave disservice to the sacrifice and commitment of veterans across the Nation. And even if a persuasive policy argument in favor of veterans\u2019 preference reform could be made, it \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24996 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n149See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Treasury Employees Union v. \nHorner, 854 F.2d 490 (D.C.

The Federal court of appeals, on review from a district court determination that OPM had violated the Administrative Procedure Act in excepting this broad category from the competitive service, noted that filling positions through the competitive process was the norm and OPM could depart from that norm only when \u2018\u2018necessary\u2019\u2019 for \u2018\u2018conditions of good administration,\u2019\u2019 quoting 5 U.S.C. 3302. The court also noted that OPM, while asserting that the cost of developing a new examination was prohibitive, did not present evidence that would meet the standard of review. Cf. Gingery v.

This guidance advises agencies to periodically remind supervisors and managers about the value of the probationary period and to make an affirmative decision regarding the probationer\u2019s fitness for continued employment.

Attempts to create unwarranted exceptions to avoid legal requirements have been counterproductive and resulted in substantial litigation.\n149 \nAs to difficulties dealing with \u2018\u2018poor \nperformers,\u2019\u2019 there already exist a variety of tools to address inappropriate conduct and unacceptable performance and civil servants are removed using these tools, as described above and explored further below in the Section V.(B). Commenter also does not address civil servants who are terminated during their probationary/trial periods or before they have met their durational requirements when their civil service protections would attach. The purpose of probation is to permit observation of new appointees on the job before their appointments became permanent. It is sometimes described as the final stage of the examining process. Such filtering, when done properly, addresses many performance issues early and grants the agency wide latitude to remove that worker.\n150 \nCommenter attributes any \nmisalignment with a President\u2019s political agenda (or \u2018\u2018policy resistance\u2019\u2019) as \u2018\u2018misconduct\u2019\u2019 which justifies termination, even if such conflict cannot be proved. But a mere difference of opinion with leadership does not qualify as misconduct or unacceptable performance or otherwise implicate the efficiency of the service in a manner that would warrant an adverse action. To the contrary, identifying objections to government action early in internal discussions ultimately strengthens government policy by addressing meritorious considerations and explaining why other objections are unwarranted. Moreover, Executive branch employees have an affirmative obligation to report waste, fraud, and abuse to appropriate authorities, which could fall under commenter\u2019s broad notion of \u2018\u2018policy resistance\u2019\u2019\n151and is \nanother reason this notion is unworkable \nComment 4097 cited some examples \nof what commenter considers to be poor performance, misconduct, or other justifications for Schedule F. Comment 2822, a legal nonprofit organization, examined many of those examples and those in Tales from the Swamp, written by the same author as Comments 3156 and 4097 and cited throughout those two comments. It concluded that Tales from the Swamp \u2018\u2018regularly engages in cherry-picking, slanted interpretation, and outright inaccuracy to justify its conclusions in support of Schedule F.\u2019\u2019 Regarding Tales from the Swamp\u2019s \ncomplaints about agency losses in court, Comment 2822 stated it \u2018\u2018makes a substantial and baseless leap\u2019\u2019 from the previous Administration\u2019s \u2018\u2018loss rate in court (true) to career staff sabotage being the culprit (unsupported).\u2019\u2019 Comment 2822 explained that \u2018\u2018the most thorough report prepared on the\u2019\u2019 previous Administration\u2019s \u2018\u2018record in court found that the Administration regularly \u2018ignored clear-cut statutory and regulatory duties,\u2019 with losses on statutory interpretation grounds making up the bulk (117) of the administration\u2019s losses in court.\u2019\u2019\n152In many of these \ncases, \u2018\u2018the Administration lost \u2018because the agency had acted outside of the bounds of its authority or had adopted an interpretation that blatantly contradicted the statute at issue.\u2019 These losses were the result of unlawful policy efforts by political decisionmakers, not the product of agency staff doing a poor job of building a rulemaking record.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2822 criticized Tales from the Swamp\u2019s other examples of alleged poor performance\n153and finds \u2018\u2018many of the \nanecdotes relied on by TFTS lack \ncrucial context, or mischaracterize important facts about agencies\u2019 work\u2019\u2019 and the \u2018\u2018only thing these anecdotes consistently show is that some political appointees\u2019\u2019 during the last Administration \u2018\u2018occasionally found it challenging to implement their regulatory goals. But that experience is not unique to Trump-era political appointees, and it does not justify reorienting the civil service towards political fealty.\u2019\u2019 \nMany commenters argued that, \ninstead of poor performance or accountability, Schedule F was motivated by a desire to increase political loyalty in nonpartisan career civil servants. A professor argued that the previous administration has touted the prior Schedule F as a way \u2018\u2018to impose personal loyalty tests, and to use government as an instrument of his power. This is at odds with the purpose and traditions of the American state.\u2019\u2019 Comment 50; see also Comments 448, 1779. Other commenters pointed to \nnumerous public statements which, they argue, demonstrate the intent behind Schedule F, including calls from the previous Administration to \u2018\u2018root out\u2019\u2019 political opponents, referring to civil servants as the \u2018\u2018deep state\u2019\u2019 that needs to be \u2018\u2018destroyed\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018brought to heel,\u2019\u2019 and statements that they would \u2018\u2018pass critical reforms making every executive branch employee fireable by the president of the United States.\u2019\u2019 See Comments 50, 668, 2512 (citing news articles documenting the previous Administration and its supporters\u2019 desire to purge the civil service), 3398. Such firings would likely be at odds with statutory, regulatory, or constitutional protections and rights as explained in this final rule. \n3.

OPM \nhas long required that \u2018\u2018politics play no role when agencies hire political appointees for career Federal jobs.\u2019\u2019\n154 \nOPM adopted procedures to review \nappointments of such individuals for compliance and Congress has now essentially codified that procedure by requiring OPM to submit periodic reports of its findings.\n155Executive \nOrder 13957, interpreted broadly, could have opened the door for agency heads to move current political appointees into new Schedule F positions, or transferred vacancies in existing positions to Schedule F, without competition and in a manner not based on merit system principles. In effect, this would have allowed political appointees on Schedule C appointments, who would normally expect to depart upon a presidential transition, to \u2018\u2018burrow\u2019\u2019 into permanent civil service appointments. \nComments Regarding Schedule F and \nBurrowing In \nOne commenter argued that Schedule \nF would have reduced burrowing in because the burrowed employee would be removable at will anyway. See Comment 4097. That view overlooks the ability of burrowed employees to obtain a job in the first place because these employees could be hired into Schedule F without the usual filters for qualifications currently in place in the competitive civil service. Schedule F would have allowed unqualified employees to be hired, albeit at will, who may never have been able to enter the competitive service. Regardless of whether employees moved would be ultimately removable, the opening of the door to the conversion of Schedule C political appointees to Schedule F positions\u2014or, indeed, the hiring of any number of new candidates because they were politically aligned with the existing administration\u2014increased the risk of burrowing in. We discuss burrowing further in Section IV(A). \n4. Additional Comments Regarding the \nPotential Impacts of Schedule F \nComments Regarding Potential Negative \nOutcomes of Schedule F \nSeveral former and current civil \nservants, individuals, organizations, and Members of Congress commented on \nwhat they perceived as the negative aspects of Schedule F. A former OMB official contended that Schedule F would inhibit, if not prevent, successful presidential transitions and would degrade the performance of government employees by replacing career civil servants with political appointees. Comment 13. A professor contended that \u2018\u2018[t]aking qualified and even expert civil servants and making them weigh the tradeoff between voicing the views based on their expertise and keeping their jobs would utterly undermine their expertise.\u2019\u2019 Comment 42. Also \u2018\u2018it would mean that presidents would not be getting advice based on expertise but on what employees thought they wanted to hear\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Congressional will as expressed in the statutes that enable the executive branch to make policy would be discounted.\u2019\u2019 Not only would career civil servants and institutional expertise be harmed (see Comment 2267), but \ncommenters, including Members of Congress, detailed the potential impact of Schedule F to communities, small businesses, and families across America (Comment 48); the environment (Comment 33); National Park Service personnel, national parks, and the public who values them (Comment 1094); critical infrastructure (Comment 2501); federal investigations and prosecutions (Comment 2616); and the SNAP program and other hunger safety nets (Comment 3149); to name a few. \nSeveral commenters expressed \nconcerns about the potential impact of Schedule F on whistleblowers. Comment 3340, a whistleblower protection nonprofit organization, argued that \u2018\u2018Schedule F would have given the President blank check discretion to cancel the Whistleblower Protection Act by removing employees from the competitive service,\u2019\u2019 removing their civil service protections, and then firing them. See also Comments 3466, 3894. If Schedule F allowed removals at will, commenters claimed that it would be difficult to prove an employee was removed because of protected and important whistleblowing activities. Also, if an incumbent was in a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-making, policy- determining, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 position for the purposes of adverse action protections and excluded from such protections under section 7511(b)(2), as Schedule F attempted, then such a position would also presumably be excluded from the definition of \u2018\u2018covered position\u2019\u2019 for the purposes of the prohibited personnel \npractices under section 2302(a)(2)(B)(i). \nA professor commented that Schedule \nF would also have weakened legislative power. Comment 50 expressed that \u2018\u2018[t]he Founders were deeply concerned with the amassing of centralized power, and Schedule F frustrates the institutional design of checks and balances. In particular, it weakens legislative power. The creation of the civil service system was a response to a spoils system that led to abuses of state resources and power.\u2019\u2019 \nAnother commenter identified \npossible costs of Schedule F. Commenter argued that \u2018\u2018a likely consequence of Schedule F would be a greater reliance on private contractors to carry out the work of federal government agencies\u2019\u2019 and a \u2018\u2018[g]reater reliance on contractors would, almost certainly, be more expensive than our current system.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2109. Commenter further noted that \u2018\u2018the federal government is the source of a considerable amount of scientific and economic data that both businesses and researchers around the world trust and rely upon\u2019\u2019 and argued that this \u2018\u2018data is trusted precisely because it is curated by career civil servants who are free from political influence. If concerns about political influence in the generation of this data begin to seep into the public consciousness, enormous amounts of social value will be lost.\u2019\u2019 Id. \nComments Regarding Schedule F and \nthe Pendleton Act \nOne commenter who opposed the rule \nargued that the 19th-century reformers who created America\u2019s civil service believed that tenure and job protections were \u2018\u2018inimical to merit\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018[t]he Pendleton Act consequently deliberately made minimal changes to the dismissal process\u2019\u2019 besides prohibiting removal for making or failing to make \u2018\u2018political contributions.\u2019\u2019 Comment 4097. Commenter, an advocacy nonprofit organization, argued that Schedule F would have \u2018\u2018returned the federal civil service to its foundations.\u2019\u2019 While the Pendleton Act focused on merit-based hirings, Congress did address removals even at this early stage in the development of the career civil service\u2014it forbade removals on political or religious grounds.\n156 \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24998 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \nfollows: . . .

Van Riper, \u2018\u2018History of the United \nStates Civil Service,\u2019\u2019 at p. 102 (1958). 161David Rosenbloom, \u2018\u2018Federal Service and the \nConstitution,\u2019\u2019 at pp. 87\u201388; Van Riper, supra note \n160, at p. 102. Commenter adds that the reformers \nwho created the civil service feared that \nrequiring \u2018\u2018a virtual trial at law\u2019\u2019 to dismiss an employee would \u2018\u2018entrench incompetence and intransigence in the federal workforce\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018[n]ot until the 1960s did the general federal workforce gain the ability to appeal dismissals. The experience of the past six decades has demonstrated the folly of that decision.\u2019\u2019 This may be commenter\u2019s conclusion, but Congress has concluded otherwise and repeatedly strengthened employee rights during the period in question\u2014through the CSRA, the Civil Service Due Process Amendments Act of 1990, and the Whistleblower Protection Act and its amendments.\n157Moreover, at the time \nof the Pendleton Act\u2019s enactment, there was a rigorous debate about the extent of merit-based hirings and removals protections and the compromise position on the latter was that further removal protections were unnecessary at the time because hiring based on merit would \u2018\u2018remov[e] the temptation to an improper removal.\u2019\u2019\n158 \nCommenter quotes from George William Curtis, one of the drafters of the Pendleton Act, regarding the \u2018\u2018fear\u2019\u2019 of \u2018\u2018virtual trial[s] at law,\u2019\u2019 but further context is important here too. Curtis\u2019 longer quote starts \u2018\u2018[h]aving annulled all reason from the improper exercise of the power of dismissal, we hold that it is better to take the risk of occasional injustice from passion and prejudice, which no law or regulation can control, than to seal up incompetency, negligence, insubordination, insolence, and every other mischief in the service, by requiring a virtual trial at law before an unfit or incapable clerk can be removed.\u2019\u2019\n159Removing improper bases \nfor removals was a key antecedent to the statement regarding virtual trials at law. Curtis added, \u2018\u2018If the front door [is] properly tended, the back door [will] take care of itself.\u2019\u2019\n160At the time, this meant that, if civil service restrictions \nprevented the President from appointing a hand-picked replacement for a person he removed, his incentive to remove for political reasons would be diminished.\n161 \nRegardless of how the Pendleton Act \nshould be best interpreted, Congress has since established procedures set out in the CSRA and other laws, which channels employee appeals to an administrative agency, the MSPB, and reviewing courts. \nComments Regarding Comparison of \nSchedule F to State-Level Civil Service Reforms \nComment 4097 also argued that \nseveral states have adopted policies like Schedule F and that such efforts have proven successful. Commenter asserted that Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Texas, and Utah have instituted Schedule F-type reforms and concluded that \u2018\u2018[e]valuations generally show positive results, while fears of a return to patronage failed to materialize.\u2019\u2019 \nAs explained in the following \nsections, OPM received comments from civil servants in these states that described the various ways in which they believe that their jobs have worsened because of these reforms. Also, a former federal official counters Comment 4097\u2019s assertion about the benefits of these state reforms. See Comment 2816. The former federal official cited a \u2018\u2018lengthy survey of state- level civil service changes that reduced civil service protections in the 2000s\u2019\u2019 which found that \u2018\u2018in many cases, reforms were politically driven efforts to establish and defend political actors\u2019 capacities . . . to carry out the agendas of elected executives, legislators, and other policy makers.\u2019\u2019 The study notes that some State governors \u2018\u2018aggressively pushed reforms designed to remove merit system barriers to direct and tighten policy control over state agencies and their employees.\u2019\u2019 These types of initiatives, as with Schedule F, \u2018\u2018are often \u2018sold\u2019 in terms of a need to enhance executive leadership and accountability for results and, inevitably, to allow the removal of the legions of \u2018unresponsive, incompetent, insulated, bureaucrats\u2019 who the public is easily convinced lurk in the shadows of state agencies.\u2019\u2019 The report continues that \u2018\u2018there has been \u2018[g]rowing awareness among policy makers, public employees and their organizations, and human resource professionals that\u2019 state-level reforms to weaken civil \nservice protections \u2018have not delivered the benefits they promised and may well dampen enthusiasm for [similar] initiatives by the states that contemplate sudden, wholesale, changes in existing arrangements.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Comment 2816 continued that, in their study of civil service employee responses to Georgia\u2019s reforms, \u2018\u2018these authors found measurable decline in the number of employees saying they liked their jobs and an increase in those intending to leave employment within the coming year. Employees did not believe the reforms would result in high-performing employees being rewarded, did not trust that performance would take precedence over office politics, and did not believe as much as before the changes that performance appraisals were conducted fairly and believing they understood their job expectations.\u2019\u2019 The study concludes that \u2018\u2018[o]ver 75 percent of state employees disagreed that the reforms \u2018had resulted in a state workforce that is now more productive and responsive to the public.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 OPM finds this comment and study persuasive as a more rigorous examination than Comment 4097\u2019s conclusions that some HR professionals believe at-will status is useful and an \u2018\u2018essential piece of modern government management.\u2019\u2019 It also undercuts Comment 4097\u2019s argument that OPM \u2018\u2018ignore[s] the evidence from the states that at-will employment is both consistent with a merit system and can improve government performance.\u2019\u2019 Comment 4097 does not show that these changes are consistent with merit system principles nor that they improve performance. It also did not identify the metrics by which performance could improve; it just stated that they make employees more responsive and give management more flexibility. \nComments Regarding Potential Effect of \nSchedule F on the Number of Political Appointees \nCommenters opposed to the rule \nargued that the civil service does not have enough political appointees and Schedule F would have given administrations greater control over the federal workforce and priorities. Comment 3190, a law school clinic, contended that \u2018\u2018Schedule F proposed to expand the class of political appointees from roughly 4,000 positions to 20,000\u2013 50,000 positions\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018[u]nder such a modest change, political \nappointees would still constitute only 2.5 percent of the federal workforce.\u2019\u2019 As explained further below and in Comment 2134, a joint comment by a nonprofit organization and former \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n24999 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n162The overall number of federal employees has \nalso remained relatively stable.

Mortgage Bankers Ass\u2019n, 575 \nU.S. 92, 101 (2015) (agencies under the Administrative Procedure Act must \u2018\u2018use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance\u2019\u2019). federal official, the number of political \nappointees has stayed relatively stable for 70 years, so such a change would be anything but \u2018\u2018modest.\u2019\u2019\n162Also, this \ncomment appears to concede that a possible, and perhaps desired, effect of Schedule F was to create a new category of \u2018\u2018political appointees.\u2019\u2019 This runs counter to Comment 3156, written by the same author as Comment 4097. Comment 3156 takes issue with Comment 50, saying Comment 50\u2019s characterization of Schedule F positions as \u2018\u2018political appointees is simply wrong.\u2019\u2019 Comment 4097 then argued that Schedule F was designed to \u2018\u2018keep these policy-influencing positions in the career civil service,\u2019\u2019 such that they would not be political appointees. Even amongst proponents of Schedule F and opponents of this rulemaking, there are disagreements regarding what Schedule F meant and the breadth of its potential effects on the civil service. And one aspect of a \u2018\u2018career\u2019\u2019 appointment, as that term has long been understood, is the opportunity to serve the United States across administrations with the concomitant accrual of career status and adverse action rights\u2014an opportunity Schedule F would have jeopardized. \nUltimately, President Biden rescinded \nExecutive Order 13957 before any positions could be placed into Schedule F. As noted above, on January 22, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14003, \u2018\u2018Protecting the Federal Workforce,\u2019\u2019 rescinding Executive Order 13957, stating that \u2018\u2018it is the policy of the United States to protect, empower, and rebuild the career Federal workforce,\u2019\u2019 and that the Schedule F policy \u2018\u2018undermined the foundations of the civil service and its merit system principles.\u2019\u2019\n163 \nIf a future Administration concludes \nthat a policy that implements the principles of Schedule F is preferable to this rule and seeks to rescind this rule and replace it with such a policy, a future Administration would need to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act and principles of reasoned decision-making.\n164For example, to rescind this rule and replace it with a new Schedule F-type policy, a future Administration would need to, among other things: explain how the new policy is consistent with the carefully crafted legislative balance that Congress struck in the CSRA; set forth reasons for why it is departing from OPM\u2019s prior determination, reconfirmed here, that creating a new schedule for at-will employees who are not political appointees\u2014similar to Schedule F\u2014is inconsistent with that balance; justify the departure from the fundamental principle that career Federal employees\u2019 tenure should be linked to their performance rather than to the nature of their position; address whether that departure is consistent with the accrued property interests of employees, the settled expectations of career Federal employees\u2019 tenure, and the decisions individuals have made in response to those expectations; explain why any novel definition of \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\u2019\u2019 is consistent with the CSRA; discuss why that novel definition is being adopted even though it departs from long-established understandings\u2014 reconfirmed in this preamble\u2014of what that phrase means; and explain how a new policy would (1) ensure that new hires formerly required to go through the competitive hiring process have the knowledge, ability, expertise, and skills necessary to work effectively; (2) adequately protect career Federal employees against potential political retaliation or coercion; and (3) make \ncertain that critical positions in the federal workforce currently and ably held by career Federal employees will continue to function even if they may be replaced by individuals regardless of qualification or suitability. \nE. General Comments \nAs explained in Section II, OPM \nreceived more than 4,000 comments \nregarding this rulemaking whereby commenters provided useful insights into various aspects of these regulatory amendments. The comments below relate to general concepts regarding the civil service, civil service protections, and merit system principles that inform this rulemaking. In the following sections, OPM considers comments related to specific provisions of this final rule, the need for this rule, regulatory alternatives, and the costs and benefits of this rule. \nComments Regarding Why Civil \nServants Should Be Nonpartisan \nAs a baseline concept, many \ncommenters agreed with OPM that career civil servants should be nonpartisan. An association of administrative law judges cited Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 79, as saying \u2018\u2018[i]n the general course of human nature, a power over a man\u2019s subsistence amounts to a power over his will.\u2019\u2019 Comment 1042. The association argued that \u2018\u2018[t]he principles of merit service require the federal government to base hiring decisions upon experience and expertise, and serve to ensure a nonpartisan, expert federal workforce.\u2019\u2019 An individual commenter cited research that politicization of the civil service \u2018\u2018has significant consequences for the proper functioning of government.\u2019\u2019 Comment 1427. This research included that of David Lewis (2008) on increased politicization of OPM during the 1980s and the resulting ill effects. Commenter argued that this report shows that politicization had \u2018\u2018severe consequences for agency competence.\u2019\u2019 Experienced career professionals left the agency and it was hard to replace them. These developments, in turn, discouraged promising entry-level candidates from applying to work in the agency, which resulted in decreased morale and difficulty conducting long-term planning. By the 1990s, commenter argued, the agency had suffered reputational damage. See also Comments 46 (supporting nonpartisan career civil service with studies showing politicization undercuts Federal Government performance and economic growth); 2822 (noting that civil service laws \u2018\u2018emphasize responsibilities to the government, U.S. citizens, the Constitution, laws, and ethical principles\u2019\u2019 and not \u2018\u2018political agendas\u2019\u2019). One commenter suggested a reason for the differences in performance between neutral and politicized staff was that that \u2018\u2018career civil servants who perceive their agencies to be politicized are less likely to invest in training and more likely to leave the agency\u2019\u2019 thereby reducing long-term government expertise. Comment 2446. OPM appreciates these views and agrees that the career civil service should remain nonpartisan. \nCommenters further argued that the \nUnited States civil service is already more politicized than those of peer countries. A professor argued that, among those countries, the United States \u2018\u2018is an outlier in terms of its existing level of politicization.\u2019\u2019 Comment 50. This is because \u2018\u2018[w]e use about 4,000 political appointees to run the executive branch. Up to the top five layers of leadership in a department or agency can be appointees, a sharp \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25000 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n165140 S.

Commenter noted that this \npresents a problem when Presidents invariably struggle to fill these slots, leading to delays in appointments and vacancies in leadership. See also Comments 2186 (\u2018\u2018[T]he United States\u2019 executive branch is more politicized than our peers.\u2019\u2019 (citing 2007 OECD survey)), 3359 (\u2018\u2018Compared to other major democracies, the United States already maintains a higher number of political appointees.\u2019\u2019). \nConversely, some commenters argued \nthat career civil servants need more political alignment with an administration\u2019s policies to be more \u2018\u2018accountable\u2019\u2019 to the President. A former political appointee argued that a merit system \u2018\u2018is important only as far as it helps the government better serve the American people,\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018the American people are best served when the government is in the control of the President they chose to entrust with control over the Executive Branch.\u2019\u2019 Comment 50; see also Comment 3892 (\u2018\u2018The federal bureaucracy is not currently adequately or constitutionally accountable to the elected president.\u2019\u2019). As explained in later sections, executive branch employees are already tasked with executing the administration\u2019s policies and there is little evidence that further politicization improves government performance for the American people. Politicization is associated with poorer performance outcomes, as described below. \nSome commenters opposed to the rule \nasserted that the Constitution allows a president to closely control executive branch civil servants. A law school clinic argued that, \u2018\u2018as a general matter, the Constitution gives the president the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties,\u2019\u2019 because \u2018\u2018[w]ithout such power, the President could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3190. For this proposition, \ncommenter cited Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n165(quoting Free Enterprise \nFund).166Commenter cited general \nconcepts in these cases regarding independent agencies\u2014the CFPB in Seila Law and the SEC in Free Enterprise Fund\u2014which explore the specific removal protections of principal officers therein, and the constitutionality of multiple layers of removal protections, as supportive of commenter\u2019s propositions. But as explained above regarding Free Enterprise Fund and further in Section III(F), nothing in those holdings or their progeny conflict with this final rule regarding title 5 protections to the career civil service. Career employees, the vast majority of whom would not be considered inferior officers, are accountable through a supervisory chain that typically runs upwards through layers of political appointees. As the official ultimately responsible for the agency can generally be removed at the President\u2019s will, and as those officials are ultimately responsible for the performance management of their subordinates, accountability is maintained. The fact that accountability in the form of removal may involve certain processes for those employees covered by adverse action procedures and, in some cases, appeal rights, does not make those protections unconstitutional. \nSome commenters argued that a \nsubset of civil servants actively work against the policies of conservative administrations. A legal organization opposed to the rule asserted that \u2018\u2018[i]nsulating federal employees from removal and answerability emboldens political activists with the federal government to disrupt or delay Presidential initiatives.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2866; see also Comment 2652. Comment \n3156, an advocacy nonprofit organization, further contended that \u2018\u2018[a]ny authority civil servants purport to exercise derives its legitimacy from the election of the President, and any attempt by civil servants in the executive branch to undermine the lawful actions of a President are an attack on the Constitution and on democracy itself.\u2019\u2019 OPM does not agree that employing civil servants\u2014without consideration of their political views\u2014 thwarts the agenda of any President, and commenter\u2019s objections lack any well- founded support. Republican and Democratic administrations have achieved important policy goals with a nonpartisan career civil service whose members undoubtedly encompass a wide variety of personal political perspectives. One former civil servant explained that \u2018\u2018[t]he Reagan and later administrations successfully implemented new policy directions with the professional Civil Service.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3038. A legal nonprofit organization concurred and added that civil servants \u2018\u2018did not stop [the last Administration\u2019s] deregulatory efforts\u2019\u2019 and to the extent that regulatory agenda was significantly delayed, \u2018\u2018the best explanation is not left-wing civil servants\u2019 resistance to a conservative agenda.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2822. For example, in the first term of the \nGeorge W. Bush Administration, agencies helped to establish new and reimagined personnel systems for both the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense in response to the terrorist attacks on America on September 11, 2001.\n167 \nImplementing these systems required two sets of complex regulations promulgated jointly by OPM and each agency. Government attorneys then vigorously defended these programs against legal challenges in the Federal courts.\n168As noted in the 2003 edition \nof Biography of an Ideal, with respect to \nDHS: \nOPM successfully advocated the \nparamount importance of equipping the new \nDepartment with a modern human resources system that would make possible the flexible use of all aspects of the system as tools to help management accomplish strategic objectives and results. The legislation establishing DHS granted authority for the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of OPM to create, by jointly issued regulation after extensive employee involvement and consultation with stakeholders (such as unions, employee associations, academic experts, and executives in the corporate and nonprofit sectors), modern pay and job evaluation systems....\n169 \nThe career civil service fulfilled the \ntasks they were asked to perform to \nstand up these systems rapidly regardless of their personal politics or views. \nComments Regarding Nonpartisan \nCareer Civil Servants and Neutral Competence \nSeveral commenters supportive of this \nrule touted that a significant benefit of a nonpartisan career civil service is their \u2018\u2018neutral competence.\u2019\u2019 A former OMB official who joined the agency in 1980 commented that, \u2018\u2018[l]ike other OMB career staff, I was not primarily a Democrat or a Republican, but instead I strongly endorsed and practiced the ethos of \u2018neutral competence\u2019 that served the president, without regard to the party of the president.\u2019\u2019 Comment 13.

Making these \npositions political appointees would destroy institutional knowledge and result in crippling inefficiencies.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3758; see also Comments 659, 678, 1818 (touting \u2018\u2018value of the experience of those who have worked in [a policy] area and the need to insulate them from political pressures of a specific administration\u2019\u2019). A federal policy analyst commented \u2018\u2018I have worked closely and successfully with political appointees under the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations to issue regulations and policy guidance consistent with the policy priorities of those administrations.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3195. Commenter continued that \u2018\u2018[n]aturally, I have personal opinions about the policy work I do, and I sometimes disagree with my politically appointed leaders about specific policies or projects. In fact, robust civil service protections have empowered me\u2014and, collectively, my coworkers and other career employees\u2014to occasionally share policy recommendations or serious concerns with agency leadership, which sometimes results in leadership changing course.\u2019\u2019 Commenter concluded that this is a \u2018\u2018perfectly normal and healthy process, as career civil servants are supposed to provide candid deliberative advice to the politically appointed leaders which ultimately make the decisions....  A t  the same time, I and other career federal employees certainly understand that we are not decisionmakers. Elections in a democracy have consequences, and it is entirely appropriate for agencies to pursue the policy preferences of the elected President that appoints its leaders.\u2019\u2019 A former civil servant added \u2018\u2018[h]istory makes the case that stable societies with healthy economies rely on steady, capable administration. For security, for uninterrupted routine transactions and for predictable decisions and communication. When things work, unfortunately, few people notice.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3038. A 32-year civil servant described serving under six presidents\u2014three Republicans and three Democrats\u2014and working \u2018\u2018every day \ndevoted to serving the Constitution, the laws and regulations, [ ] agency missions and the American people.\u2019\u2019 Commenter asserted that \u2018\u2018our system thereby strikes an appropriate balance between presidential control and professional independence.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2371; see also Comments 2208 (33-year federal \nattorney who served under several administrations), 2258 (former HHS attorney who also served under several administrations). A few commenters opposed to the \nrule argued that career civil servants are \nnot politically neutral\u2014they instead seek to influence policy through politicized competence. Comment 3156 \nargued that contrary to the premise of OPM\u2019s rulemaking, career federal employees \u2018\u2018have strong views on policy and actively desire to shape it.\u2019\u2019 Commenter asserted that they offer \u2018\u2018politicized competence\u2019\u2019 instead of \u2018\u2018neutral competence.\u2019\u2019 An advocacy nonprofit organization commented that the federal civil service is not politically neutral because in the 2016 presidential election, for example, \u2018\u2018federal employee donations\u2014as recorded by the FEC\u2014 went 95 percent to the Democratic nominee for president.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3892. OPM recognizes that many federal civil servants have their own constitutionally protected political and policy preferences, which they are free to express subject to the requirements of the Hatch Act and other statutes and regulations. But even assuming commenter\u2019s beliefs about the policy and political preferences of civil servants are accurate, these comments do not convincingly tie a civil servant\u2019s personal beliefs to concrete and actionable unacceptable performance or misconduct. \nComment 4097, an advocacy \nnonprofit organization, tried to equate political misalignment with poor performance. Commenter argued that \u2018\u2018scholars virtually universally accept the fact that federal employees have their own policy views and often seek to advance them.\u2019\u2019 Commenter cites one article, Nou (2019),\n170for this \nproposition, but Nou\u2019s analysis is much more nuanced and measured. Nou\u2019s article is about hierarchical dynamics in government and she qualifies the findings as \u2018\u2018an initial exploration of the implication\u2019\u2019 of overt (not covert) civil servant disobedience. \u2018\u2018The aim is to . . . examine principles for normatively evaluating the practice.\u2019\u2019 The article\u2019s \u2018\u2018hope is to start, not end, more nuanced conversations\u2014to move past simplistic references to the \u2018deep state\u2019 or \u2018the resistance\u2019 towards a greater appreciation of the complexity of intra- executive branch dynamics.\u2019\u2019 Nou\u2019s preliminary conclusions are that \u2018\u2018[b]ureaucratic resistance, broadly defined, is neither exceptional nor unprecedented.\u2019\u2019 Nou contends that \u2018\u2018[e]ven the most ardent proponents of executive power may have to acknowledge that some forms of it are \ninevitable in hierarchies with imperfect information.\u2019\u2019 Nou also explains that it would be \u2018\u2018difficult, if not impossible, to verify empirically\u2019\u2019 whether bureaucratic resistance changed qualitatively under the previous Administration.\n171Nou\u2019s article\u2014 \nfocused on macro group dynamics\u2014 does not support commenter\u2019s proffer that it is universally understood that civil servants advance their own policy views instead of those of the administration or their agencies. \nComment 4097 continued, arguing \nthat \u2018\u2018[s]cholars find it very clear that bureaucrats are not neutral parties in the policymaking process. Rather, they have their own set of interests that they actively work to protect.\u2019\u2019 For this, commenter also cited one article, Potter (2017b).\n172But commenter\u2019s \nproposition does not align with Potter (2017b) nor with a related citation in the comment to Potter (2017a).\n173Potter \ndoes not examine the relationship between individual bureaucrats\u2019 political ideologies and the speed with which they act. Instead, she explains that \u2018\u2018[r]ules take a long time to complete\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018[b]ecause agencies make important\u2014and binding\u2014policy through rulemaking, political overseers keep a watchful eye over the process. Each branch of government\u2014the president, Congress, and the courts\u2014 plays a role in overseeing agency rulemaking.\u2019\u2019 Potter continues that, \u2018\u2018[w]hile each branch of government\u2019s authority over rulemaking is exercised \nin a different manner, the key insight here is that each branch has the power to overturn an agency rule or, at a minimum, raise the agency\u2019s cost of doing business.\u2019\u2019 Rule reversals and rebukes are significant setbacks with \u2018\u2018long-term consequences for agency reputations, autonomy, and bureaucrats\u2019 career trajectories.\u2019\u2019 Potter\u2019s thesis is that agencies can anticipate, and possibly stave off, some types of oversight by pacing their rules to line up with a favorable president, Congress, and/or courts. Potter finds that \u2018\u2018the pace of rules slows significantly when [any of these three] are more inclined to disagree with\u2014and potentially punish\u2014 the agency issuing the rule in \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25002 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n174Potter (2017b), supra note 172. \n175Potter (2017a), supra note 173, at p. 28. 176Citing David E.

Instead, Comment 4097 included a list of instances that allegedly show career employees withholding information from political appointees in the last Administration, refusing ideologically distasteful work, delaying and \u2018\u2018slow-walking\u2019\u2019 work, providing unacceptable work product, leaking information, and being insubordinate. For these points, the comment largely cited a separate publication by the author of the comment, Tales from the Swamp. As \ndescribed above, another commenter, Comment 2822, addressed and many of \nthese examples. \nIn sum, Comment 4097 pointed to \nselect articles and makes conclusions that the articles do not fully support and with which OPM does not agree. Still, commenter claimed OPM\u2019s rulemaking ignores whether \u2018\u2018federal employees may have their own goals and motivations or how they behave when their goals differ from the President\u2019s\u2019\u2019 but, as shown in the proposed rule and here, OPM has thoroughly examined this dynamic, as has Congress when it enacted civil service protections and merit system principles that include disciplinary mechanisms for when employees do engage in improper behavior. Indeed, it is Congress\u2019 views that are paramount, and this rule is in furtherance of the statutory scheme and protections that Congress enacted through the CSRA. \nComments Regarding the Benefits of a \nNonpartisan Civil Service \nMany commenters agreed with OPM \nthat career civil servants provide experience and expertise that benefit the country. For instance, Comments 148 and 686 described the work civil servants do to protect \u2018\u2018our legal system, our transportation networks, the safety of our food and drugs, our borders, our air and water, our farmlands, and so much more.\u2019\u2019 Several other commenters asserted that a professional and nonpartisan civil service bolsters legitimacy and public trust in government. As a result, the American public holds civil servants in higher esteem than elected officials and political officers. A former federal official argued that, while as of May 2022, \u2018\u2018trust in career employees at government agencies had declined from previous years, a majority of Americans still reported having a great deal or fair amount of confidence in career employees to act in the best interest of the public; substantially more Americans believe this about career employees than about political appointees.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2186; see also Comment 2814 (a research and advocacy nonprofit organization, arguing \u2018\u2018Americans tend to hold these public servants in relatively high esteem, recognizing their professionalism and independence\u2019\u2019 which \u2018\u2018contrasts particularly with Americans\u2019 views of elected officials and political officers.\u2019\u2019). The former federal official cited a study which found that \u2018\u2018emphasizing the technocratic expertise of agency officials, including that they could not be hired for their political views or fired for disagreements with political leaders,\u2019\u2019 resulted in a \u2018\u2018statistically significant . . . [increase] in legitimacy scores.\u2019\u2019 The study found smaller increases in perceived legitimacy from emphasizing public participation and found no increase in perceived legitimacy from emphasizing the responsiveness of the agency action to the President\u2019s priorities and White House staff. The study also cautioned that \u2018\u2018the conclusion that expertise and political insulation boost legitimacy has a converse: those desiring to erode public support for agencies ought to weaken the civil service.\u2019\u2019 This risks a negative feedback loop concerning agencies\u2019 legitimacy and civil-service protections (i.e., fewer protections lead \nto worse perceptions, which lead to fewer protections, and so on). \nRelatedly, commenters noted that \npolitical appointees are associated with lower program performance. A professor cited studies to this effect.\n176Comment \n50. The research found a \u2018\u2018negative relationship between political appointment status and program performance, while showing that appointees selected because of their campaign or party experience were especially likely to undermine \nperformance.\u2019\u2019\n177The professor also \ncited findings that \u2018\u2018[m]ore politicized environments undermine incentives for career bureaucrats to invest in their skills, and instead encourages them to look for work elsewhere.\u2019\u2019\n178This \nproposition is supported by other comments that discuss the potential effects of politicization on recruitment, \nhiring, and retention (see Section V.(B)). \nAnother professor noted that the \u2018\u2018consensus,\u2019\u2019 as \u2018\u2018evidenced by a large volume of peer reviewed research,\u2019\u2019 is that \u2018\u2018highly politicized bureaucracies are less transparent, less responsive and less accountable to the public, less conducive to stable governance, less capable of operating effectively, and more prone to corruption and clientelism than those with more neutral bureaucratic structures.\u2019\u2019 Comment 1927. \nThis view regarding the performance \nbenefits of career civil servants as compared to political appointees is not new. A few commenters pointed to a 1989 commission led by former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker proposing that the U.S. \u2018\u2018reduce the number of political appointees, pointing to the delays and performance problems associated with America\u2019s reliance on often inexperienced appointees.\u2019\u2019 See Comment 3973 (an anti-poverty nonprofit organization). A similar recommendation \u2018\u2018was made again in a 2003 report.\u2019\u2019 Id. \nData submitted by other commenters \nalso highlight the benefits of civil service protections and merit system principles on performance outcomes and reducing government corruption. A professor asserted that a recent \u2018\u2018systemic review of empirical research\u2019\u2019 on the use of merit-based processes across countries concluded that \u2018\u2018factors such as meritocratic appointments/ recruitment, tenure protection, impartiality, and professionalism are strongly associated with higher government performance and lower corruption.\u2019\u2019 Comment 50. A former federal official presented that \u2018\u2018a professional and independent civil service that is insulated from the whims of political appointees also has been shown to meaningfully reduce opportunities for corruption.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2816.

A former federal official cited one study that found that \u2018\u2018previous experience within an agency\u2019s bureau, and prior length of tenure, had significant positive impacts on program performance.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2186. While removing \u2018\u2018low performers who are hampering an agency\u2019s mission\u2019\u2019 is important, proposals that would \u2018\u2018facilitate rapid mass firings of experienced employees to suit a presidential administration\u2019s political agenda would likely impact the ability of agencies to preserve institutional knowledge and use it to improve agency operations over time.\u2019\u2019 Comment 1181, an individual, contended that research by political scientists Sean Gailmard and John Patty shows that the protections of the United States civil service system \u2018\u2018generate better outcomes because they allow public officials a time horizon and security to invest in task-specific expertise in public sector skills. Politicizing the workplace does the opposite.\u2019\u2019\n179Id.; see \nalso Comments 50, 1759 (professors \nciting the same research). This commenter wrote that recent research confirms this point, \u2018\u2018showing that more politicized environments undermine incentives for career bureaucrats to invest in their skills, and instead encourages them to look for work elsewhere.\u2019\u2019 Commenter concluded that, \u2018\u2018[s]ince much of federal employment work is technical in nature, and requires deep knowledge of programs, this makes both task-specific knowledge and institutional experience important, and impossible to easily replace.\u2019\u2019 \nComment 1427, an individual, cited \nJames Rauch (1995), who researched city governments during the Progressive Era and argued that lessons learned there can apply to the Federal Government. Rauch demonstrates that the \u2018\u2018institution of civil service protections was responsible for a greater focus on larger and longer-term infrastructure, which led to significantly increased economic development for cities with civil service protections over those without.\u2019\u2019 Commenter concluded that the same can be extrapolated to the Federal Government\u2014\u2018\u2018that civil \nservants with career protections will be able to focus on long-term projects with beneficial economic impact, rather than \nseeing their efforts driven only by their political patron.\u2019\u2019 \nComment 4097, an advocacy \nnonprofit organization, took issue with OPM\u2019s assertion, in the proposed rule, that there is little evidence showing that firing of career civil servants without appropriate process will improve the government\u2019s performance. In a footnote, commenter argued that performance between political appointees and career civil servants is not the relevant metric\u2014it should be \u2018\u2018how at-will career officials perform relative to tenured career officials.\u2019\u2019 Commenter then pointed again to \u2018\u2018state HR directors\u2019\u2019 who report that at-will employment \u2018\u2018is an essential modern management tool,\u2019\u2019 and that this rulemaking would deny federal agencies that \u2018\u2018tool.\u2019\u2019 \nIt is the Federal statutory scheme, as \ndemonstrated by Section 7511(b)(2), not OPM rulemaking, that is \u2018\u2018denying\u2019\u2019 Federal agencies this purported \u2018\u2018tool.\u2019\u2019 Through the CSRA, Congress chose to make removal protections the default for career employees, allowing only for limited exceptions. \nIn addition, commenter cited no data \nor studies demonstrating that at-will employees outperform \u2018\u2018tenured career officials\u2019\u2019 in state, let alone federal, agencies. Also, unless a civil servant, whose protections are governed by title 5, is in their probation/trial period or has not met the durational requirements under 5 U.S.C. 7511, they will generally\n180have adverse action \nprotections, as noted above. So the pool of at-will federal employees is difficult to gauge for a comparison. There is little doubt that at-will employment without initial procedures or back-end review makes firing easier, but that does not demonstrate that at-will employment produces better results. And although there is a legitimate purpose for a small cadre of Schedule C employees to act as confidantes and handle particularly sensitive tasks for presidential appointees, turning a large segment of the career staff\u2014who do not ordinarily function in that fashion\u2014into at-will employees would be an altogether different proposition and inconsistent with the historic trend of congressional enactments extending protections to larger segments of the workforce. \nMoreover, at-will civil servants would \nsuffer from the same deficiencies as political appointees under the studies cited above, in that they would lack the job stability that incentivizes \u2018\u2018invest[ing] in task-specific expertise in public sector skills.\u2019\u2019 See Comment \n1181. Also, as shown by Comment 2186, a former federal official, studies looking at state reforms leading to at-will employment found \u2018\u2018[o]ver 75 percent of state employees disagreed that the reforms \u2018had resulted in a state workforce that is now more productive and responsive to the public.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 For these reasons, Comment 4097 has not shown that hypothetical at-will federal employees would outperform career civil servants. \nCommenters supportive of the rule \nalso noted that career civil servants tend to be more moderate than political appointees. Comments 50, a professor, and 1227, an individual, cited research by Brian Feinstein and Abby K. Wood which looked at donation records and concluded that political appointees tend to be at ideological extremes on both the right and left, \u2018\u2018while career officials tend to be more moderate.\u2019\u2019\n181See also \nComment 2822 (legal nonprofit organization). \nA few commenters opposed to the \nrule argued that career civil servants are too partisan and skew left compared to the public. See Comment 1958 (an \nadvocacy nonprofit organization). Comment 3156, an advocacy nonprofit organization, examined donor information, and attempts to refute Comment 50\u2019s conclusions, above, by arguing that the federal workforce has \u2018\u2018self-politicized\u2019\u2019 and that the premise \u2018\u2018that civil servants are more moderate than political appointees\u2014no longer holds.\u2019\u2019 Whether or not there is probative value in examining donation differences between career civil servants and political appointees, no commenter established a connection between donation records or trends in donations to unacceptable performance by career civil servants. Federal workers are entitled to their political opinions and to support candidates on their free time (subject to the Hatch Act and other applicable laws). But they also must fulfill the duties of their positions appropriately or face an adverse action. \nComments Regarding the Nonpartisan \nCareer Civil Service\u2019s Support of Presidential Transitions \nVarious commenters supportive of the \nrule argued that career civil servants are important because they provide stability \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25004 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n182For example, the Guide published for the 2020 \nelection year is available at https://www.opm.gov/ \nabout-us/reports-publications/presidential- transition-guide-2020.pdf.

Comment 2511 contended that having in place an effective and knowledgeable career staff \u2018\u2018has proven to be a vital capability for new leaders after Inauguration Day\u2014especially as new Administrations seek solid footing and/or confront unexpected challenges.\u2019\u2019 Another former OMB employee added that \u2018\u2018the virtues of institutional memory, dedication to democratic governance principles, and professionalism evident at OMB are comparably shared at every federal department and agency.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2538. Career employees at OPM similarly play a significant role in advising incoming administrations as to options for filling critical positions during the first few days of the administration. OPM staff produce a Presidential Transition Guide to Federal Human Resources Management Matters that assists incoming leaders on this point.\n182 \nA public service nonprofit \norganization concurred, writing \u2018\u2018[c]areer employees allow a president to begin their administration by tapping into valuable institutional expertise that can help drive their agenda from day one, rather than starting from scratch.\u2019\u2019 Comment 44; see also Comment 46 (an individual). OPM agrees that civil servants are a valuable bridge across administrations, especially during the critical transition period. Our government, our democracy, and the American public rely on this smooth transition of power so that everything from the critical matters of the day to routine services are not stalled. \nBeyond the transition period, political \nappointees rely on career civil servants to carry out their policies and missions, commenters argued. Comment 1493, a \nformer political appointee, stated, \u2018\u2018I relied heavily on the experience, expertise, and advice of senior career civil service employees in evaluating and managing programs, developing policy and regulatory proposals, investigating and resolving cases, and otherwise administering the laws Congress has authorized those agencies \nto implement and enforce. I depended on those employees to provide advice and guidance based not on their allegiance to a particular politician or political party, but rather on their thorough understanding of the applicable statutes and regulations, their institutional knowledge of the history of the agencies, and their substantial technical expertise.\u2019\u2019 Even friction between political appointees and career civil servants has benefits. OPM received a comment from a former Schedule C political appointee who expressed \u2018\u2018[t]here was no problem accomplishing the agenda of the administration. In fact, the expertise and experience of the civil servants made it possible.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3522. Comment 2816, a former federal official, cited studies that found benefits to some \u2018\u2018friction between political agency heads and career staff\u2019\u2019 which \u2018\u2018have served to protect the public interest in a variety of ways.\u2019\u2019 For instance, these agencies \u2018\u2018tend to move more cautiously through rulemakings, utilizing less hurried rulemakings with particularly thorough records, with these rulemakings just as likely to produce final rules as in agencies with less internal conflict.\u2019\u2019 \nComments Regarding the American \nPublic and Government\u2019s Reliance Interests \nMany commenters agreed with OPM \nthat the American public relies on the nonpartisan civil service in all aspects of their lives. Comments 148 and 686 explained that these civil servants are \u2018\u2018hired via fair processes, are often paid less than their private sector counterparts, and are retained via the benefit of steady work and pride of service.\u2019\u2019 A private sector scientist described benefiting from the \u2018\u2018tremendous value provided by fellow scientists and engineers employed by our national agencies,\u2019\u2019 and from \u2018\u2018the countless more who contribute to a functioning society.\u2019\u2019 Comment 451. An individual described relying \u2018\u2018on multiple agencies\u2019\u2019 every day, from experts who protect consumers from fraudulent business practices to those \nwho manage the infrastructure and transportation needs of the country. Comment 1201. Commenter concluded that \u2018\u2018[a]llowing these workers to be fired for political reasons would be disastrous.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3641 (an individual) adds that politicization \u2018\u2018would be bad for individuals and businesses\u2019\u2019 because many companies rely on civil servants and their \u2018\u2018public data to make decisions.\u2019\u2019 \nSeveral others commented about the \nmany ways they and other Americans benefit from a nonpartisan career civil service. See Comments 136 (former air \ntraffic controller who served for 25 years), 817 (an economic researcher whose work \u2018\u2018relies heavily on the efforts of career civil servants across the Federal Government\u2019\u2019), 842 (adding that other nations also rely on the work of our federal agencies), 1155 (plant scientist and assistant professor who works closely with career employees at USDA), 1157 (former DOE, FWS, NPS, Forest Service, Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, EPA, and NOAA civil servant who was \u2018\u2018consistently impressed with the dedication, expertise, and professionalism of staff\u2019\u2019), 1299 (small business owner who works closely with federal agencies on climate change issues), 1518 (cancer researcher who relies on HHS science and NIH grants), 2082 (small business owner who relies on the \u2018\u2018stability of our government and its rules to conduct business\u2019\u2019). An individual argued that even high-level political officials, such as members of Congress and the President, \u2018\u2018rely on the advice, expertise, and execution capabilities of a professional civil service.\u2019\u2019 Comment 1047. By ensuring that the civil service is staffed by individuals chosen for their merit and \u2018\u2018protected from political winds, we ensure a more stable, effective, and reliable government.\u2019\u2019 Comment 1047 concluded that, \u2018\u2018[i]n essence, this rule isn\u2019t just about protecting jobs; it\u2019s about protecting the integrity of our government and the quality of our democracy. By ensuring that our civil service is merit-based, we are fostering an environment where the best and brightest can thrive, irrespective of the political climate.\u2019\u2019 \nMany nonprofit organizations \ncommented that Congress relies on a nonpartisan civil service to manage complex federal programs and therefore has an interest in legislating civil service protections and merit system principles. See Comments 2222, 2559, \n2620, 3095 (coalition of public interest organizations), 3149, 3687. They contended that Congress directly creates agencies, details agency authority, and sets policy goals for the agency to achieve using its authority, and \u2018\u2018may choose to grant an agency the authority to issue legislative rules, enforce provisions of law, or adjudicate claims.\u2019\u2019\n183They asserted that, while \n\u2018\u2018leaders in the executive branch may \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25005 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n184See Abby K Wood and David E Lewis, \n\u2018\u2018Agency Performance Challenges and Agency \nPoliticization,\u2019\u2019 Journal of Pub.

A legal nonprofit organization concluded that, while \u2018\u2018[s]ome critics argue that the role of civil servants is \u2018diligently following orders and implementing policies of elected officials,\u2019 or \u2018accomplishing the agenda of a president\u2019 rather than protecting \u2018the office of the president [or] their institutions,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 civil servants instead have \u2018\u2018responsibilities to the Constitution, to Congress, to the law, and to the American people. The critics\u2019 exclusive focus on implementation of a president\u2019s agenda misunderstands and distorts the structural role of our civil servants.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2822 (citations omitted). OPM agrees that Congress, as a co-equal branch of government, has a vested interest in a well-functioning federal workforce, especially since that workforce is tasked with carrying out the programs Congress authorizes. Congress plays an important role in legislating civil service protections, as it has done regularly since 1883. \nAnother concern of politicization \nexpressed by commenters is that it lowers responsiveness to the public and Congress. A professor cited research for this proposition.\n184Comment 50; see \nalso Comment 3687 (a science advocacy \norganization) (discussing the \u2018\u2018virtuous circle\u2019\u2019 of feedback from positive customer experiences leading to improved employee performance and back again). Commenter explained that, while \u2018\u2018Senate-confirmed appointees have been shown to be more reliable trustees of Congressional intent based on scrutiny in appointment, inserting thousands of unilateral appointments into the civil service would effectively impede Congress\u2019s ability to provide oversight.\u2019\u2019 \nCommenters cited data showing the \nmany benefits that federal civil servants provide to Americans across the country. Comment 44, a public service nonprofit organization, argued that the approximately 2.2 million civil servants are \u2018\u2018primarily located outside of the Washington DC region.\u2019\u2019 At least 80% of the federal workforce is located across the country as well as around the world. Commenter continued, \u2018\u2018[o]ur nation\u2019s federal employees deliver essential services including Social Security and Medicare benefits, assist small businesses, care for veterans, disrupt international criminal syndicates, maintain the safety of our transportation systems, protect the food supply, find cures for diseases, carry out the nation\u2019s foreign policy, and advance our national security.\u2019\u2019 OPM agrees that civil servants are fanned out across the country and the world, which allows them to be more responsive to constituents regarding the local and international functions of government. \nComments Regarding Regulated Entities\u2019 \nReliance Interests \nAnother benefit of a nonpartisan civil \nservice, many nonprofit organizations commented, is that they provide valuable certainty to regulated entities. See Comments 2222, 3095 (coalition of \npublic interest organizations), 3149, 3687, 3973. They argued that regulatory certainty provides \u2018\u2018a stable framework for regulated entities, partners, and federal grantees to understand their regulatory obligations and plan for the future, including across presidential administrations.\u2019\u2019 This predictability provides the \u2018\u2018certainty that these entities need to make investments, ensure compliance with legal requirements, and focus on delivering impact in their work rather than navigating uncertain and ever-changing \nlegal frameworks.\u2019\u2019 Further, \u2018\u2018stable regulatory frameworks advance values of uniformity and fairness.\u2019\u2019 By contrast, \u2018\u2018substantial turnover in federal staff in service of whipsaw changes to federal regulations can cause turmoil for partners and regulated entities.\u2019\u2019 They concluded that \u2018\u2018purges of agency staff are a poorly-tailored and excessively blunt tool for policy change, handicapping agencies\u2019 ability to actually develop and implement new policies while also potentially misdiagnosing barriers to policy change as personnel-related rather than legal, political, or practical.\u2019\u2019 OPM agrees with these commenters and their conclusions regarding benefits the nonpartisan civil service provides to regulated entities. \nComments Regarding Concerns About \nPoliticization of the Nonpartisan Civil Service \nOPM received several comments from \nindividuals concerned about a politicized civil service and the effects \nof politicization on them, their communities, and larger society. See Comments 80, 502, 1030. Comment 373, an individual, argued that the amount of \u2018\u2018institutional knowledge and training that would be lost if these roles ever became [politically] appointed would be unfathomable\u2019\u2019 and that the people that would be paying the cost from this constant churn would be ordinary citizens who rely on the \u2018\u2018daily affairs of government that no one ever thinks about.\u2019\u2019 An individual from Ohio stated that government employees account for a significant percentage of the workforce in that state. Comment 312. Commenter concluded that protecting the federal workforce \u2018\u2018is vital to protecting Ohio\u2019s economy.\u2019\u2019 Id. Comment 460, an \nindividual, concluded that the \u2018\u2018rule will reinforce public trust in our government institutions and ensure that civil servants can carry out their duties \nwithout undue political interference, thus maintaining the high standards of public service that our society expects and deserves.\u2019\u2019 \nOPM also received several comments \nfrom current and former civil servants who are concerned about improper political influence and removals. These included concerns like, \u2018\u2018[a]s a government employee, I have worked with both [Republican and Democrat] appointees. I have never feared for my job because of the civil service protections. My expertise is what I am paid for, not my political party.\u2019\u2019 Comment 470; see also Comments 60, 1991. An attorney and current civilian employee of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, expressed \u2018\u2018I have long planned to build my career primarily in public service. While not without its flaws, the minor miracle of the modern civil service system is a major motivating factor in my decision to pursue this career in public service and in particular to focus on the federal government.\u2019\u2019 Comment 1401. Commenter adds \u2018\u2018[t]he already- published plans\u2019\u2019 of some organizations to \u2018\u2018fundamentally alter or eviscerate the civil service system\u2014and ultimately to vitiate the concept of professionalism itself\u2014would, in the micro, certainly require me to rethink my own career and would, more broadly, drastically threaten the functioning of our United States government.\u2019\u2019 OPM received similar comments from a career employee in the Department of Defense (Comment 1349), a member of the Foreign Service (Comment 2320), a federal contractor (Comment 2338), and a contractor at the Office of Community \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25006 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n185See 5 U.S.C. 1103(a)(5)(A).

There are many things that don\u2019t work well in the American system, but our civil service is one of the few that does.\u2019\u2019 And Comment 2186, a former federal official, cited a 2005 report for the European Institute of Public Administration which argued that efforts to weaken state-level civil service protections had a \u2018\u2018tendency to punish state employees\u2019\u2019 with \u2018\u2018demoralizing \u2018bureaucrat bashing\u2019 rhetoric of the ideologically and politically driven reformers.\u2019\u2019 But there has been \u2018\u2018[g]rowing awareness among policy makers, public employees and their organizations, and human resource professionals that\u2019\u2019 state-level reforms to weaken civil service protections \u2018\u2018have not delivered the benefits they promised and may well dampen enthusiasm for [similar] initiatives by the states that contemplate sudden, wholesale, changes in existing arrangements.\u2019\u2019 \nF. OPM\u2019s Authority To Regulate \nThe OPM Director has direct statutory \nauthority to execute, administer, and \nenforce all civil service rules and regulations as well as the laws governing the civil service.\n185The \nDirector also has authorities Presidents have conferred on OPM pursuant to the President\u2019s statutory authority.\n186 \nAs explained here, in enacting the \nCSRA, Congress conveyed broad regulatory authority over Federal employment directly to OPM throughout title 5.\n187In addition, many \nof these specific statutory enactments, \nincluding chapter 75, expressly confer on OPM authority to regulate. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7514, OPM may issue regulations to carry out the purpose of subchapter II of chapter 75, and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7504, OPM may issue regulations to carry out the purpose of subchapter I of chapter 75. \nThe same is true with respect to \nchapter 43. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 4305, OPM may issue regulations to carry out subchapter I of chapter 43. \nPrior to the reorganization \nproposal\n188approved by Congress that \ncreated OPM, the CSC exercised its broad authorities, in part, to establish rules and procedures concerning the terms of being appointed in the competitive or excepted services and of moving between these services. Since its inception in 1978, OPM has used that same authority, as well as other statutory authorities such as 5 U.S.C. 1103(a)(5) and 5 U.S.C. 1302, to \nestablish rules and procedures concerning the effects on an employee of being appointed in, and of moving between, these services. OPM has used these authorities to create government- wide rules for Federal employees regarding a broad range of topics, such as hiring, promotion, performance assessment, pay, leave, political activity, retirement, and health benefits.\n189For \ninstance: \n\u20225 CFR part 6 requires OPM to \npublish in the Federal Register on a regular basis the list of positions that are in the excepted service.\n190 \n\u20225 CFR 212.401(b), promulgated in \n1968,191well before the CSRA, provides \nthat \u2018\u2018[a]n employee in the competitive service at the time his position is first listed under Schedule A, B, or C remains in the competitive service while he occupies that position.\u2019\u2019 This regulation, as discussed further in Section IV(A), was intended to preserve competitive service status and rights for employees who were initially appointed to positions in the competitive service \nand whose positions were subsequently moved involuntarily into the excepted service (such as administrative law judges).\n192 \n\u20225 CFR 302.102, promulgated in part \nto implement 5 U.S.C. 3320, provides that when an agency wishes to move an employee from a position in the competitive service to one in the excepted service, the agency must: \u2018\u2018(1) Inform the employee that, because the position is in the excepted service, it may not be filled by a competitive appointment, and that acceptance of the proposed appointment will take him/ her out of the competitive service while he/she occupies the position; and (2) Obtain from the employee a written statement that he/she understands he/ she is leaving the competitive service voluntarily to accept an appointment in the excepted service.\u2019\u2019\n193 \n\u20225 CFR part 432 sets forth the \nprocedures to be followed, if an agency opts to pursue a performance-based action against an employee under chapter 43 of title 5, U.S. Code. As with the adverse action rules in part 752, the rules applicable to performance-based actions apply broadly to employees in the competitive and excepted services, with specific exceptions that include political appointees.\n194 \n\u20225 CFR part 752 implements chapter \n75 of title 5, U.S. Code, and sets forth the procedural rights that apply when an agency commences the process for taking an adverse action against an \u2018\u2018employee,\u2019\u2019 as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7511. These regulations apply broadly to employees in the competitive and excepted services meeting the section 7511 criteria.\n195 \nMoreover, the President, pursuant to \nhis own authorities under the CSRA, as codified at 5 U.S.C. 3301 and 3302, has explicitly delegated a variety of these authorities to OPM concerning execution, administration, and enforcement of the competitive and excepted services. For example, under Civil Service Rule 6.1(a), \u2018\u2018OPM may except positions from the competitive service when it determines that . . . appointments thereto through competitive examination are not practicable.\u2019\u2019\n196And under Civil \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25007 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n1975 CFR 6.1(b). \n19886 FR 7231. 199561 U.S. at 506. 200Id.

Certain Members of Congress commented that these are \u2018\u2018critical regulatory updates that would continue the efforts of the Pendleton Act of 1883 and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\u2019\u2019 Comment 48, see also Comment 2134 (joint \ncomment by nonprofit organization and \nformer federal official, providing extensive background on this point, as summarized in Section IV). \nA few comments, like Comment 4097, \ncommented that OPM does not have the statutory authority to issue the regulatory amendments in this rule. OPM will discuss these arguments further in the following section because they relate to the specific amendments. See Sec. IV. \nComments Regarding the President\u2019s Constitutional Authority \nA few commenters argued that this \nrule would improperly restrict the powers of the President and is, therefore, unconstitutional. A former political appointee argued that the rule \u2018\u2018is an attempt to usurp Presidential authority by the bureaucrats in the Executive Branch sworn to serve the Constitution.\u2019\u2019 Comment 45. Comments 462 and 2012 (submitted by the same individual) argued that \u2018\u2018[a]ll employees of the Executive Branch serve at the sole discretion of the President and any laws, rules, regulations, or guidelines that restrict this discretionary power subvert the authority of the U.S. Constitution and as such are unconstitutional.\u2019\u2019 As described above, in Executive Order 14003, the President declared that \u2018\u2018[c]areer civil servants are the backbone of the Federal workforce, providing the expertise and experience necessary for the critical functioning of the Federal Government.\u2019\u2019\n198The \nPresident ordered that \u2018\u2018[i]t is the policy of the United States to protect, empower, and rebuild the career Federal workforce,\u2019\u2019 and that the Federal Government \u2018\u2018should serve as a model employer.\u2019\u2019 The Order described Executive Order 13957 (and Schedule F), as \u2018\u2018unnecessary to the conditions of \ngood administration,\u2019\u2019 and therefore revoked Executive Order 13957 because it \u2018\u2018undermined the foundations of the civil service and its merit system principles, which were essential\u2019\u2019 to the Pendleton Act\u2019s \u2018\u2018repudiation of the spoils system.\u2019\u2019 Far from usurping the President\u2019s authority, this rule effectuates the discretionary authority and policy positions of the President. \nAlso, while it is true that the \nPresident has broad and significant authority over the civil service, such as the power to create excepted service schedules when \u2018\u2018necessary\u2019\u2019 and when \u2018\u2018conditions of good administration warrant\u2019\u2019 or direct OPM to issue regulations, it is not the case that all employees of the Executive Branch serve \u2018\u2018at the sole discretion\u2019\u2019 of the President. This argument disregards 140 years of precedent and the role of Congress in shaping the civil service\u2014 which is tasked with executing Congressional programs\u2014as expressed most notably in the Pendleton Act, the Lloyd-La Follette Act, the CSRA, and other statutory changes designed to protect the civil service from actions contrary to merit. \nComments 2866, a legal organization, \nand 4097, an advocacy nonprofit organization, made a related argument that this final rule would violate Supreme Court precedent in Free Enterprise Fund, which the commenters argued \u2018\u2018held that the President has general authority to remove subordinates, and it is unconstitutional to shield inferior officers from Presidential control.\u2019\u2019 These comments suggest that OPM\u2019s construction in this final rule would \u2018\u2018give inferior officers with substantive policymaking or administrative authority binding removal protections.\u2019\u2019 As previewed in Section III(E), above, relating to a similar comment, nothing in this rule conflicts with Free Enterprise Fund or its progeny. \nFirst, these comments are mistaken in \ntheir assertion that \u2018\u2018many senior career officials are inferior officers.\u2019\u2019 OPM is not aware of any judicial decision \nholding so and the comments cite none. Instead, the comments cite Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent in Free Enterprise Fund, which listed several civil service \npositions that the dissent worried might be imperiled and subject to at-will removal under the majority\u2019s analysis. The majority, however, responded to Justice Breyer\u2019s concerns by explaining that \u2018\u2018none of the [civil service] positions [the dissent] identifies are similarly situated to the [PCAOB].\u2019\u2019\n199 The Court went on to clarify that \u2018\u2018many \ncivil servants within independent agencies would not qualify as \u2018Officers of the United States\u2019 \u2019\u2019 because they do not \u2018\u2018 \u2018exercise[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n200Neither the comments nor \nthe Free Enterprise dissent explained \nwhich, if any, civil service positions might exercise such \u2018\u2018significant authority,\u2019\u2019 or which are \u2018\u2018established by law.\u2019\u2019\n201That is not surprising, as even \nin 1879, ninety percent of the government\u2019s workforce was undoubtedly composed of employees rather than officers, and \u2018\u2018[t]he applicable proportion has of course increased dramatically since\u2019\u2019 then.\n202 \nSecond, inferior officer status, even \nwhere it applies, does not require employees to be at will. The Supreme \nCourt has consistently upheld for-cause and good-cause removal restrictions for inferior officers. Over 130 years ago, the Supreme Court held that Congress may constitutionally provide removal restrictions to inferior officers in the military. In United States v. Perkins,\n203 \nan inferior officer in the Navy challenged his removal without cause as unlawful, as Congress had provided that such inferior officers could be removed in peacetime only pursuant to a court- martial sentence.\n204The Supreme Court \nagreed, holding that it \u2018\u2018ha[d] no doubt\u2019\u2019 that Congress \u2018\u2018may limit and restrict the power of removal\u2019\u2019 for inferior officers.\n205 \nPerkins was consistent with the \ncontemporaneous judgment of both Congress and the President that merit- based appointments and removals from federal positions were in the Nation\u2019s interest. When Congress enacted the Pendleton Act, it provided for merit- based selection and prohibited removal based on partisan politics\n206and those \nremoval restrictions applied to inferior officers appointed by the President.\n207 \nPresident McKinley strengthened those removal restrictions by amending the Civil Service rules to prohibit removals \u2018\u2018except for just cause and upon written charges filed with the head of the department.\u2019\u2019\n208And Congress soon \nthereafter codified those restrictions to provide that \u2018\u2018no person\u2019\u2019 in the Civil \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25008 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n209Lloyd La-Follette Act, Public Law 62\u2013336, sec. \n6, 37 Stat. 539, 555 (1912). \n210141 S.

Service may be removed \u2018\u2018except for \nsuch cause as will promote the efficiency of said service.\u2019\u2019\n209 \nThose longstanding removal \nrestrictions constitutionally apply to inferior officers. In United States v. Arthrex, Inc.,\n210as discussed above, the \nSupreme Court explained that administrative patent judges can properly serve as inferior officers with restrictions on their removal, so long as their decisions are subject to review by a superior who is accountable to the President. Although the Federal court of appeals had invalidated the officers\u2019 removal restrictions,\n211the Supreme \nCourt reinstated them.212Arthrex is just \nanother decision confirming the principle that Congress may permissibly restrict removal of inferior officers, as it has for over a century. \nIndeed, the independent counsel in \nMorrison v. Olson,\n213constitutionally \nenjoyed a restriction on her removal except for \u2018\u2018good cause.\u2019\u2019\n214By statute, \nthe independent counsel had \u2018\u2018full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions and powers of the Department of Justice,\u2019\u2019 could conduct \u2018\u2018grand jury proceedings and other investigations,\u2019\u2019 could pursue \u2018\u2018civil and criminal\u2019\u2019 litigation, and could appeal any adverse court decisions.\n215The Supreme Court \nnonetheless held that the independent counsel was constitutionally subordinate to the Attorney General because, \u2018\u2018[m]ost importantly, the Attorney General retains the power to remove the counsel for \u2018good cause,\u2019 a power that we have already concluded provides the Executive with substantial ability to ensure that the laws are \u2018faithfully executed.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n216Accordingly, \nthe Court held that the independent counsel properly served as an inferior officer, and that the removal restriction \u2018\u2018does not violate the separation-of- powers.\u2019\u2019\n217And Free Enterprise Fund \nconfirmed that the holdings in Morrison and Perkins continue to stand for the \nproposition that Congress may enact certain \u2018\u2018restrictions on the power of principal executive officers\u2014themselves responsible to the President\u2014to remove their own inferiors.\u2019\u2019\n218 Third, these comments suggest that \ninferior officers within independent \nagencies cannot have any removal restrictions. Both the Trump and Biden Administrations, however, have consistently taken the position that inferior officers within independent agencies can constitutionally have removal restrictions.\n219As the Solicitor \nGeneral explained in 2018, when inferior officers within an independent agency can be removed for \u2018\u2018failure to perform adequately or to follow agency policies,\u2019\u2019 such removal restrictions \u2018\u2018afford[ ] a constitutionally sufficient degree of accountability and Executive Branch control.\u2019\u2019\n220 \nThe comments\u2019 comparisons of civil \nservice removal restrictions to those at issue in Free Enterprise Fund fail to describe the materially significant difference in degree of those restrictions. The inferior officers in Free Enterprise Fund could be removed only for willful violations of federal securities laws, willful abuse of authority, or failure to enforce compliance with the securities laws \u2018\u2018without reasonable justification or excuse.\u2019\u2019\n221Thus, the inferior officers of \nthe PCAOB could not be removed \u2018\u2018for violations of other laws,\u2019\u2019 and could not \nbe removed even if they were to \u2018\u2018cheat[ ] on [their] taxes.\u2019\u2019\n222Those \n\u2018\u2018rigorous\u2019\u2019 removal restrictions,223 \napplied to the Board\u2019s inferior officers, who had \u2018\u2018significant independence in determining [their] priorities and intervening in the affairs of regulated firms (and the lives of their associated persons) without . . . preapproval or direction\u2019\u2019 by any other officer.\n224By \ncontrast, members of the civil service can be removed for \u2018\u2018the efficiency of the service,\u2019\u2019\n225subject to the civil \nservice\u2019s prohibited personnel practices which, as a general matter, is both good policy and constitutional. And members of the civil service are overseen by other \nofficers within the Executive Branch, who can direct policy and approve or disapprove of their actions. The Court in Free Enterprise Fund noted that the removal provisions that apply to the more general civil service are substantially different from the stringent removal restrictions for the PCAOB, and the Court made clear that \u2018\u2018[n]othing in our opinion\u2019\u2019 should \u2018\u2018be read to cast doubt on the use of what is colloquially \nknown as the civil service system within independent agencies.\u2019\u2019\n226 \nOther commenters supportive of the \nrule argued that it in no way infringes on the President\u2019s legal authority. Comment 422, an individual, explained that \u2018\u2018the proposed rule does not eliminate the ability of the executive to, within the confines of legislation, execute policy decisions or discretion\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018the proposed provisions retain the distinction between the career civil service and political/excepted appointments, who retain their abilities to direct policy within the delegation of authority provided to by law.\u2019\u2019 As explained above, OPM agrees that the President has significant power over the civil service and this final rule does not infringe on those powers. Instead, it makes regulatory changes, in line with OPM\u2019s authorities (some conferred directly by Congress and others conferred by the President, by re- delegation of an authority conferred upon him by Congress) to clarify and reinforce statutory texts and advance the President\u2019s policy, as stated in Executive Order 14003, \u2018\u2018to protect, empower, and rebuild the career Federal workforce.\u2019\u2019 \nComments Regarding Regulatory \nJustifications \nSome commenters argued that the \nrule is procedurally unlawful because it is a pretext to block Schedule F. Comment 164, a form comment, stated that \u2018\u2018[t]he attempt to counter Schedule F through this rule amounts to a Deep State Protection Scheme that would \nundemocratically undermine to [sic] core constitutional principle that executive power is vested in the president.\u2019\u2019 Comment 101, another form comment, stated there is a \u2018\u2018discrepancy between the stated purpose of the rule and its actual intended purpose\u2019\u2019 which, the comment contends, is to prevent Schedule F. Comment 1958, an advocacy nonprofit organization, argued that \u2018\u2018[r]egulations are supposed to be responsive to specific problems. OPM\u2019s proposal is not an attempt to address an ongoing, active problem. Instead, it is a blatant defensive play\u2019\u2019 against Schedule F. Comments 2866, a legal organization, and 3156 argued that Department of Commerce v. New \nYork\n227held that the stated intent \nbehind the actions of executive agencies cannot be different from the agencies\u2019 actual motivation.\u2019\u2019 They also argue that \u2018\u2018OPM\u2019s stated intent of enhancing efficiency is demonstrably different \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00028 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25009 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n228See 88 FR 63862, 63867\u201369, 63874, 63878. \n229Id. at 63883. \n230See, e.g., Comment 2134, a joint comment by \na nonprofit organization and former federal official, \nat pp. 12\u201333. 231See, e.g., Garcia v.

Cir. 1996) (regarding voluntariness in the retirement context). from their actual motivation of \nimpeding future implementation of Schedule F to undermine future administrations.\u2019\u2019 \nAs explained extensively in the \nproposed rulemaking and in this final rule, OPM set forth a variety of reasons for promulgating this final rule. And, far from hiding concerns about Schedule F, the proposed rulemaking includes extensive discussion\n228about the prior \nSchedule F and OPM\u2019s view that its implementation would have constituted a stark and unwarranted departure from 140 years of civil service protections and merit system principles. The proposed rule and this final rule note that Schedule F sought to exploit the exception in section 7511(b)(2). As observed in the proposed rule\n229and by \nseveral commenters responding to that notice,\n230however, Congress, OPM, and \nother agencies had long understood the meaning of the phrase \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\u2019\u2019 to be a gloss on the description of positions that could be placed in Schedule C of the excepted service at 5 CFR 213.3301(a), i.e., \u2018\u2018positions of a confidential or \npolicy-nature.\u2019\u2019 In light of the issuance of Executive Order 13957, and its departures from the common understanding of the meaning of section 7511(b)(2), OPM determined to issue this rule. Among other reasons, the rule elucidates the proper scope of the exception in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) and clarifies any confusion that may have been introduced by the promulgation of the now-revoked order and schedule. \nOPM is authorized by Congress and \nthe President, throughout title 5, to regulate the civil service and carry out the purposes of the civil service statutes. OPM does not and cannot prevent a President from creating excepted service schedules or from moving employees, and this rule does not do that. Instead, the rule promulgates certain definitions clarifying the meaning of statutory language based on longstanding legislative history and intent, legal precedent, and past practices. \nIV. Regulatory Amendments and \nRelated Comments \nIn this section, OPM discusses the \nregulatory amendments to 5 CFR parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, and 752 and related comments. The first subsection discusses the retention of status and civil service protections upon an involuntary move to or within the \nexcepted service (revisions to parts 212 and 752). The second discusses the definition for positions of a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 character as used in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) (revisions to parts 210, 213, 302, 432, 451, and 752). And the third discusses processes for moving employees and positions to or within the excepted service and related appeal rights (revisions to part 302). \nA. Retention of Status and Civil Service \nProtections Upon a Move \nOPM amends 5 CFR part 752 (Adverse \nActions) to reflect OPM\u2019s longstanding interpretation of 5 U.S.C. 7501 and 7511 and the congressional intent underlying the statutes, including exceptions to civil service protections outlined in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b). These amendments clarify that \u2018\u2018employees,\u2019\u2019 under 5 U.S.C. 7501, 7511(a), in the competitive service or excepted service will retain the rights previously accrued upon an involuntary move from the competitive service to the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another, or any subsequent involuntary move, unless the employee relinquishes such rights or status by voluntarily encumbering a position that explicitly results in a loss of, or different, rights. The rule also conforms the regulation for non-appealable adverse actions with statutory language in 5 U.S.C. 7501 and Federal Circuit precedent to clarify which employees are covered. OPM amends 5 CFR part 212 (Competitive Service and Competitive Status) to further clarify a competitive service employee\u2019s status in the event the employee and/or their position is moved involuntarily to Schedules A, B, C, or any schedule created after the promulgation of this rule. \nA voluntary movement is generally \ncharacterized by an employee initiating a reassignment, conversion, or transfer by pursuing and accepting an offer to \nserve in a different position, either at the employee\u2019s own agency or another Federal agency. A voluntary move may extinguish accrued rights, depending on the circumstances of each such situation.\n231If, on the other hand, an \nagency initiates an action to move the employee\u2019s position from the competitive service to the excepted service or from one schedule in the excepted service to another, based on the nature of the position, that \nmovement will be regarded as involuntary, vis a vis the incumbent, and should not affect previously accrued rights. Similarly, if an employee is reassigned to a different position by the agency, on the agency\u2019s own initiative, to better meet agency needs, the reassignment or conversion will be regarded as involuntary and should not affect previously accrued rights. \nAs noted above in Section III(B), \nadverse action protections and related eligibility and procedures are covered in 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. Subchapter I covers suspensions for 14 days or less and 5 U.S.C. 7501 defines \u2018\u2018employee\u2019\u2019 for the purposes of adverse action procedures for suspensions of this duration. Under 5 U.S.C. 7504, OPM may prescribe regulations to carry out the purpose of subchapter I. Subchapter II covers removals, suspensions for more than 14 days, reductions in grade or pay, or furloughs for 30 days or less. In subchapter II, 5 U.S.C. 7511 defines \u2018\u2018employee\u2019\u2019 for the purposes of entitlement to adverse action procedures. Under 5 U.S.C. 7514, OPM may prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of subchapter II except as it concerns any matter where the MSPB may prescribe regulations. \nPerformance-based actions under \nchapter 43 and related eligibility and processes are covered in 5 U.S.C. 4303. Section 4303(e) defines when an employee is entitled to appeal rights to the MSPB. Chapter 43 cross-references \nchapter 75, providing that any employee who is a preference eligible, in the competitive service, or covered by subchapter II of chapter 75, and who has been reduced in grade or removed under section 4303, is entitled to appeal the action to the MSPB under 5 U.S.C. 7701. Under 5 U.S.C. 4305, OPM may issue regulations to carry out subchapter I of chapter 43. \nOPM received several overarching \ncomments regarding the proposed changes to Parts 212 and 752. OPM will discuss these comments, followed by specific comments related to these regulatory changes. \nComment Regarding the History of \nStatus and Rights Upon an Involuntary Move \nA joint comment from a nonprofit \norganization and a former federal official provided an extensive history of retention of accrued status and civil service protections upon the involuntary movement to an excepted service schedule or within the excepted service and agreed with OPM that this rulemaking would reinforce and clarify the longstanding legal interpretations \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25010 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n232215 F.2d 500 (D.C.

See Comment 2134. \nCommenter concluded that OPM\u2019s proposed regulatory provisions on retention are a clarification, rather than an expansion, of rights. Because of its thorough citation to facts and sources relevant to these regulatory changes, \nOPM will summarize portions of the comment here. \nCommenter began the analysis with a \ndetailed historical treatment of status and civil service protections and then turned to Roth v. Brownell,\n232a key \nprecedent on this issue, and its progeny. \nCommenter detailed that, before Roth, \nthe enactment of the Veterans Preference Act of 1944 enhanced the civil service rights of preference eligible employees. Consistent with the Ramspeck Act of 1940 and applicable executive orders,\n233the CSC\u2019s \nregulations at the time acknowledged that some employees in excepted service positions enjoyed competitive status. \nCommenter noted that, in 1950, the \nUnited States Court of Claims reviewed the CSC\u2019s regulations applicable to nonveterans and explained that \u2018\u2018employees serving under other than a probational or temporary appointment in the competitive service, and employees having a competitive status who occupy positions in Schedule A and B, shall not be removed or demoted except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service and in accordance with set procedures.\u2019\u2019 (emphasis in original).\n234 \nIn 1953, President Eisenhower created \nSchedule C in Executive Order 10440, which purported to strip employees, \u2018\u2018[e]xcept as may be required by the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act,\u2019\u2019 of accrued procedural protections upon their movement to Schedule C.\n235President Eisenhower then issued Executive Order \n10463, which purported to remove accrued procedural protections from employees in Schedule A, as well. An unfavorable decision in Roth v. \nBrownell would later lead President \nEisenhower to revoke and replace both executive orders. \nCommenter explained that, in Roth, \nthe D.C. Circuit considered a decision by Attorney General Herbert Brownell to challenge these civil service protections. Though plaintiff, Roth, had been appointed to the competitive service under the Ramspeck Act and President Roosevelt\u2019s 1941 Executive Order, a 1947 order by President Truman moved his position to a reestablished Schedule A. In 1953, the EisenhowerAdministration moved his Schedule Aposition to Schedule C and purported toremove his civil service status andprocedural protections. The ExecutiveDirector of the CSC had stated in a letterto Roth that career employees whosejobs were moved to Schedule C retainedtheir civil service protections. The D.C.Circuit ruled for plaintiff and orderedhis reinstatement. The court held thatneither of these moves stripped Roth ofthe competitive status and protectionshe had accrued, explaining that \u2018\u2018[t]hepower of Congress thus to limit thePresident\u2019s otherwise plenary controlover appointments and removals isclear,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018[i]t is immaterial here thatthe President has long been \u2018authorizedto prescribe such regulations for theadmission of persons into the civilservice of the United States as may bestpromote the efficiency thereof . . .[because] [c]omplete control overadmissions does not obviate the removalrequirements of the Lloyd-La FolletteAct.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n236\nCommenter explained that, a month \nafter the Roth decision, President \nEisenhower issued Executive Order 10577, revoking Executive Orders 10440 and 10463.\n237The new Executive Order \nprovided that \u2018\u2018an employee who is in the competitive service at the time his position is first listed under Schedule A, B, or C shall be considered as continuing in the competitive service as long as he continues to occupy such position.\u2019\u2019 In January 1955, the CSC issued new guidance consistent with the court\u2019s order in Roth and Executive \nOrder 10577, redefining for Federal \nagencies the coverage of the competitive civil service and the removal protection \nof certain Federal employees under the Lloyd-La Follette Act. The CSC explained that an employee who is serving with competitive status in a competitive position at the time his position is listed under Schedules A, B, or C, continues to be in the competitive service during his occupancy of that position (thus the employee is entitled to the removal protection of the Lloyd- La Follette Act, which applies to the competitive civil service). The CSC also explained that, where proposed appointees to a Schedule A, B, or C position are serving in the competitive service, the employees shall not be appointed until they are advised in writing that acceptance of the excepted appointment will result in their leaving the competitive service. This will put the employees clearly on notice that, upon acceptance of the excepted position, they will no longer be under the protection of the Lloyd-La Follette Act.\n238A few days after this issuance, \nthe CSC published a Federal Register notice to codify the Eisenhower Administration\u2019s recognition of these rights.\n239 \nIn giving its instructions to agencies \nabout movement of employees after January 23, 1955, to Schedule A, B, or C positions, the CSC also took steps to protect employees who were moved prior to that time. It stated that employees in three groups who were moved prior to January 23, 1955, would still be considered to be in the competitive service.\n240 \nCommenter showed that \ncontemporaneous legal analyses, such as a 1955 law review article, concluded that Roth had confirmed the durability \nof personally accrued status, at least in the case of an involuntary move.\n241That \nsame year, the Comptroller General demonstrated the broad applicability of Roth by confirming the appropriateness \nof the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s award of backpay to a similarly situated \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00030 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25011 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n242Citing Gov.

Leaving the competitive service would result in his giving up the job-removal protections of the Lloyd La Follette Act.\u2019\u2019 On the other hand, \u2018\u2018if an occupied job in the competitive civil service is moved to Schedule C, an incumbent who has civil-service status continues to have the removal protection of the Lloyd-La Follette Act during his occupancy of the position.\u2019\u2019\n243 \nAs commenter demonstrated, the next \nseveral presidential administrations did not differ in their interpretation regarding the retention of status and rights. Under President Lyndon Johnson, for example, the CSC codified the principle of retained status at 5 CFR 212.401(b).\n244OPM notes that this \nregulation remained unchanged until this final rule, which, consistent with the intent of the original regulation, modifies the regulation to cover any newly created schedules. \nUnder President Ford, the CSC \nacknowledged the continuing relevance of Roth in a memorandum emphasizing \nthat employees retained accrued status and civil service protections upon movement to positions designated as confidential or policy-determining.\n245A \nrelated handout for officials with presidential transition responsibilities explained that Schedule C employees with status were entitled to appeal their removal to the CSC under the commission\u2019s regulations at 5 CFR part 752.\n246 Still further, a decade after enactment \nof the CSRA, and during the Reagan \nAdministration, OPM issued a government-wide advisory that cited Roth as establishing the guiding \nprinciple for removing employees with status from Schedule C positions, explaining that an employee who was serving in a position in the competitive service when OPM authorized its conversion to Schedule C and who is still serving in that position may be removed from that position only \u2018\u2018for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service\u2019\u2019 and in accordance with the procedures established by 5 U.S.C. 7511 et seq. and part 752 of OPM\u2019s regulations.\n247 \nCommenter also referenced \nsubsequent cases and administrative opinions where this reasoning prevailed. For instance, in Saltzman v. \nUnited States,\n248the Court of Claims \nheld that the plaintiff, despite occupying a position that was now in the excepted service, was entitled to the civil service protections afforded to competitive service employees, explaining that \u2018\u2018Plaintiff never lost the rights he acquired under the Lloyd La Follette Act when he acquired permanent competitive status in the classified civil service.\u2019\u2019 \nCommenter then discussed Stanley v. \nDepartment of Justice,\n249where the \nFederal Circuit reviewed the adverse action rights of term-limited Bankruptcy Trustees who were moved into Schedule C because they were proclaimed to be encumbering positions that were \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- advocating\u2019\u2019 in character. As explained below in response to another contention in Comment 4097, this 2005 ruling was entirely consistent with the longstanding view that an employee cannot be stripped of status involuntarily but can waive it voluntarily. \nAnalogous principles apply to \nemployees subject to transfers of functions.\n250In 1980, for instance, the \nComptroller General agreed with OPM guidance determining \u2018\u2018that employees who transfer to the Peace Corps would be transferred incident to a transfer of functions and accordingly would retain their status as employees with competitive civil service appointments \nnotwithstanding that the Peace Corps\u2019 appointment authority is solely under the Foreign Service Act of 1946 as amended.\u2019\u2019\n251 \nFurther, the MSPB has held that a \ndetermination under 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) is not adequate unless it is made before the employee is appointed to the position.\n252The MSPB has also required \nagencies to follow applicable procedures when making determinations under 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2). In Blalock v. Department of \nAgriculture,\n253for example, the MSPB \nrejected an agency\u2019s claim that it had removed employees from their Schedule A positions by reduction-in-force (RIF) procedures and appointed them to new Schedule C positions. It found that this RIF was improper and the redesignation was not a \u2018\u2018reorganization.\u2019\u2019 Therefore, the agency could not have conducted a RIF and the agency\u2019s abolishment of their Schedule A positions constituted individual adverse actions against the incumbents. The MSPB directed the agency to reinstate preference eligible employees whom it had separated without adhering to applicable adverse action procedures. \nOPM appreciates Comment 2134 \nproviding such extensive and detailed factual history and agrees with the comment\u2019s analyses and conclusion that \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25012 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n254See 88 FR 63862, 63865\u201366, 63877. 255470 U.S. at 541. \n256See, e.g., id.; Correa-Ruiz v.

See Comments 41. \nCommenters supportive of the rule \nargued that the President cannot take away a vested property right through an executive order. The same coalition of national and local labor unions wrote that no President, through an \u2018\u2018Executive Order or other action can override the Constitution or Chapter 75\u2019\u2019 and remove the property interest that certain career employees accrue in their continued federal employment. See Comment 41. A former federal official argued that OPM\u2019s rulemaking regarding part 752 would help protect career civil servants against \u2018\u2018arbitrary adverse actions while serving in their positions\u2019\u2019 \nand would help preserve those employees\u2019 protections even when a competitive service position is moved into the excepted service. See Comment \n2816. Commenter continued that this rule would reduce the risk of misapplying the civil service statutes by using rescheduling to bypass civil service protections. OPM agrees with the contention regarding property rights and the expected benefits of this rule. \nA commenter opposed to the rule \nargued that the President can use rescheduling to eliminate civil service protections. Comment 4097 conceded that OPM accurately explains in the proposed rule that the Supreme Court has held that civil service protections give government employees a property interest in their job, and that those same cases also state that the government cannot constitutionally remove these property interests without due process. Commenter contended, nevertheless, that the government can eliminate civil service procedures and, in doing so, extinguish the underlying property interest previously created. The cases and examples commenter cited in support (see Comment 4097, fn. 8), \nhowever, involve state legislative action, not executive action, to alter or remove civil service protections. This appears to be in line with Loudermill which \ninstructs that a \u2018\u2018legislature may elect not to confer a property interest in public employment, [but] it may not constitutionally authorize the deprivation of such an interest once conferred, without appropriate procedural safeguards.\u2019\u2019\n255Federal \nappellate courts have held that rights conferred on state employees by legislative action can be revoked, but that revocation also requires legislative action.\n256Also, it is unclear which, if \nany, cited cases removed protections from incumbents as opposed to unencumbered positions, which could run contrary to Roth and its progeny as \nexplained above. \nCommenter also argued that, in light \nof section 7511(b)(2), courts have held that federal agencies can declare positions policy-influencing and thereby eliminate civil service removal requirements that previously attached, citing Stanley v. Department of \nJustice\n257and Stanley v. Gonzales.258 \nOPM disagrees with commenter\u2019s characterization of these two cases, in which the Federal and Ninth Circuits heard challenges to the removal of two U.S. Trustees who were serving five- year terms. The original text of the statutory provision concerning U.S. Trustees, 28 U.S.C. 581, provided that the Attorney General could remove a U.S. Trustee only for cause.\n259In 1986, \nhowever, Congress amended the statute to eliminate the \u2018\u2018for cause\u2019\u2019 requirement.\n260At the time the trustees \nwere initially appointed, no Attorney General had made a determination that the position should be considered confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating. Later, however, Attorney General Janet Reno declared U.S. Trustee positions to be \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 in character, and therefore not subject to chapter 75\u2019s protections.\n261Several \nyears later, Attorney General John \nAshcroft fired the Trustees.262 \nCommenter argued that the \u2018\u2018courts upheld these dismissals because the trustees now occupied policy- influencing positions; they no longer had MSPB appeal rights.\u2019\u2019 But this glosses over the actual facts of these cases. As noted by Comment 2134, and as explained in Stanley v. Department \nof Justice, even though Attorney General Reno made this determination, the Department of Justice acknowledged in writing \u2018\u2018that Trustees appointed prior to the proclamation would not be affected\u2014they would retain appeal rights\u2014but that all those appointed after the proclamation were exempt from the due process provisions contained in Title 5.\u2019\u2019\n263And these appointments \nwere subject to a term of five years. Accordingly, any rights in the original appointment would have ended at the end of that term. The initial five-year terms of these two Trustees later expired. When the individuals affected voluntarily accepted new appointments \nto subsequent five-year terms, those appointments were now subject to Attorney General Reno\u2019s intervening determination that the positions were confidential, policy-determining, policy-influencing, or policy- advocating. During the Trustees\u2019 second five-year term, a new presidential administration removed them. The Federal Circuit found that the intervening determination by Attorney General Reno, before their voluntary \nacceptance of a second term, deprived them of any entitlement to particular procedures before they could be terminated from the positions. \nThus, far from demonstrating that \n\u2018\u2018courts have held that federal agencies can declare positions policy-influencing and thereby eliminate civil service removal requirements that previously attached,\u2019\u2019 Stanley v. Department of \nJustice demonstrates only that when \nCongress excepts a position from the competitive service by statute and confers authority on the agency head to remove without cause, and when the agency head thereafter determines that the position is policy-influencing, the subjects of new appointments thereafter will not be entitled to procedural or appeal rights under chapter 75 and 5 U.S.C. 7701. \nReliance upon the related Stanley v. \nGonzales case also does not support \ncommenter\u2019s position. In that case, the Ninth Circuit affirmed a holding by a \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25013 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n264See 88 FR 63862, 63869. Federal district court that that court \nlacked jurisdiction over Ms. Stanley\u2019s new constitutional claims arising from the same facts. Although Ms. Stanley argued that the CSRA did not preclude her from pursuing relief directly under the Constitution, the Ninth Circuit concluded that it could not even reach that question because she had failed to allege a colorable constitutional claim. More specifically, in concluding she could not state a cognizable property interest in her position, the Ninth Circuit focused on the key details that Stanley was on a time-limited second appointment and that, by statute (citing 28 U.S.C. 581), she could be removed without cause by the Attorney General. \nThere is nothing about these decisions \nthat is inconsistent with OPM\u2019s position that a career employee\u2019s accrued rights cannot be stripped involuntarily. \nA former political appointee opposed \nto the rule argued that OPM claimed it is acting in accordance with statutory text, legislative history for that text, and Congressional intent but there is nothing in the CSRA that states congressional intent to preserve rights upon a move. See Comment 45. \nCommenter argued that OPM\u2019s rulemaking is speculative with regard to the intent of the statutes, especially \u2018\u2018since neither 5 U.S.C. 7501 nor 5 U.S.C. 7511 clearly state their intents\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018neither statute talks about or insinuates \u2018congressional intent.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 It is unclear what this commenter is attempting to convey. The language in chapter 75 does not provide an explicit definition for certain terms used therein. OPM notes, however, that congressional intent is not always spelled out in statutory text, especially in a comprehensive statute that deals with many discrete topics. In that situation, courts, regulated entities, and others seeking to interpret statutory language may look to traditional tools of statutory interpretation, including structure, statutory and legislative history and other indicia of intent, as well as relevant precedents. As explained throughout this final rule, these statutes have extensive statutory and legislative history and there are precedents that support OPM\u2019s rulemaking. The extensive history discussed in Comment 2134, for example, supports OPM\u2019s rule \nregarding the retention of status and rights upon an involuntary move. \nA nonprofit organization opposed to \nthe rule commented that 5 U.S.C. 7501 and 7511 refer to current continuous service in a same or similar position, but do not contemplate a move from the competitive service to the excepted service. See Comment 1811. The \norganization asserted that OPM offers no case law \u2018\u2018relevant to this specific \ninstance\u2019\u2019 and because \u2018\u2018the current regulations do not address this particular situation,\u2019\u2019 commenter believes rulemaking \u2018\u2018is not the proper way for OPM to address this concern.\u2019\u2019 Instead, \u2018\u2018Congress ought to clarify worker protection here.\u2019\u2019 The reference to current continuous service relates to how rights are accrued in the first place. Once an employee has accrued the requisite service, different considerations apply with respect to the consequences of an involuntary move of a position or person from the competitive to the excepted service. A different advocacy nonprofit organization stated that \u2018\u2018OPM does not have the authority to permanently attach removal protections.\u2019\u2019 See Comment 1958. Moreover, commenter argued that \u2018\u2018worker classifications exist to tie different levels of protection to different types of jobs.\u2019\u2019 Allowing a worker to carry over a protection to a new classification \u2018\u2018undercuts the purpose of worker classifications.\u2019\u2019 Commenter argued that this \u2018\u2018provision is a significant change in law, not a mere clarification[.]\u2019\u2019 \nOPM will make no revisions based \nupon these comments. As explained previously, Roth held that once a \nFederal employee has accrued civil service status and procedural rights, the employee retains the status and rights even if the employee\u2019s position is later moved to an excepted service schedule that would otherwise lack such status and rights. Roth was consistent with the \ncases that followed, such as Loudermill and its progeny, which OPM describes here and in the proposed rulemaking. In the absence of specific examples, we are unaware what commenter means by \u2018\u2018different levels of protection\u2019\u2019 for \u2018\u2018different types of jobs.\u2019\u2019 An \u2018\u2018employee\u2019\u2019 as defined in section 7511, who has met the requisite service requirement, is entitled to the procedures specified in section 7513, whether the employee is in the competitive service or the career excepted service. \nA nonprofit organization opposed to \nthe rule commented that employees moved from the competitive service to the excepted service should not as a matter of policy retain their accrued rights. Comment 1811. Commenter asserted that the changes to part 752 would make terminations harder for agencies by strengthening civil service protections. OPM notes that these revisions largely clarify the status quo so they would not make it more difficult to remove employees for the efficiency \nof the service or pursuant to the optional procedures in chapter 43 for action based on unacceptable \nperformance. Section 212.401(b) of this part, promulgated in 1968, already provides that \u2018\u2018[a]n employee in the competitive service at the time his position is first listed under Schedule A, B, or C remains in the competitive service while he occupies that position.\u2019\u2019 As noted in the proposed rule,\n264this regulation was intended to \npreserve civil service protections and adverse action rights when positions are moved. Comment 1811 then argued that \u2018\u2018[w]hen employees move from the Competitive Service to the Excepted Service, it is not logical that their accrued worker protections should follow them. They will report to new supervisors, have new work, and different responsibilities.\u2019\u2019 For the reasons described above regarding Comment 2134 and its analysis of Roth and its progeny, OPM disagrees that such retention of rights is illogical. On the contrary, it is well grounded in decades of civil service precedent and practice. Without these protections, an agency might try to defeat accrued rights by reassigning individuals to new positions in another service or schedule. Although we believe the case law would already make such an attempt futile, we have chosen to clarify our regulations by addressing the consequences of such a move explicitly in this final rule. Moreover, there is nothing to support the contention that moving an employee to the excepted service would necessarily result in new supervisors, new work, or different responsibilities. \nComments Regarding the Regulatory \nChanges and Creation of \u2018\u2018New Rights\u2019\u2019 \nTwo commenters opposed to this rule \nargued that it grants new rights that are contrary to statute. One former political appointee argued that \u2018\u2018Congress has distinguished between the competitive service and exempted [sic] service\u2019\u2019 in that they are different classifications with different hiring processes, responsibilities, and protections. Comment 45. Commenter continued that it \u2018\u2018is unfair that civil servants who have worked in the exempted [sic] service for years would not have protections, while those who had just been moved from the competitive service would have protections, solely by virtue of their previous classification.\u2019\u2019 We assume, for purposes of responding to this comment, that commenter meant to refer to the excepted service, as there is no \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00033 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25014 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n265The confusion may arise from section \n302.101(c) of this part, which lists a small set of \npositions in the excepted service that are also exempt from the part 302 procedures that would normally apply to the hiring of employees into the excepted service. As noted above, section 3320 of title 5, U.S. Code, requires appointing authorities hiring individuals into the excepted service to use the same procedures described in sections 3308 to 3318 of title 5 to effectuate veterans\u2019 preference. OPM\u2019s regulations at part 302 are intended to provide the means for an agency to meet that requirement. Part 302 provides for limited exemptions where compliance is essentially impossible (e.g., attorney positions, for which \nCongress has forbidden examination in annual appropriation provisions). For those discrete positions, veterans\u2019 preference must still be applied as far as administratively feasible. 5 CFR 302.101(c). \n266See Civil Service Due Process Amendments \nAct, 101 Public Law 376 (Aug. 17, 1990). \n267We also note that section 7511(b)(2) does not \nautomatically exempt policy-influencing General \nSchedule positions from chapter 75 protections. The position must be placed in the excepted service by the President, OPM, or Congress, and a determination must be made, by the appropriate person or entity, as described in more detailed subparagraphs under subparagraph (b)(2), that the position is of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. The provision is not self-executing, as the Stanley cases \ndemonstrate. In the absence of a determination by the appropriate party, and communicated at the \ntime of appointment, section 7511(b)(2) would not limit adverse action rights. \n268See 88 FR 63862, 63871. 269See 5 U.S.C. 7501, 7511. \n270See 5 CFR 302.102 (regarding processes for \nvoluntary movements). \u2018\u2018exempted service\u2019\u2019 category.265 \nCommenter appears to suggest that \nexcepted service employees do not have civil service protections. Excepted service positions may accrue the same adverse action rights as competitive service employees once they satisfactorily complete their probationary/trial period or satisfy their durational requirement. See 5 U.S.C. \n7511. Following a decade of experience under the CSRA, Congress expanded the \nscope of employees covered by adverse action procedures in the 1990 Amendments by conferring such rights on employees who had been appointed to career excepted service positions and had accrued 2 years of continuous service in the same or a similar position.\n266The main exception to this, \nas discussed throughout this rule, are those excluded under 5 U.S.C. 7511(b), including political appointments \nrequiring senate confirmation, Schedule C political appointees, and presidential appointments. Also, as explained previously, for almost 60 years, executive action, legal precedent, and regulations have recognized that civil servants moved involuntarily from the competitive service to the excepted service keep their rights. \nAnother commenter argued that 5 \nU.S.C. 7511(b) categorically exempts policy-influencing excepted service positions from chapter 75\u2019s adverse action procedures and OPM has no authority to extend civil service removal restrictions to employees in such positions. Comment 4097.\n267This misstates this final rule. OPM is not \nextending civil service protections to employees excluded by section 7511(b). OPM\u2019s regulatory amendments elaborate upon and clarify the retention of rights upon an involuntary move and further define the exception in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2), as explained further in Section IV(B), based on its longstanding interpretation of the statute, elucidated by legislative and statutory history, additional indicia of intent, and precedent. Commenter then contended that OPM fails to cite any cases holding that employees retain removal restrictions after their positions are determined to be policy-influencing and instead OPM cited two cases \u2018\u2018that deal with an entirely different issue.\u2019\u2019 (referring to footnote 117 of the proposed rule, which cites McCormick v. Department of the Air Force (2002) \nand Greene v. Defense Intelligence \nAgency (2005)). See Comment 4097. \nOPM did not cite either of those cases for this proposition. They were cited in this rulemaking because OPM is making conforming regulatory changes based on the precedent, holding that once an employee satisfactorily completes their probationary/trial period or durational \nrequirement under 5 U.S.C. 7511, they are entitled to adverse action rights. Footnote 117 from the proposed rule states, \u2018\u2018[t]hese proposed regulatory changes are consistent with how similar statutory rights have been interpreted by Federal courts and MSPB when \nemployees change jobs by moving to a different Federal agency.\u2019\u2019\n268That is \nprecisely the reason these two cases were cited. Also, as previously explained, longstanding precedent shows that employees retain adverse action protections if moved to or within the excepted service. See also Comment 2134, (detailing precedent, starting with Roth and including the Stanley cases, \nwhich explain that incumbent employees can retain rights even after their position is found to be policy- influencing). \nFinally, some commenters opposed to \nthe rule argued that pay and privileges should flow with the position, not the person. One professor emeritus commented that a basic principle of the civil service has been that pay and privileges flow to the position and it would be inconsistent for individuals to permanently carry with them the attributes and protections that applied to their previous positions. Comment 3953, see also Comment 4097 (\u2018\u2018Nothing \nin title 5 says or implies those restrictions follow individual employees.\u2019\u2019). Comment 3953 continued that it would be unreasonable to expect that individuals who move from \u2018\u2018career to noncareer positions\u2019\u2019 would, or could, permanently carry with them the protections they once enjoyed. But federal workers become \u2018\u2018employees\u2019\u2019 entitled to rights under chapter 75 based on their ability to complete a probationary/trial period and continuous service in a position or similar position.\n269Once those rights \nare earned, employees retain that status even if they are moved to an excepted service schedule or within the excepted service, so long as the move was involuntary. A move from \u2018\u2018career to noncareer positions\u2019\u2019 would only retain adverse action rights, as explained above, if such a move was involuntary. For instance, a voluntary movement from the competitive service to Schedule C would require an acknowledgment from the employee that adverse action rights would be waived.\n270A contrary rule would allow \nFederal workers to be reclassified at the whim of an agency without regard to how the civil service system has operated for decades, despite longstanding reliance on these protections by the Federal workforce. \nOPM is promulgating the following \nchanges to 5 CFR parts 212 and 752: \nPart 212\u2014Competitive Service and \nCompetitive Status \nSubpart D\u2014Effect of Competitive Status \non Position \nSection 212.401 Effect of Competitive \nStatus on Position \nPart 212 addresses competitive \nservice and competitive status and this final rule revises the regulations in 5 CFR 212.401(b) regarding the effect of an employee\u2019s competitive status on the employee\u2019s position. This final rule establishes that a competitive service employee whose position is first listed under Schedule A, B, C, or any future excepted service schedule remains in the competitive service for the purposes of status and protections, while the employee continues to occupy the position or any other positions to which the employee is moved involuntarily. \nAs described throughout this final \nrule, OPM\u2019s longstanding view is that Federal employees maintain the civil service status and protections that they have accrued.

OPM is updating to account for the possibility of new excepted service schedules which may be established after promulgation of this rule or other efforts to involuntarily move positions to or within the excepted service. \nComments Regarding Amendments to 5 \nCFR 212.401 \nOne commenter opposed to the rule \nexpressed a view that OPM believes is a misreading of the regulatory change. Comment 3190, a law school clinic, argued that the rulemaking creates \u2018\u2018a new pathway for burrowing\u2019\u2019 because it would amend 5 CFR 212.401(b) to allow that an \u2018\u2018employee in the competitive service at the time his position is first listed under Schedule A, B, or C, or whose position is otherwise moved from the competitive service and listed under a schedule created subsequent to\u2019\u2019 the effective date of final rule, to remain in the competitive service.\n272Commenter \nargued that, under such a provision, an outgoing administration could burrow personnel by promoting ideologically aligned competitive service civil servants to Schedule C positions. A president would then be stuck with individuals who oppose his agenda, even though Schedule C positions are \u2018\u2018policy determining\u2019\u2019 positions that often \u2018\u2018involve a close and confidential working relationship with the head of an agency or other key appointed officials.\u2019\u2019\n273OPM believes this concern \nis misplaced. The portion of the regulation that commenter identifies, relating to Schedules A, B, and C, is not a \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 revision in this final rule. That language already existed in 5 CFR 212.401(b) prior to this rule\u2019s amendment and dates to 1968.\n274The final rule adds the language, \u2018\u2018or whose \nposition is otherwise moved from the competitive service and listed under a schedule created subsequent to [effective date of final rule],\u2019\u2019 to establish that a competitive service employee whose position is first listed under any future excepted service schedule remains in the competitive service as long as the employee continues to occupy the position, or any other positions, in sequence to which the employee is moved involuntarily, as has been the case for almost 60 years. \nAs explained above and in Comment \n2134, the original language in 5 CFR 212.401(b) was added during the Johnson Administration to track judicial decisions finding that employees \nretained accrued status and civil service protection upon an involuntary movement to excepted service positions. Regarding Schedule C, specifically, the CSC in 1955 noted the difference between an employee\u2019s voluntary and involuntary movement to that schedule. Regarding a voluntary move, the CSC explained that competitive service employees would lose adverse action rights. It stated, \u2018\u2018a vacant Schedule C job may not be filled by the appointment of an employee serving in the competitive service until the employee has been given notice in writing that acceptance of the position will result in his leaving the competitive service. Leaving the competitive service would result in his giving up the job- removal protections of the Lloyd La Follette Act.\u2019\u2019 Conversely, in the case of an involuntary movement, the CSC noted that a competitive service employee would retain their rights, explaining, \u2018\u2018if an occupied job in the competitive civil service is moved to Schedule C, an incumbent who has civil-service status continues to have the removal protection of the Lloyd-La Follette Act during his occupancy of the position.\u2019\u2019 See Comment 2134.\n275OPM \nalso issued an advisory during the Reagan Administration that explained, \u2018\u2018[t]he only Schedule C employees covered by statutory appeal procedures [under 5 U.S.C. 7513] and who, therefore, may appeal removal actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) are those who were serving in a position in the competitive service when OPM authorized its conversion to Schedule C and who still serve in those positions (i.e., have status in the \nposition\u2014cf. Roth v. Brownell, 215 F.2d \n500 (D.C. Cir. 1954)).\u2019\u2019 See Comment 2134 (brackets in original). In that \nadvisory, OPM continued, \u2018\u2018[a]n employee who was serving in a position in the competitive service when OPM authorized its conversion to Schedule C and is still serving in that position may be removed from that position \u2018for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\u2019 Moreover, the action must be taken in accordance with the procedures established by 5 U.S.C. 7511 et seq. and part 752 of OPM\u2019s regulations. These procedures provide for the right: (1) to a 30-day advance written notice which states the reasons for the proposed removal specifically and in detail; (2) to reply personally and in writing; (3) to be represented; (4) to have the reply considered; and (5) to a written decision stating the reasons for the action. The employee may appeal the action to MSPB.\u2019\u2019 For these reasons, OPM disagrees with Comment 3190 and the conclusions that this provision regarding Schedules A, B, and C is new or problematic. \nOther commenters were generally \nsupportive of this regulatory change. Comment 2134, a joint comment by a nonprofit organization and former federal official, was supportive but suggested that \u00a7 212.401(b) be revised to clarify that competitive status is defined in \u00a7 212.301. OPM will adopt this suggestion and revise \u00a7 212.401(b) to specifically reference an employee in the competitive service who had competitive status as defined in \u00a7 212.301. This revision reduces the risk of inconsistent interpretation or application of the regulations by referring to competitive status with uniform language. \nThis comment also suggested that \nOPM revise \u00a7 212.401(b) to address the movement of employees and not only the movement of positions. The comment also suggested that OPM revise the rule to make explicit that employees who otherwise meet the conditions of \u00a7 212.401 retain their competitive status regardless of the number of times the position or employee is moved involuntarily (so long as the sequence is not broken by a voluntary decision to apply for and accept a different position, in which case, different rules may apply). OPM will revise the language to clarify, based on the context and history described above, that once status and rights are accrued, the key to determining whether they are retained upon a move is whether the move was voluntary or involuntary. The number of times the employee is moved is immaterial to this analysis if all such movements are \ninvoluntary. OPM will therefore revise the end of \u00a7 212.401(b) accordingly. \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00035 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25016 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n27688 FR 63862, 63871, 63881. \n277197 F.3d 1144 (Fed.

Comment 2849. It stated, with respect to the part 752 amendments, that \u2018\u2018[i]f an administration can bypass the civil service framework established by Congress in the CSRA by moving employees to a new excepted service, it would undermine the intention of the CSRA and make its extensive employee protections obsolete.\u2019\u2019 Another management association said that, with respect to part 752, OPM\u2019s rule provides sufficient protections and clarity. Comment 763. \nA national union stated the proposed \nlanguage for part 752 \u2018\u2018would effectively deter moving a federal employee\u2019s position to the excepted service for the purpose of retaliation, circumvention of due process, or discriminatory action against any federal employee.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3278. A different national union stated that one reason for their support of the amendments to part 752 was because \u2018\u2018employees will not feel safe reporting fraud, waste, and abuse unless they have the ability to challenge arbitrary, unfounded, and/or unreasonable disciplinary actions.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2640. \nA local union stated that OPM\u2019s \nproposed language to amend 5 CFR part 752 \u2018\u2018ensures that employees moved into excepted positions retain their critical rights and should be enacted as proposed.\u2019\u2019 Comment 1042. The local union maintained that adverse action procedures and appeal rights ensure that Federal employees are retained based on merit and are protected from retaliation and discrimination, including due to their political affiliation. This commenter further asserted that the rights accrued in a prior Federal position should not be lost solely because the employee has been moved involuntarily, as such an approach would encourage retaliation and limit agencies\u2019 ability to recruit top candidates due to applicants\u2019 fears that they could eventually lose protections they earned in that federal position by administrative reassignment. \nAnother organization said that they \n\u2018\u2018particularly support\u2019\u2019 the amendments to part 752 to clarify that employees who are moved from the competitive service or from one excepted service schedule to another retain the protections they had already accrued. Comment 1904. \nAs stated above, other commenters \nexpressed general disapproval of OPM\u2019s regulatory amendments to part 752. OPM is not persuaded to make any revisions based on those comments for the reasons stated above, namely the comments are at odds with existing protections in chapter 75 that OPM\u2019s final rule clarifies, and the statutory text, legislative history, and legal precedents construing it. \nSubpart B\u2014Regulatory Requirements for \nSuspension for 14 Days or Less \nThis subpart addresses the procedural \nrequirements for suspensions of 14 days or less for covered employees. Chapter 75 of title 5, U.S. Code, provides a straightforward process for agencies to use in adverse actions involving suspensions of this duration. The changes conform this subpart with statutory language to clarify which employees are covered by subpart B when an agency takes an action for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. \nSection 752.201 Coverage \nThis section describes when an \nemployee has or retains coverage under \nthe procedures of this subpart. Paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(6) of 5 CFR 752.201 enumerate the conditions under which an individual would qualify for coverage. OPM\u2019s revision to 5 CFR 752.201(b)(1) prescribes that, even if an agency intends to suspend for 14 days or less an employee in the competitive service who is serving a probationary or trial period, the employee is entitled to the procedural rights provided under 5 U.S.C. 7503 if the individual has completed 1 year of current service in the same or similar position under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. \nAs set forth in the proposed rule,\n276 \nOPM is revising subpart B of part 752 to conform to the Federal Circuit decisions in Van Wersch v. Department \nof Health & Human Services\n277and \nMcCormick v. Department of the Air \nForce.278These cases now guide the \nway the MSPB applies 5 U.S.C. 7511(a)(1), which defines employees who have the right to appeal major adverse actions, such as removals, to the MSPB. Van Wersch addressed the \ndefinition of \u2018\u2018employee\u2019\u2019 for purposes of nonpreference eligibles in the excepted service and, a few years later, \nMcCormick addressed the meaning of \n\u2018\u2018employee\u2019\u2019 for purposes of the competitive service. As explained supra, section 7511(a)(1) states that \n\u2018\u2018employees\u2019\u2019 include individuals who meet specified conditions relating to the duration of their service or, for nonpreference eligibles, relating to their probationary or trial period status. The Federal Circuit explained that the word \u2018\u2018or,\u2019\u2019 here, refers to alternatives: some individuals who traditionally had been considered probationers with limited rights are actually entitled to the same appeal rights afforded to non- probationers if the individuals meet the other requirements of section 7511(a)(1), namely (1) their prior service is \u2018\u2018current continuous service,\u2019\u2019 (2) the current continuous service is in the \u2018\u2018same or similar positions\u2019\u2019 for purposes of nonpreference eligibles in the excepted service, and (3) the total amount of such service meets a 1 or 2-year requirement, and was not in a temporary appointment limited to 1 or 2 years, depending on the service.\n279 \nIn a prior rulemaking,280OPM \nmodified its regulations for appealable adverse actions in 5 CFR part 752, subpart D, to align with Van Wersch and McCormick and statutory language. \nOPM has consistently advised agencies construing 5 U.S.C. 7501 to do so in light of the Federal Circuit\u2019s interpretation of similar statutory language in 5 U.S.C. 7511. In this rule, OPM modifies language in 5 CFR 752.201(b)(1) to conform to that understanding (and thus with the statutory language in 5 U.S.C. 7501, as construed by the Federal Circuit in a precedential decision). OPM\u2019s revision to section 752.201(b)(1) prescribes that, even if an employee in the competitive service who has been suspended for 14 days or less is serving a probationary or trial period, the employee retains the procedural rights provided under 5 U.S.C. 7503 if the individual has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar position under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. \nComments Regarding Amendments to 5 \nCFR 752.201 \nSome commenters discussed OPM\u2019s \nchanges to conform regulations to Federal Circuit precedent in Van Wersch and McCormick and most were \nsupportive.

An organization emphasized its support of OPM\u2019s change to section 752.201 regarding the employees eligible for grievance rights for suspensions. Comment 1904. \nOne former political appointee \nopposed to the rule questioned how an individual meets the criterion for \u2018\u2018continuous service\u2019\u2019 in this regulatory change. Comment 45. Commenter asked how \u2018\u2018continuous service\u2019\u2019 applies to individuals who are teleworking or \u2018\u2018not turning on their government computers given certain data from the Government Accountability Office about the \u2018massive increase in telework and underutilization of office buildings.\u2019\u2019\u2019 OPM is unclear whether this is a serious inquiry, but notes that the term \u2018\u2018current continuous employment\u2019\u2019 is defined in 5 CFR 752.201(d) for suspensions of 14 days or less as \u2018\u2018a period of employment or service immediately preceding a suspension action without a break in \nFederal civilian employment of a workday,\u2019\u2019 and does not turn on whether the employee is exercising flexibilities such as remote work or telework. Although commenter raised concerns about \u2018\u2018continuous service\u2019\u2019 with respect to section 752.201, OPM also notes that the language is present in subpart D of part 752 as it applies to regulatory requirements for removals, suspensions for more than 14 days, reductions in grade or pay, and furloughs for 30 days or less. In section 752.402, the term \u2018\u2018current continuous employment\u2019\u2019 is defined as \u2018\u2018a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday.\u2019\u2019 This rulemaking does not amend these definitions. Apart from the fact that these definitions are unrelated to an individual\u2019s use of telework or occupancy in government office buildings, we note that, during a lengthy period starting in March 2020 and extending into the beginning of the Biden Administration, Federal office buildings were closed to all but a few employees whose work required their physical presence, making it unavoidable that most employees were working from alternative locations.\n281 \nAccordingly, the need to monitor whether employees are actually working when not in the agency\u2019s brick-and- mortar workplace is not a new consideration and can be addressed, as \nalways, through traditional performance management tools. OPM has already issued extensive guidance on this topic.\n282 \nIn addition, the amended regulations \nsection 752.201(b)(1) through (b)(6) explain that individuals retain their status as covered employees if they are moved involuntarily from the competitive service to the excepted service, unless specifically prohibited by law. \nOne joint comment by a nonprofit \norganization and former federal official supportive of the rule argued that OPM\u2019s proposed language for section 752.201(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(6) provides coverage if the employee is moved involuntarily and \u2018\u2018still occupies that position or a similar position[.]\u2019\u2019 Comment 2134. Likewise, commenter noted that section 752.201(b)(4) applies only if the employee still occupies that position. Commenter stated that these provisions collectively may be too narrow to achieve OPM\u2019s purpose and that the \u2018\u2018number of involuntary moves should not be relevant to the coverage of this subsection.\u2019\u2019 Commenter noted that an agency might deliberately move an employee to a dissimilar position for the purpose of stripping the employee of their rights. For these reasons, the organization \u2018\u2018suggest[s] that OPM end these paragraphs with the following language: \u2018that position or another position to which the employee is moved involuntarily.\u2019\u2019\u2019 \nOPM agrees with commenter that the \nrevision suggested would better meet and strengthen the policy that OPM is advancing with the final rule, and we will revise these provisions accordingly. OPM\u2019s proposed rule was based the procedural rights in section 752.201(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(6) in Subchapter I of chapter 75, title 5, U.S. Code. The definitions for that subchapter are codified at 5 U.S.C. 7501, which defines an employee as \u2018\u2018an individual in the competitive service who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment or who has completed 1 year of current continuous employment in the same or similar positions under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less.\u2019\u2019 (emphasis added). OPM agrees with commenter, though, that the \u2018\u2018same or similar positions\u2019\u2019 language used in chapter 75 relates to how rights are accrued in the first instance. Based on the precedent described above, the key factor to whether accrued status and rights are retained following a move to or within the excepted service is whether the move was voluntary or involuntary. The position to which an employee is involuntarily moved need not be the \u2018\u2018same or similar\u2019\u2019 for the employee who has already accrued rights to continue to retain such rights. OPM will therefore revise the provisions in paragraphs 5 CFR 752.201(b)(1), (b)(2), and- (b)(6) by clarifying that the provision applies where the employee is moved involuntarily and continues to occupy that position or any other position to which the employee is moved involuntarily. In addition, based on the precedent explained above, OPM will revise 5 CFR 752.201(b)(3) through (5) to apply the same language. \nThe final rule also establishes a new \n5 CFR 752.201(c)(7) to make clear that employees in positions determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character as defined in 5 CFR 210.102 are excluded from coverage under subpart B of part 752, consistent with congressional intent and as described more fully below.\n283 \nAn agency commented that the \n\u2018\u2018inclusions/exclusions in 5 CFR 752.201 appear to conflict.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2766. The agency explained that the subsection of the proposed regulation addressing employees included at \u00a7 752.201(b) indicates that in many cases, \u2018\u2018an employee will be covered if the employee is moved involuntarily into the excepted service (or [into a] different schedule[ ]of the excepted service) and still occupies this position.\u2019\u2019 The agency noted, however, that the subsection addressing employees excluded at \u00a7 752.201(c) would preclude coverage of individuals whose position has been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. The agency noted that subsection (c) does not specify that the exclusion would apply only if the individual lacked the accrued rights referenced in paragraph (b). The agency then recommended a change to \u00a7 752.201(c)(7) to address the perceived conflict. \nBased on this agency\u2019s comment, \nOPM is persuaded that a change is necessary to effectuate the policy advanced by this final rule consistent with statutory text, legislative history, and legal precedents.

Def. Intel.

OPM will accept the agency\u2019s recommendation to revise the exclusion at \u00a7 752.201(c)(7) by clarifying that the exclusion does not apply if the incumbent was moved involuntarily to such a position after accruing rights as delineated in \u00a7 752.201(b). \nSubpart D\u2014Regulatory Requirements \nfor Removal, Suspension for More Than 14 Days, Reduction in Grade or Pay, or Furlough for 30 Days or Less \nThis subpart addresses the procedural \nrequirements for removal, suspension for more than 14 days, reduction in grade or pay, or furlough for 30 days or less for covered employees. This includes, but is not limited to, adverse actions based on misconduct or unacceptable performance. The changes are intended to reinforce the civil service protections that apply when an agency pursues certain adverse actions for the efficiency of the service under chapter 75. \nSection 752.401 Coverage \nThe changes add language to provide \nthat an \u2018\u2018employee\u2019\u2019 (i.e., for purposes of \nthis part, an individual who has accrued \nadverse action rights by completing probation or a current continuous service requirement) who occupies a position that is moved from the competitive service into the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another, is covered by the regulatory requirements for removal, suspension for more than 14 days, reduction in grade or pay, or furlough for 30 days or less. \nThe changes to \u00a7 752.401 reflect the \nimpact of statutory requirements\u2014 namely, that once an employee meets certain conditions, the individual gains certain statutory procedural rights and civil service protections which cannot be taken away from the individual by moving the employee\u2019s position involuntarily into the excepted service, or within the excepted service. These regulatory changes are consistent with how similar statutory rights have been interpreted by Federal courts and the MSPB when employees change jobs by \nmoving to a different Federal agency.\n284 \nParagraph (c) of 5 CFR 752.401 \nenumerates the conditions under which an individual would qualify for coverage. The amended regulation explains that those individuals retain their status if moved involuntarily unless specifically prohibited by law. \nConsistent with the proposed rule,\n285 \nOPM\u2019s final rule revises \u00a7 752.401(c) to clarify that employees in the competitive and excepted services who have fulfilled their probationary or trial period requirement or the durational requirements under 5 U.S.C. 7511 will retain the rights conferred by subchapter II if moved involuntarily from the competitive service to the excepted service or within the excepted service to a new excepted service schedule, except in the case where an employee relinquishes such rights or status by voluntarily seeking, accepting, and encumbering a position that explicitly results in a loss of, or different, rights. \nComments Regarding Amendments to 5 \nCFR 752.401 \nOne former political appointee \nopposed to the rule cited language in the proposed rule regarding the retention of rights on an involuntary move or the relinquishment of rights on a voluntary move and characterized it as \nOPM wanting \u2018\u2018employees being transferred to have the authority to determine if they relinquish their pay/ benefits/protections\u2019\u2019 which would be, commenter argued, the \u2018\u2018equivalent of placing someone on paid leave but allowing them to decide how much pay to receive while they are gone.\u2019\u2019 Comment 45. OPM disagrees with this assessment. This section of OPM\u2019s proposed rule addressed rights following the movement of an employee and differentiated between voluntary and involuntary movements.\n286It is not, \nas Commenter seems to suggest, similar to leave following a disciplinary action. As explained in the proposed rule and this final rule, absent a voluntary movement, accrued rights are established in statute, as confirmed by case law construing the statute, and cannot be taken from employees by involuntarily moving them. Commenter\u2019s comparison of the retention of rights following a move to an employee\u2019s rights following a disciplinary action is therefore inapt. As with 5 CFR 752.201, Comment \n2134, which strongly supported the proposed amendments, requested modifications to ensure that if \u2018\u2018an agency moves an employee involuntarily more than once, the employee\u2019\u2019 would \u2018\u2018retain any applicable status and civil service protections.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2134. Commenter contended that an agency might deliberately move an employee multiple times to a dissimilar position for the purpose of stripping the employee of rights. Commenter noted that OPM\u2019s proposed language for \u00a7 752.401(c)(3), (4), (5), and (7) provides coverage if the employee is moved involuntarily and \u2018\u2018still occupies that position or a similar position[.]\u2019\u2019 Commenter recommended \u2018\u2018replacing language that refers to a subsequent movement to a \u2018similar position\u2019 with language that refers to any position to which an employee is moved involuntarily.\u2019\u2019 For these reasons, commenter recommended adding the language, \u2018\u2018or another position to which the employee is moved involuntarily\u2019\u2019 directly after \u2018\u2018and still occupies that position\u2019\u2019 in each of these paragraphs. \nOPM is persuaded that this concern is \nwell-founded and that the change would strengthen the policy that the final rule advances. OPM will revise these provisions accordingly. Section 752.401(c)(3) covers an \u2018\u2018employee in the excepted service who is a preference eligible in an Executive agency as defined at section 105 of title 5, United States Code, the U.S. Postal Service, or the Postal Regulatory Commission[.]\u2019\u2019 Section 752.401(c)(4) covers certain individuals in the Postal Service, and \u00a7 752.401(c)(5) covers certain nonpreference eligibles in the excepted service. OPM\u2019s proposed rule focused on the fact that all such individuals derive their rights and protections from 5 U.S.C. 7511(a)(1)(B) or (a)(1)(C), both of which require the work to have been performed \u2018\u2018in the same or similar positions[.]\u2019\u2019 With respect to \u00a7 752.401(c)(7), the language covers an employee who previously \u2018\u2018was\u2019\u2019 in the competitive service with competitive status and is currently in the excepted service. As explained above, OPM agrees with commenter that the \u2018\u2018same or similar positions\u2019\u2019 language used in chapter 75 relates to how rights are accrued in the first instance and the key factor in determining whether accrued status and rights are retained following a move to or within the excepted service is whether the move was voluntary or involuntary. OPM will therefore revise the provisions in 5 CFR 752.401(c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) to replace the words \u2018\u2018a \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25019 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n287See Public Law 117\u201381, 135 Stat. 1541, Sec. \n1106(a)(1). 288See Public Law 117\u201381, Sec. 1106(a)(1). 289See 5 U.S.C. 7541\u20137543. similar position\u2019\u2019 with the words \u2018\u2018any \nother position to which the employee is moved involuntarily.\u2019\u2019 In addition, OPM will revise 5 CFR 752.401(c)(6) and (c)(8) to apply the same language. In 5 CFR 752.401(c)(7), OPM will replace \u2018\u2018a similar position\u2019\u2019 with the words \u2018\u2018any other position to which the employee is moved involuntarily.\u2019\u2019 OPM will also correct a typographical error by changing the period at the end of 5 CFR 752.401(d)(2)(iii) to a semicolon. \nIn addition, the final rule modifies 5 \nCFR 752.401(d)(2) to make clear that employees in positions determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character as defined in 5 CFR 210.102 are excluded from coverage under subpart D of part 752. In this final rule, OPM defines these terms as descriptors for the positions held by noncareer political appointees, as discussed in Section IV(B). \nAs with 5 CFR 752.201, an agency \nasserted that the \u2018\u2018inclusions/exclusions in 5 CFR 752.401 appear to conflict.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2766. The agency expressed that the subsection addressing employees excluded at section 752.401(d) would preclude coverage of individuals whose position has been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or \npolicy-advocating character but does not specify that the exclusion would apply only if the individual lacked the accrued rights referenced in paragraph (c). The agency then recommended a change to 5 CFR 752.401(d)(2) to address the perceived conflict. Based on this agency\u2019s comment, OPM is persuaded that a change is necessary for the same reasons explained above relating to 5 CFR 752.201. OPM will revise the exclusion at \u00a7 752.401(d)(2) by clarifying that the exclusion does not apply if the incumbent was moved involuntarily to such a position after accruing rights as delineated in \u00a7 752.401(c).\u2019\u2019 \nFinally, this final rule revises 5 CFR \n752.401(c)(2)(ii) to reflect the repeal of 10 U.S.C. 1599e, effective December 31, 2022, by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.\n287The repeal restores a 1-year \nprobationary period for covered Department of Defense employees (and also reduces the alternative continuous service prong to 1 year). With respect to OPM\u2019s amendment to reflect the repeal of the 2-year probationary period in the Department of Defense, an individual disagreed with OPM\u2019s chosen language, stating that the proposed regulation would \u2018\u2018codify an erroneous reading of \nthe clear language\u2019\u2019 of sections 7501 and 7511 of title 5, U.S. Code. Comment 474. Commenter expressed concern that under OPM\u2019s proposed regulation, individuals who were in a 2-year probationary period at the time of their appointment (due to the now-repealed law) would not benefit from the conforming amendment that modified 5 U.S.C. 7511 to remove references to the now-repealed 2-year period. Commenter discussed both Department of Defense guidance and multiple canons of statutory construction. Commenter stated that the provision in 5 CFR 752.401(c)(2)(ii) in the proposed rule should be deleted in the final rule to reflect the language of 5 U.S.C. 7501(1) and 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). \nOPM will not adopt commenter\u2019s \nsuggested revision but will make a clarification. Section 1106 of Public Law 117\u201381 had two sections, (a) and (b). Section (a) repealed a 2-year probationary period in the Department of Defense. Section (b) provided the \u2018\u2018Technical and Conforming Amendments.\u2019\u2019 Section (a) states that the modifications of probationary periods created by the repeal \u2018\u2018shall only apply to an individual appointed as such an employee on or after the effective date specified\u2019\u2019 by the statute.\n288The amendments to the U.S. \nCode that follow in section (b) are alterations intended to conform the code to the intent of the legislation, including the repeal of similar provisions in 5 U.S.C. 7501 and 5 U.S.C. 7511. OPM interprets Public Law 117\u201381 section 1106(a)(1) to mean that someone who was on a 2-year probationary period (or 2-year continuous service requirement) under section 1599e as of the effective date of the repeal, must still complete one of those 2-year periods notwithstanding the repeal. Anyone hired on or after the effective date, need only complete a 1-year period. The current regulatory text indicates that covered employee includes an employee \u2018\u2018[e]xcept as provided in section 1599e of title 10, United States Code, who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less.\u2019\u2019 OPM will therefore revise this provision to clarify that the 2-year probationary period applies to individuals hired prior to December 31, 2022, the date that section was otherwise repealed by Public Law 117\u201381, section 1106. Additional Comments Regarding \nAmendments to 5 CFR Part 752 \nA former federal official supportive of \nthe rule suggested that OPM clarify that the changes proposed in 5 CFR part 752 include SES Positions. Comment 2816. Commenter included proposed language that would modify 5 CFR 752.601, which deals with regulatory requirements for taking adverse action relating to the SES. Commenter suggested adding \u2018\u2018including such an employee who is moved involuntarily into the excepted service and still occupies that position or a similar position\u2019\u2019 at the end of 5 CFR 752.601(c)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), and (2)(i). OPM agrees with the policy goal that SES employees maintain their adverse action protections, but we will not make any changes in response to this comment. As described further in Section IV(B), this rule addresses the competitive and excepted services, specifically the retention of status and rights upon an involuntary movement from the competitive service into or within the excepted service, the exclusion of adverse action rights for excepted service positions of a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character,\u2019\u2019 and processes for moving employees and positions from the competitive service into or within the excepted service. As described above, the SES is its own separate service that it is not governed by provisions applicable to the competitive or excepted services. Any transfer of SES employees and positions would be governed by the SES statute and regulations. Importantly, the exception to adverse action rights under 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) does also not apply to the SES. The career SES is governed by separate adverse action procedures that, unlike the rules governing the competitive and excepted services, make no mention of whether a position is of \u2018\u2018a confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- advocating character.\u2019\u2019\n289For these \nreasons, as explained more fully below in Section IV(B), OPM will make no modifications to the rule based on this suggestion. \nB. Positions of a Confidential, Policy- \nDetermining, Policy-Making, or Policy- Advocating Character \nPart 210 of title 5, Code of Federal \nRegulations, addresses basic concepts and definitions used throughout the Civil Service regulations in 5 CFR chapter I, subchapter B.

OPM is conforming changes to 5 CFR 213.3301, 302.101, \n432.101, 451.302, 752.201, and 752.401 to standardize the phrasing used to describe this type of position. \nAs explained in this section and in \nthe proposed rule,\n290Congress has been \ncareful to strike a balance between career employees\u2014who are covered by civil service protections under chapter 75 because of the need for a professional civil service no matter whether they are in the competitive or excepted service\u2014 and political appointees who serve as confidential assistants and advisors to the President and other politically appointed officials who have direct responsibility for carrying out the Administration\u2019s political objectives. These political appointees are not required to compete for their positions in the same manner as career employees, serve at the pleasure of their superiors, and have no expectation of continued employment beyond the presidential administration during which their appointment occurred. \nWhen Congress created the adverse \naction protections under chapter 75, it excluded, among others, employees appointed by the President, with or without Senate confirmation,\n291and employees in the excepted service \n\u2018\u2018whose position has been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\u2019\u2019\n292Likewise, Congress \nspecifically excluded from the positions safeguarded against prohibited personnel practices under 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2)(B)(i) any position that is \u2018\u2018excepted from the competitive service because of its confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating character.\u2019\u2019 \nChapter 75 does not specifically \ndefine the phrase as used in the 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) exception, but as described in the proposed rule\u2014and as made further clear by public comments\u2014this is a term of art and the history of the phrase and the exception have long meant political appointees. \nComments Regarding the Need To \nClarify the Exception \nSeveral commenters agreed with OPM \nthat the phrase in this exception needs further clarification because of the risk it could be read, counter to the history of its usage, unreasonably broadly to strip rights from career civil servants. One commenter discussed the difficulty in identifying which employees have duties that are of a \u2018\u2018[c]onfidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 character if the phrase is interpreted not to mean, as has been broadly understood for decades, political appointees. Comment 6. Merely being in an office or position titled \u2018\u2018policy,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018policy analysis,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018policy implementation\u2019\u2019 or such is not determinative. Likewise, some employees with a title such as \u2018\u2018policy analyst\u2019\u2019 or in an office with a policy or planning-related title may be mid- or lower-level. And countless federal employees work on issues that relate to or touch upon policy. Thus, commenter argued, OPM\u2019s proposal to define these policy positions as used in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) to noncareer political appointees will be \u2018\u2018helpful in limiting \nthe adverse impacts\u2019\u2019 of politicization to policy roles. Another commenter argued that, without these changes, there is a risk of overbroad classification of positions as \u2018\u2018policy-making,\u2019\u2019 potentially subjecting a substantial number of federal employees to unwarranted political interference. Comment 2516. Commenter argued that this interference could adversely impact employees\u2019 ability to perform their duties effectively and could potentially paralyze the essential functions of their agencies. Therefore, \u2018\u2018the need for clear delineation in the interpretation of these terms is paramount to prevent \nunintended consequences that could impede vital government services.\u2019\u2019 Id., see also Comment 3491. A professor emeritus noted that the different potential interpretations of the exception are represented in the various estimates on the potential scope of Schedule F. See Comment 3953. \nCommenter showed that, in the early days of Schedule F, the estimates were \u2018\u2018in the thousands.\u2019\u2019 Since then, the proponents have varyingly suggested that the number would be at least 50,000 and perhaps as many as 100,000.\n293In public discussions, some \nSchedule F supporters have made clear that their goal is for all 2.2 million federal employees to serve at the pleasure of the president. Id. \nConversely, a former political \nappointee argued that the statutory exception was clear and did not require further definition. See Comment 45. \nOPM believes that the phrase itself\u2014 \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-making, policy- determining or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019\u2014 may be, when viewed in isolation, capable of more than one interpretation. \nBut employing the standard tools of statutory interpretation, including past practice, legislative history, intent, and legal precedents, provides that the best reading of the exception refers to noncareer political appointees typically listed in Schedule C. \nComment Regarding the History of the \nException \nThe same joint comment by a \nnonprofit organization and former federal official that extensively detailed the historical treatment of accrued status and civil service protections upon an involuntary move to an excepted service schedule, summarized in Section IV(A), also commented at length regarding the executive branch\u2019s historical understanding that the exception for \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- advocating\u2019\u2019 positions applies only to a small class of political appointee positions. See Comment 2134. This \nphrase and the related phrase, \u2018\u2018confidential or policy-determining,\u2019\u2019 have \u2018\u2018been used with consistency for between seven and nine decades.\u2019\u2019 This history is important because, as OPM recounts in its proposed rule and in this final rule, a common understanding of the terminology gave meaning to the \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25021 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n294Citing 6 U.S.C. 349(d)(3) (\u2018\u2018For purposes of \nparagraph (1)\u2014(A) the term \u2018career employee\u2019 \nmeans any employee (as such term is defined in section 2105 of title 5), but does not include a political appointee; and (B) the term \u2018political appointee\u2019 means any employee who occupies a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating character.\u2019\u2019). \n295Citing 7 U.S.C. 6992(e)(2). \n296Citing 5 U.S.C. 9803(c)(2). \n297Citing U.S. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, \u2018\u2018VA\u2019s \nAdministrations,\u2019\u2019 https://www.ruralhealth.va.gov/ \naboutus/structure.asp#:\u223c:text=VA%20is%20the%20federal%20government\u2019s,Veterans%2C%20their%20families%20and%20survivors. 298Citing 5 U.S.C. 4107(b)(3), 5753(a)(2), 5754, \n5758, 10104(d), see also 12 U.S.C. 4511, 5584; 22 U.S.C. 3983(d)(3); 38 U.S.C. 308(d)(2). \n299Citing 42 U.S.C. 904(c), see also 5 U.S.C. \n1215(b) (Office of Special Counsel statute that requires that office to notify the President of a Hatch Act violation by \u2018\u2018an employee in a confidential, policy-making, policy-determining, or policy-advocating position appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,\u2019\u2019 which reinforces political meaning of the phrase), 2 U.S.C. 1601 (Lobbying Disclosure Act listing \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy- making, policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 with other political appointees and executive and military officers). \n300Citing Democratic Party Platform of 1936 (June \n23, 1936) (\u2018\u2018For the protection of government itself and promotion of its efficiency, we pledge the immediate extension of the merit system through the classified civil service . . . to all non-policy- making positions in the Federal service.\u2019\u2019), https:// \nwww.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/1936- \ndemocratic-party-platform. \n301Citing Task Force on Pers. & Civil Serv., \nReport on Personnel and Civil Service, 6 (1955) https://www.google.com/books/edition/Report _on_\nPersonnel_ and_ Civil_ Service/ytR9zYFWVtwC; U.S. \nCivil Serv.

See Comment 2134. \nBecause of the extensive citation to \nfacts and history relevant to this regulatory change, OPM summarizes commenter\u2019s arguments here. \nCommenter began with the legal \ncontext of the exception. While the phrase \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- advocating\u2019\u2019 is not further defined in chapter 75, commenter argued that other sections of the U.S. Code make clear that this phrase refers to political appointees. Commenter cited as examples four laws that directly state that incumbents of \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 positions are political appointees. One law applicable to the Department of Homeland Security declares plainly that \u2018\u2018the term \u2018political appointee\u2019 means any employee who occupies a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating character.\u2019\u2019\n294Congress used \nsimilar language in laws applicable to the Department of Agriculture,\n295the \nNational Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration,296and the Department \nof Veterans Affairs.297Commenter also \nshowed that Congress has enacted laws that apply restrictions to classes of political appointees that include incumbents of positions of a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 character, including laws with government-wide applicability.\n298 \nFurther illustrating the political \nnature of positions excluded under 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2), commenter cited a law applicable to the Social Security Administration that imposes an aggregate limit on the total number of noncareer (i.e., political) SES positions \nand confidential or policy positions.\n299 \nIn addition to pointing to Congress\u2019 \nunderstanding of the phrases, commenter also extensively detailed the history of these phrases through various administrations, beginning in 1936 with the Roosevelt Administration, and concluded that this context further supports OPM\u2019s definition in this rulemaking. The history confirms that these phrases have the same meaning, refer to political appointees, and cover only a small number of positions in the executive branch (roughly 1,500). \nAs commenter points out, at least as \nearly as the Roosevelt Administration, the executive branch sought to treat confidential and policy positions differently than it treated career excepted and competitive service employees.\n300In 1937, President \nRoosevelt called for converting all positions other than \u2018\u2018policy-forming\u2019\u2019 positions to the classified (i.e., competitive) service, a position with which the CSC agreed.\n301 \nFurther, as commenter noted, and as \nOPM explained in its proposed rulemaking, the Roosevelt Administration\u2019s Brownlow Committee, studying the executive branch organization, issued a report explaining that its conception of policy- \ndetermining positions was extremely narrow and such positions should be \u2018\u2018relatively few in number,\u2019\u2019 consisting mainly of \u2018\u2018the heads of executive departments, under secretaries and assistant secretaries, the members of the regulatory commissions, the heads of a few of the large bureaus engaged in activities with important policy implications, the chief diplomatic posts, and a limited number of other key positions.\u2019\u2019\n302 \nTestifying before Congress, Louis \nBrownlow, the committee chair, explained the meaning of this policy- determining position exception: \u2018\u2018[P]olicy-determining officers should be political officers and, in my opinion, should change when the President changes.\u2019\u2019\n303Contemporaneous \nmaterials support this meaning of the term \u2018\u2018policy-determining.\u2019\u2019\n304 \nPresident Roosevelt then pursued the \nCommittee\u2019s recommendation and issued Executive Order 7916,\n305 \nadopting the term \u2018\u2018policy-determining\u2019\u2019 in lieu of the term \u2018\u2018policy-forming\u2019\u2019 which his Administration had initially used. The order created a framework for giving employees in excepted service positions, other than those in \u2018\u2018policy- determining\u2019\u2019 positions, competitive status. \nTwo commissions led by former \nPresident Herbert Hoover agreed with the same reading of this exception. During the Truman Administration, the first Hoover Commission recommended a civil service exception for \u2018\u2018policy- making\u2019\u2019 positions, saying that \u2018\u2018[t]op policy-making officials must and should be appointed by the President. But all employment activities below these levels, including some positions now in the exempt category, should be carried on within the framework of the decentralized civil service system recommended in this report.\u2019\u2019\n306Later, \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25022 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \nOrder No. 8743, in the competitive service.\u2019\u2019), \nhttps://www.justice.gov/d9/olc/opinions/1979/04/ 31/op-olc-v003-p0140_ 0.pdf. \n307Citing Task Force on Pers. and Civil Serv., \nReport on Personnel and Civil service, p. 6 (1955) (emphasis added)), https://www.google.com/books/ edition/Report_ on_Personnel_ and_ Civil_ Service/ \nytR9zYFWVtwC. \n308Citing Press Release, The White House, p. 1 \n(Mar. 5, 1953) (signed by James C.

These are political appointees who are specifically excluded from a second Hoover commission \ndetermined the term \u2018\u2018policy- determining\u2019\u2019 was \u2018\u2018used to describe positions which should properly be reserved for political executives, and hence not be converted to classified status.\u2019\u2019\n307 \nThe Eisenhower Administration \nmaintained this same distinction between career positions and political positions. In March 1953, the White House issued a press release describing \u2018\u2018types of positions that do not belong in \nthe Civil Service System\u2019\u2019 which included (1) those positions that received a delegation to shape the policies of the Government and (2) those where the duties required a close personal and confidential relationship.\n308As commenter noted, \nthe focus of this press release was Schedule A because, at the time, career positions had been comingled with political positions under that schedule. Later that month, President Eisenhower created a new home for political positions through Executive Order 10440, which established Schedule C for both types of positions described in the press release. The order combined these types of positions, referring to them as \u2018\u2018positions of a confidential or policy-determining character.\u2019\u2019\n309 \nThe CSC explained that Schedule C \naimed \u2018\u2018to enable the Administration to make appointments directly to those positions involving the determination of major executive policies\u2019\u2019 and identified the purpose of the new schedule for positions of a confidential or policy- determining character: \u2018\u2018This action was taken in order to make a clear distinction between jobs which belong in the career service and those which should be subject to change with a change in administration.\u2019\u2019\n310 \nAs commenter asserts, the Eisenhower \nAdministration recognized that the universe of political positions was small and showed restraint in redesignating or creating Schedule C positions. By mid- 1954, there were only 1,086 Schedule C \npositions.\n311This understanding about \nthe limited nature of this Schedule and corresponding restraint has endured to this day. \nThe precedent from 1936\u20131960 gave \nmeaning to the phrase \u2018\u2018confidential or policy-determining\u2019\u2019 by recognizing that it applied to political appointees and only a small number of positions. As commenter showed, Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter solidified that meaning by continuing to recognize the appropriate scope of the phrase \u2018\u2018confidential or policy-determining.\u2019\u2019 Under those five presidents, the number of confidential and policy-determining positions remained consistent, never exceeding 1,590 positions.\n312 \nBy the time Congress enacted the \nCSRA in 1978, the meaning of \u2018\u2018confidential or policy-determining\u2019\u2019 was firmly established as referring only to a small class of political positions. In enacting the CSRA, Congress opted for the slightly longer and more descriptive phrase \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- advocating.\u2019\u2019 But as commenter showed, the two phrases have always meant the same thing. \nCongressional deliberations over the \nCSRA exception for \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or \npolicy-advocating\u2019\u2019 positions reflected a contemporaneous understanding that the legislature\u2019s longer phrase referred to the same thing as the executive branch\u2019s shorter phrase.\n313During \nhearings on the bill that would become the CSRA, participants used the terms \u2018\u2018policy-determining,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018policy-making\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 interchangeably. Floor debate in the Senate, for example, discussed reports \nof the two Hoover Commissions,\n314 \ndemonstrating that Congress was aware of the history of the terms when it enacted the CSRA. The House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service issued a report in 1978 that showed congressional understanding and approval of the historical use of the \u2018\u2018confidential or policy-determining\u2019\u2019 exception, stating \u2018\u2018[a]n employee whose position is of a confidential or policy determining character, generally political appointees, would not be entitled to the benefits of this legislation.\u2019\u2019\n315The House Committee \ncontinued that the CSC \u2018\u2018issues regulations to define positions which are of a policy or confidential nature, and the committee believes the current regulatory definitions for these positions are adequate.\u2019\u2019 \nCommenter showed that the House of \nRepresentatives committee responsible for the CSRA explicitly indicated in its 1978 report that it meant for the new language, \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- advocating,\u2019\u2019 to cover only the types of positions that the executive branch had already included in Schedule C or designated as noncareer (i.e., politically \nappointed) executive positions.\n316 \nThis limitation, confining the \nlanguage to political appointees, was well understood after the CSRA\u2019s enactment as well. In 1990, when Congress amended 5 U.S.C. 7511 to grant nonpreference eligible employees a right to appeal removals and other major adverse actions to the MSPB, the relevant congressional committee was again clear in describing confidential and policy positions as political appointees.\n317 \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25023 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \ncoverage under section 7511(b) of title 5.

In 1992, a bipartisan group of senators \nand congressional representatives filed \nan amicus brief emphasizing that \u2018\u2018the effective synonym for confidential policy positions is \u2018political appointees.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n318Their brief cited an \nMSPB decision that had said the phrase was, \u2018\u2018after all, only a shorthand way of describing positions to be filled by so- called \u2018political appointees.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 \nComment 2134 also showed that, in \n1994, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics reaffirmed this common understanding. Following the enactment of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments, the committee issued guidance on a new prohibition applicable to members of Congress regarding personnel action recommendations or statements for \u2018\u2018all non-political Federal employment.\u2019\u2019 This meant that the prohibition did not apply to political appointments. The committee specifically noted that the prohibition did not apply to recommendations for presidential appointments or for positions determined to be of a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\u2019\u2019\n319The \ncommittee understood the term of art to mean political positions. \nFinally, commenter noted that OPM \nfurther affirmed the common understanding of this phrase when it responded to questions posed by Senator Christopher Shays (R\u2013CT) during a hearing in 1996. Illustrating the consistency of OPM\u2019s position on the meaning of the phrase it now defines, OPM wrote: \u2018\u2018OPM has authority to except positions from the competitive service on the basis that they are of a confidential or policy-making, policy- determining, or policy-advocating character (\u2018political\u2019 positions).\u2019\u2019\n320 \nCommenter concluded, correctly, that \nthis extensive history shows that the \u2018\u2018terms mean precisely what OPM\u2019s proposed definition says they mean. They describe positions meant to be filled by political appointees who have no expectation of continuing beyond the terms of either the president who appointed them or the term-limited presidential appointees they support.\u2019\u2019 The history also reveals there are few such positions. The number has remained steady at around 1,500 positions and has never exceeded 1,800 positions. \nOther Comments Regarding the History \nof the Exception \nSeveral other comments supportive of \nthe rule concurred with OPM\u2019s understanding that Congress intended the phrase \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- advocating\u2019\u2019 to mean political appointees. A labor union expressed that the clarification is consistent with the general understanding that the exception was intended to only cover political appointees and was not intended to extend to all federal employees whose jobs touch on policy in some way, which, if read broadly, could encompass a substantial portion of the federal civil service. Comment 40. The potential for turning the exception into one that \u2018\u2018eats the rule\u2019\u2019 is clear and the rule is a sensible approach to prevent such future abuses. Id. A \ncoalition of national and local unions agreed with OPM\u2019s contention that there has been a long, consistent understanding that this exception should encompass only a category of political appointees. Comment 41. \nComments Opposing this Regulatory \nChange \nAn advocacy nonprofit organization \nopposed to the rule argued that the legislative history for this exception merely confirms that it covers Schedule C political appointees. Comment 4097. But commenter contended that the legislative history does not state that the policy influencing exception covers only political appointments and excludes career employees. OPM disagrees with this position for the reasons detailed in the proposed rule, this final rule, and Comment 2134. Since at least 1936, this phrase and the resulting exception in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) have been understood to mean political appointees. Commenter cites nothing that counters this extensive record. Even if there were some uncertainty regarding the scope of section 7511(b)(2), OPM would adopt the same definition because it is the best reading of the statute, reflects the understanding articulated by Congress in enacting the CSRA and, as discussed throughout this preamble, reasonably reinforces and clarifies longstanding civil service protections and merit system principles. \nThe same commenter opposed to the \nrule argued that OPM\u2019s clarification of the longtime understanding of this exception would be unconstitutional. Comment 4097 argued that OPM \u2018\u2018does not appear to have considered the implications of its interpretation: accepting this construction would render many inferior officers\u2019 civil service protections unconstitutional.\u2019\u2019 For this, commenter again cited Free Enterprise Fund. For the reasons explained above in Sections III.(E), (F), OPM does not agree with this conclusion or that Free Enterprise Fund supports commenter\u2019s position. That case dealt with an independent agency with multiple layers of removal protections for their inferior officers (which generally do not exist in agencies where the President can remove a Secretary, Director, or other agency head at will). In Free Enterprise Fund, the second layer of protection was \nalso \u2018\u2018significant and unusual\u2019\u2019\n321and \nthe Court specifically said that other civil servants, like members of the SES, did not have such rigorous protections even when they worked in independent agencies, and further noted that many such employees would not qualify as constitutional officers. Free Enterprise Fund casts no doubt on the \nconstitutionality of the civil service within independent agencies and that decision provides no support to commenter\u2019s assertion that lower- ranking employees in all agencies must lose civil service rights if they work on policy or that somehow confirming their rights is unconstitutional. And commenter made no showing that career civil servants working on policy matters, especially below the ranks of the SES\u2014those to which this definition would apply\u2014are always, or by definition, inferior officers, nor is OPM aware of any judicial decisions holding so. \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25024 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n322Commenter argued \u2018\u2018Chapter 75 \u00a7 7511(c) says \nthat all Presidential appointees are exempt. \nHowever, other subsections enumerate other categories for exemption. Chapter 75 \u00a7 7511 (b)(2) outlines exemptions for policymaking employees. If Congress had intended that ONLY political appointees be exempt, they would not have outlined under what circumstances other employees would have been exempt for policymaking reasons. Therefore, Congressional intent was for there to be members of the civil service who are considered \u2018policymaking.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Comment 45. Commenter cited 5 U.S.C. 7511(c) but appears to mean 7511(b)(3). Also, OPM never argues that only political appointees are excepted from adverse action rights. It is defining the exception in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) to mean political appointees. \n323See supra note 138 (detailing the different \ntypes and numbers of political appointments). \n324See 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(1). \n325See 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(3). \n326See 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2).

See Comment 45. \nBut subsections 7511(b)(1)\u2013(3) exclude three distinct types of political appointments from the definition of \u2018\u2018employee,\u2019\u2019 and by extension, from adverse action rights.\n323The first \nexcludes high-level presidential appointees requiring Senate confirmation (PAS).\n324The third \nexcludes other presidential appointees \nwho do not require Senate confirmation.\n325The middle category, \nand the subject of this regulatory change, excludes those in positions determined to be of a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character\u2019\u2019\u2014 traditionally understood to refer, in the main, to Schedule C political appointees.\n326The creation of such a \nposition is approved in advance by OPM. Although the appointments are approved by the Presidential Personnel Office, the individuals selected are actually appointed by the head of the agency (or a designee) where the individual will be assigned. Section 7511(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Civil Service Due Process Amendments Act of 1990,\n327where Congress sought, \ninter alia, to eliminate the general exclusion of nonpreference eligible excepted-service employees from \u2018\u2018independent [MSPB] review.\u2019\u2019\n328 \nAccordingly, unlike the presidential appointees discussed in (b)(1) and \n(b)(3), which are automatically excluded from the adverse action procedures in chapter 75, some person or entity must make an affirmative determination whether a position in the excepted service is of a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating\u2019\u2019 character, a description which, as we have noted above, was consistent with Congress\u2019 understanding of the unique set of excepted service positions comprising Schedule C. Subparagraph (A) of section 7511(b)(2) specifies that any such determination must be made by the President, for a position that the President has excepted from the competitive service; subparagraph (B) specifies that any such determination must be made by OPM, for a position that OPM has excepted from the competitive service; and subparagraph (C) specifies that any such determination must be made by the President or the agency head for a position that Congress itself has excepted from the competitive service. As noted above, Congress explained that \u2018\u2018the key to the distinction between those to whom appeal rights are extended and those to whom such rights are not extended is the expectation of continuing employment with the Federal Government.\u2019\u2019 Congress stated that the bill that would become the Civil Service Due Process Amendments Act of 1990 \u2018\u2018explicitly denies procedural protections\u2019\u2019 to these types of political appointees\u2014\u2018\u2018presidential appointees, individuals in Schedule C positions [which are positions of a confidential or policy-making character] and individuals appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate,\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018[e]mployees in each of these categories have little expectation of continuing employment beyond the administration during which they were appointed\u2019\u2019 because they \u2018\u2018explicitly serve at the pleasure of the President or the presidential appointee who appointed them.\u2019\u2019\n329By enacting section \n7511(b)(3), therefore, Congress intended to exclude from the procedural and appeal rights of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 a discrete group of political appointees separate from those described in section 7511(b)(2), namely those individuals appointed directly by the President\n330 but who do not require Senate confirmation. \nSome commenters opposed to the rule \nargued that career civil servants, not just political appointees, can be \u2018\u2018policymakers\u2019\u2019 and excluded from the definition of \u2018\u2018employee\u2019\u2019 and stripped of rights under 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2). One former political appointee contended that career civil servants significantly impact policy in agencies across the Federal Government and that it makes little sense to say they are not policymakers. See Comment 45. \nComment 4097, an advocacy nonprofit organization, argued that the CSRA expressly applies the terms \u2018\u2018policy- determining\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018policy-making\u2019\u2019 to career positions. To support this point, commenter points to 5 U.S.C. 3132, which relates to the duties of both career and noncareer SES and states that SES members exercise \u2018\u2018important policy-making, policy-determining, or other executive functions.\u2019\u2019 5 U.S.C. 3132(2)(E). Commenter concludes similar phrasing in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) must also apply to career members of the competitive and excepted services. OPM disagrees, for multiple reasons. \nAs an initial matter, the terminology \nand the structure of 5 U.S.C. 7511(b) are different from 5 U.S.C. 3132. As explained extensively throughout this final rule, the phrase \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating,\u2019\u2019 as Congress used it in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2), is a term of art with a clear history and a consistent usage. By contrast, Congress, in enacting the provisions establishing the SES, was writing on a clean slate and used a different statutory structure and language. Section 3132(2)(E) describes the SES as exercising \u2018\u2018important policy- \nmaking, policy-determining, or other executive functions\u2019\u2019 (emphasis supplied), a new formulation of characteristics. Congress, in creating the SES, also established a different mechanism to provide flexibility for hiring a certain number of noncareer appointees, while limiting such appointments pursuant to a numerical \nformula.\n331 \nFurther, Comment 4097\u2019s comparison \nto language in the SES cuts against its larger argument\u2014that Congress contemplated that career civil servants, by the function of having confidential or policy responsibilities, can and should lose adverse action rights. As commenter points out, the law acknowledges that all SES positions, career and noncareer, \u2018\u2018exercise[ ] important policy-making, policy- determining, or other executive \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00044 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25025 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n332See 5 U.S.C. 7541\u20137543. \n333As explained, the exception at 5 U.S.C. \n7511(b)(2) does not apply to the SES. That \nexception applies to the excepted service and whether those civil servants have adverse action rights. But the excepted service does not include the SES. See 5 U.S.C. 2103(a) (defining \u2018\u2018excepted \nservice,\u2019\u2019 and stating, \u2018\u2018[f]or the purpose of this title, the \u2018excepted service\u2019 consists of those civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service.\u2019\u2019). \n334The Subchapter on adverse actions establishes \nthe at-will status of noncareer SES by simply defining \u2018\u2018employee\u2019\u2019 for purposes of that Subchapter as career employees, at section 7541(1)). Thus, there was no need, in crafting, sections 7541\u2013 7543, to make an exception similar to 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2), for positions of a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 character.\u2019\u2019 \n335See also 5 CFR 6.8(c) (moving USDA \nAgriculture Stabilization and Conservation state executive directors and Farmers Home Administration state directors into Schedule C). 336See 88 FR 63862, 63872. \n337Citing Special Counsel v.

See Comment 3953. \nCommenter argued that OPM\u2019s definition of the statutory exception fails to recognize that there is a significant number of career employees who exercise \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating\u2019\u2019 roles within the government. The rulemaking, commenter argued, therefore presumes a separation of policymaking and policy implementation and between political appointees and career officials that does not exist. As explained above, however, this final rule does not say that only political appointees should or do work on policy. Instead, it clarifies the longtime understanding of the exception in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) as political appointees. \nComment 4097 further argued that a \n1994 amendment to 5 U.S.C. 2302, relating to prohibited personnel practices, shows that career incumbents \u2018\u2018can lose statutory protections if their positions are declared policy- influencing.\u2019\u2019 Section 2302(a)(2)(B) defines \u2018\u2018covered position\u2019\u2019 with respect to any personnel action, but excludes from coverage any position which is, \u2018\u2018prior to the personnel action ...  excepted from the competitive service because of its confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating character.\u2019\u2019 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Commenter suggests that the 1994 amendment added \u2018\u2018prior to the personnel action\u2019\u2019 to this clause, and this means that Congress contemplated the designation of a position as confidential, policy-making, policy- determining, or policy-advocating and the subsequent removal of those positions as \u2018\u2018covered\u2019\u2019 under section 2302. That career incumbent, according to commenter, would then lose the corresponding protections from prohibited personnel practices after the \nposition\u2019s move to the excepted service. Section 2302(a)(2)(B) clarifies that the status of the underlying position at the time of the personnel action determines whether the incumbent can pursue relief pursuant to section 2302. OPM notes that this final rule deals with adverse action rights under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 and corresponding regulations, but not prohibited personnel practices. Adverse action protections and the ability to seek corrective action in response to a prohibited personnel practice are two separate types of rights with distinct processes. Nothing about the 1994 amendments change the meaning of the exclusion in section 7511(b)(2) as explained above. OPM, moreover, agrees that a select few employees have been moved from the competitive service to Schedule C because conditions of good administration warranted such a move, or have been placed in the excepted service by Congress, via a statute creating unique appointment and removal provisions, as in the Stanley cases.\n335But as these cases show, when \nit comes to adverse action rights, even the incumbents of confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating positions, when moved to Schedule C, retain previously accrued adverse action rights if the move was involuntary. \nComments Regarding the MSPB\u2019s \nInterpretation of This Exception \nOther commenters supporting the rule \ncontended that the MSPB has interpreted the phrase to mean political \nappointees. A coalition of national and local labor unions noted, as did OPM in its proposed rule,\n336that the MSPB has \nconstrued this phrase for decades. Comment 41. The Board has explained that the phrase \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- \nadvocating\u2019\u2019 is \u2018\u2018only a shorthand way of describing positions to be filled by so- called \u2018political appointees.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n337 \nOne commenter opposed to the rule \nargued that MSPB decisions have \u2018\u2018little relevance here\u2019\u2019 since chapter 75 gives the President, OPM, and agency heads responsibility for determining that positions are policy-influencing. Comment 4097. Commenter argued that MSPB case law does not and cannot determine the scope of these exceptions. The MSPB is authorized to hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Board.\n338Subject to \notherwise applicable provisions of law, it may take final action on any such matter.\n339It may order any Federal \nagency or employee to comply with any order or decision it issues and enforce compliance with any such order.\n340It is \ntrue that the MSPB cannot compel the Federal Circuit or the Supreme Court to adopt a different position, but MSPB\u2019s interpretations of title 5\u2019s terms are nevertheless significant. Where possible, it is prudent to interpret statutes harmoniously and in a manner that will not expose agencies to unwarranted liability. Also, as Comment 2134 described, Congress itself has relied on the MSPB decisions and viewed them as persuasive in defining terms in title 5. In 1992, a bipartisan group of senators and congressional representatives filed an amicus brief emphasizing that \u2018\u2018the effective synonym for confidential policy positions is \u2018political appointees.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 See Comment 2134. Their brief cited an MSPB decision that said the phrase was, \u2018\u2018after all, only a shorthand way of describing positions to be filled by so- called \u2018political appointees.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Id. OPM \nis not simply deferring to existing MSPB decisions, but rather has considered those decisions and finds their reasoning to be compelling and in accord with our own.

Off. of Indep. Counsel, 74 M.S.P.R. \n192, 206 (1997) (quoting Special Counsel, 31 \nM.S.P.R. at 231). 342The extension of all parts of this rule to the \nSES was a common request and theme in the comments. See Comments 2193, 2222, 2260, 2796, \n2816, 2822, 3049, 3095, 3149, 3687, 3973. term of art means only underscores the \npersuasiveness of that conclusion. \nFinally, a former political appointee \nargued that \u2018\u2018policy-making\u2019\u2019 under 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) is not determined by how employees are hired\u2014as a political appointee or career civil servant\u2014but rather, it is determined based on holding an excepted position. Comment 45. Under 5 U.S.C. 3302, however, excepted service positions can be created for a variety of reasons when conditions of good administration warrant. The President has delegated to OPM\u2014and, before that, to its predecessor, the CSC\u2014concurrent authority to except positions from the competitive service when it determines that appointments thereto through competitive examination are not practicable. Merely holding an excepted service position does not make someone a policy-making employee nor does working on policy necessitate being in an excepted service. \nAs Congress described during the \n1990 Amendments, the \u2018\u2018key to the distinction\u2019\u2019 between those civil servants on whom appeal rights are conferred and those to whom such rights are not conferred is the \u2018\u2018expectation of continuing employment with the Federal Government.\u2019\u2019 Some commenters opposed to this rule ignore this distinction. Comment 4097 argued that certain employees would not enjoy adverse action rights but would keep their jobs if they \u2018\u2018faithfully advanced the President\u2019s agenda.\u2019\u2019 Such a scheme would be directly contrary to this \u2018\u2018key\u2019\u2019 distinction that Congress identified as animating the adverse action exceptions. \nImproperly applying the phrase \n\u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 to describe positions held by career employees, who have an expectation of continuing employment beyond the presidential administration during which they were appointed, and to strip them of civil service protections, even when the Senior Executives to whom such individuals report retain protections, would be inconsistent with the statute. OPM\u2019s rule, on the contrary, is the best reading of the statute\u2014as confirmed by the statutory scheme, congressional intent, legislative history, and decades of applicable case law and \npractice. Congress carefully balanced the need for long-term employees who have knowledge of the history, mission, and operations of their agencies with the need of the President for individuals in certain positions who will ensure that the specific policies of the Administration will be pursued. The phrase has long been interpreted as \u2018\u2018a shorthand way of describing positions \nto be filled by political appointees,\u2019\u2019 including any appointment required or authorized to be made by the President, or by an agency head when there are \u2018\u2018indications that the appointment was intended to be, or in fact was, made with any political considerations in mind.\u2019\u2019\n341In this final rule, therefore, \nOPM is making explicit this longtime, consistent understanding. \nOPM is promulgating the following \nchanges to 5 CFR parts 210, 213, 432, 451, and 752: \nPart 210\u2014Basic Concepts and \nDefinitions (General) \nSubpart A\u2014Applicability of \nRegulations; Definitions \nSection 210.102 Definitions \nThe final rule amends 5 CFR 210.102 \nto add a definition for the phrase \n\u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018confidential or policy- determining\u2019\u2019 to describe positions generally excepted from chapter 75\u2019s protections to reinforce the longstanding interpretation that, in creating this exception to 5 U.S.C. 7511(b), Congress intended to except noncareer political appointments from the civil service protections, which are identified by their close working relationship with the President, head of an agency, or other key appointed officials who are responsible for furthering the goals and policies of the President and the administration, and that carry no expectation of continued employment beyond the presidential administration during which the appointment occurred. OPM defines the phrase as descriptors for the positions held by noncareer political employees because the phrase is currently used in the regulations to describe, among other things, a \u2018\u2018position\u2019\u2019 or the \u2018\u2018character\u2019\u2019 of a position. \nOPM also conforms changes to 5 CFR \n213.3301, 302.101, 432.101, 451.302, 752.201, and 752.401 to standardize the phrasing used to describe this type of position. Additional comments related to this definition are addressed here. \nComments Regarding Amendments to 5 \nCFR 210.102 \nAn oversight nonprofit organization \nsupportive of this rule suggested that it would be improved if OPM provided a list of the positions that do not meet the definition of \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3894. This commenter was especially concerned that OPM enumerate the non- confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, and policy-advocating positions involving national security, public health, emergency management, whistleblower protection, government ethics, audits, legal and regulatory \ninterpretation, budget development and execution, medical and scientific research, and data collection and analysis. Commenter suggested that an explicit enumeration is necessary to ensure that the appropriate positions in critical areas are not mistakenly categorized as confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating. OPM will not make revisions based on this comment. OPM has adequately and thoroughly clarified the exception in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) by explaining that it applies to noncareer political appointees. It would be impracticable for OPM to effectively enumerate all such political positions, especially since new positions may be created over time. OPM also notes that a (necessarily partial) list of positions that do not meet the definition may be \nmisunderstood as an attempt at an exhaustive list, generating confusion rather than clarity. \nSeveral commenters requested that \nOPM clarify how the definition of \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 in this final rule applies, if at all, to the members of the SES.\n342Comments 44, a \npublic service nonprofit organization, and 3687, a science advocacy organization, asked that OPM clarify how this definition affects SES employees. Comment 763, a management association, expressed concern that OPM\u2019s clarification of these types of positions will lead to SES employees getting cut out of their current policy supporting roles. They recommended that OPM define \u2018\u2018policy determining, making, and advocating\u2019\u2019 as covering issues that rise to a level needing decisions by Presidential appointees. They further recommended that OPM address how our proposed amendments to 5 CFR part 210 interact with the statutes and regulations governing the SES and other senior career leaders that make clear that career SES are involved in many policy- related activities, explicitly including support for policy advocacy.

Congress established the SES as a separate service \u2018\u2018to ensure that the executive management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality for executive-level Federal employees.\u2019\u2019\n344The SES has a \ndifferent system for hiring executives, managing them, and compensating them.\n345It provides for both career and \nnoncareer positions and sets its own limitations on the appointment of noncareer positions. Career SES employees are governed by separate adverse action procedures. Because, pursuant to the definitions in 5 U.S.C. 7541, those adverse actions are limited to \u2018\u2018career\u2019\u2019 employees, there was no need, unlike with the rules governing adverse actions for employees in the General Schedule, to call out and exclude positions of \u2018\u2018a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character,\u2019\u2019 and thus there is no reference to such positions in the provisions at section 7541\u20137543. \nInstead, chapter 75\u2019s adverse action \nprocedures for the SES, codified at 5 U.S.C. 7543, indisputably apply to any \ncareer appointee in the SES who has completed the relevant probationary period in the SES or had accrued adverse action protections while serving in the competitive or excepted services prior to joining the SES.\n346Accordingly, \neven though SES employees engage in important policy-related work, the phrase \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- \nadvocating character,\u2019\u2019 as used to describe positions that are excepted from chapter 75\u2019s adverse action protections, does not apply to the SES. \nFurther, in addition to providing \nexplicit adverse action protections for career SES, Congress also sought to protect and preserve a career SES free from undue partisan political influence in other ways, including by setting strict limits on the number of SES positions that could be designated as \u2018\u2018noncareer\u2019\u2019 (i.e., political).\n347The rules are clear: \nthe number of noncareer SES in any agency is to be determined annually by OPM, not by the agency; \u2018\u2018the total number of noncareer appointees in all agencies may not exceed 10 percent of the total number of Senior Executive Service positions in all agencies\u2019\u2019; and the number of noncareer SES in any single agency may not be more than \u2018\u201825 percent of the total number of Senior Executive Service positions in the agency\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018the number of [certain executive and Executive Schedule] positions in the agency which were filled on the date of the enactment of\u2019\u2019 the CSRA.\n348There are also limits on \nthe number of emergency and limited- term SES appointments. The governmentwide total may not exceed 5 \npercent of the governmentwide total of all SES.\n349 \nAs discussed above, any suggestion \nthat Congress provided more protections for SES employees who work on policy than it did for competitive and excepted service employees who work on policy would make little sense within the statutory scheme. Members of the SES make up the most senior ranks of the civil service beneath the presidential appointment level. They work most directly with the President\u2019s political appointees. They have managerial authority over employees in the competitive and excepted services. This includes the ability to direct their work and hold them accountable for poor performance or misconduct. A system that provided greater protections to its senior executives than it does to its rank-and-file employees would be ineffective and impractical. \nAnother commenter expressed \nconcern that the proposed definition would lead to a reduction in the responsibilities of current positions, and a reclassification of those positions into the excepted service. Comment 2445 (an individual), see also Comment 763 \n(management association, expressing concern about career staff who support the policy development process through their work but do not have confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions). Comment 2445 suggested that OPM clarify that some confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating work may be delegated without changing the character of the delegee\u2019s position. The comment also suggested that OPM clarify that duties typically performed by those in competitive service positions are not confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating. OPM will not make revisions based on these comments. OPM will clarify though, as described above, that OPM acknowledges and understands that career employees across government touch, support, and otherwise work on policy. This final rule in no way suggests that only political appointees do or should work on policy. Instead, the purpose of this rule is much more specific\u2014to clarify the meaning of the exception to adverse action rights in section 7511(b)(2)\u2014 which, as explained, is a term of art that has long meant political appointees. \nFinally, one individual encouraged \nOPM to define positions of a \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 character as narrowly as possible. Comment 920. OPM will not make revisions based on this comment. OPM notes that the definition adopted accords with Congressional intent, legislative history, and past practices and is the best reading of the statute. The comment also suggested that OPM add additional protections to prevent positions from being moved into Schedule C and to prevent the creation of a new schedule of political appointees. OPM will not make revisions based on this comment. The President has the authority to create excepted service schedules and except positions where necessary and if conditions of good administrations warrant such exceptions. What this rule is addressing is the retention of accrued status and rights following an involuntary move to or within the excepted service and a clarification of when the exception of 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2) applies. \nPart 213\u2014Excepted Service \nPart 213 sets forth provisions for \npositions and appointments in the \nexcepted service.

Defendant cites as the enacted expression of this [opposition] the annual prohibition against appropriated funds of the CSC being used for the Commission\u2019s Legal Examining Unit.

As with the adverse action rules in part 752, the rules applicable to performance-based actions apply broadly to employees in the competitive and excepted services, with specific exceptions that include political appointees. The final rule amends 5 CFR 432.102 to make clear that employees in positions determined to be of a confidential policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character as defined in 5 CFR 210.102 are excluded from coverage under part 432, consistent with congressional intent. \nComments Regarding Changes to 5 CFR \n432.102 \nAn agency expressed the view that \npart 752 would provide \u2018\u2018coverage to employees who are involuntarily moved into roles in the excepted service that have confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\u2019\u2019 as described in Section IV(A) and then requested that part 432 be treated similarly by revising the exclusion at 5 CFR 432.102(f)(10). See Comment 2766. OPM will accept the agency\u2019s recommendation for the same reasons it adopted similar suggested revisions to part 752 and will revise section 432.102(f)(10) by adding \u2018\u2018unless the incumbent was moved involuntarily to such a position after accruing rights as delineated in paragraph (e) of this section.\u2019\u2019 \nPart 451\u2014Awards \nSection 451.302 Ranks for Senior \nCareer Employees \nPart 451 applies to awards and 5 CFR \n451.302 addresses ranks for senior career employees. OPM is amending 5 CFR 451.302 to conform to the revised 5 CFR 210.102. This amendment standardizes the phrasing used to describe this type of position. \nOPM received no comments \nspecifically about the regulatory changes to 5 CFR 451.302, sees no reason to amend the proposal, and will finalize the language as proposed. \nC. Agency Procedures for Moving \nEmployees \nOPM revises 5 CFR part 302 \n(Employment in the Excepted Service) to require that Federal agencies follow \nspecific procedures upon moving positions from the competitive service to the excepted service or, if the position is already in the excepted service, to a different excepted service schedule following a direction from the President, Congress, OPM, or their \ndesignees (hereinafter, \u2018\u2018a directive\u2019\u2019).\n350 \nThis final rule sets the procedures an agency must follow before taking these actions, outlines the notice requirements that apply when the positions are encumbered, and provides a right of appeal to the MSPB to the extent any such move is involuntary and characterized as stripping individuals of any previously accrued civil service status and protections. OPM discusses the public comments related to these provisions in turn. \n1. Procedures for Moving Positions \nIn enacting the CSRA, Congress made \ncertain findings relevant to the changes \ndiscussed here. It noted that the merit system principles, many of which have existed since 1883,\n351\u2018\u2018shall govern in \nthe competitive service\u2019\u2019 and that these principles and the prohibited personnel practices should be \u2018\u2018expressly stated\u2019\u2019 in statute to \u2018\u2018furnish guidance to Federal agencies.\u2019\u2019\n352As explained \npreviously, Congress then proceeded to divide functions previously performed by the CSC among OPM, the MSPB, and OSC. It found that the function of filling positions in the Executive Branch should be delegated to agencies \u2018\u2018in appropriate cases\u2019\u2019 but that OPM should maintain control and oversight \u2018\u2018to protect against prohibited personnel practices and the use of unsound management practices by the agencies.\u2019\u2019\n353 \nOPM has concluded that imposing \nadditional safeguards when agencies move positions from one service to another, or one excepted service schedule to another, will help OPM determine whether appointments to the competitive service are \u2018\u2018not practicable,\u2019\u2019\n354protect against \nprohibited personnel practices, secure appropriate enforcement of the laws governing the civil service, and avoid \nunsound management practices with respect to the civil service. It is important to the effective administration of the civil service that exceptions from the competitive service norm be enforced within the terms of the specific authority creating them and that employees who are said to have voluntarily accepted positions that affect their rights share the same understanding as their agencies and are aware of the potential consequences of \nthose moves. \nSome background demonstrates why \nthese changes are important. Positions in the Federal Government are, by default, placed in the competitive service. As noted by the D.C. Circuit, 5 U.S.C. 3301 and 3302 \u2018\u2018make it clear . . . that \u2018competitive service [is] the norm rather than the exception.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n355 \nThe President, however, is authorized by Congress to provide for \u2018\u2018necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service\u2019\u2019 whenever warranted by \u2018\u2018conditions of good administration.\u2019\u2019\n356The President, in \nturn, has delegated to OPM the authority to except positions from the competitive service, which means either the President or OPM may except positions, as situations warrant.\n357It has \nbeen a longstanding practice under these authorities for the President, and for OPM exercising its delegated authority, to permit positions that would otherwise be in the competitive service to be filled through excepted service appointments where conditions of good administration warrant exceptions from competitive examining procedures (e.g., for people with \ndisabilities and students). In some cases, positions have been placed in the excepted service because it is not practicable to examine for the position. For example, a perennial rider to OPM appropriations prohibits OPM\u2014and before that, its predecessor CSC\u2014from examining for attorney positions.\n358 \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25029 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \nOctober 10, 1978, Pub.

By E.O. 9830, 12 FR 1259 (1947), the President in s 6.1 provided that positions in Schedule A and B should be excepted from the competitive service. Section 6.4 is Schedule A. Item IV therein is \u2018attorneys.\u2019 Whether the legislative intent is obvious to \u2018outsiders,\u2019 it certainly has been to the Executive branch, which has never, since \nMay 1, 1947, put attorney positions anywhere but in the excepted service.\u2019\u2019). \n359Fiorentino, 607 F.2d at 965\u201366. \n360See 5 U.S.C. 3302; see also Nat\u2019l Treasury \nEmployees Union v.

In practice, this standard has been held to be satisfied by using veterans\u2019 preference as a plus factor, and thus a tie- breaker, in comparing candidates at similar levels of knowledge, skills, and abilities.

CHCOs advise and assist in carrying out agencies\u2019 responsibilities for selecting, developing, training, and managing a high-quality, \nproductive workforce in accordance with merit system principles. See 5 U.S.C. 1401\u20131402. They \nare also responsible for \u2018\u2018implement[ing] the rules and regulations of the President, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the laws governing the civil service within an agency.\u2019\u2019 5 CFR 250.202. OPM has delegated various responsibilities directly to CHCOs. See, e.g., U.S. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., \u2018\u2018Personnel Management in Agencies\u2019\u2019 81 FR 89357 (Dec. 12, 2016) (tasking CHCOs with developing a Human Capital Operating Plan); U.S. Off. of Pers.

This appropriations bar makes \nexaminations not practicable, and attorney positions have been placed in Schedule A of the excepted service since at least 1947.\n359See Comment \n2134 (detailing history of federal attorneys in the competitive service and Congress\u2019 bar of attorney examinations resulting in Schedule A). In all these cases, OPM is subject to the standard that any departure must be compelled by conditions of good administration.\n360 \nTraditionally, the President has \nexercised his authority to except General Schedule positions from the competitive service through executive orders.\n361OPM has also authorized \nexcepted service hiring to address urgent needs of agencies,\n362such as the \nneed to bring on staff quickly to respond to the COVID\u201319 pandemic.\n363When \nOPM exercises such authority, it determines that the characteristics of the position make it impracticable to use the processes associated with conducting a competitive examination.\n364For example, it may be \nthat the qualification requirements established for competitive service positions cannot be used because the series has been newly created. In other instances, OPM determines that open competition is not conducive to filling certain positions quickly because the applicant pool is narrow. \nSometimes, excepted service \ndeterminations are prescriptive, and agencies need only execute the operational tasks necessary to implement the direction of the President or OPM (for example, Schedule A attorneys, Schedule E administrative \nlaw judges, or any number of other positions specifically identified for excepted service status, such as through Executive Orders 5560 and 6655). In other circumstances, either the President or OPM establishes standards and conditions for agencies to apply in deciding which positions should be moved\u2014either temporarily or permanently into the excepted service (for example, Schedule D appointments for students and recent graduates and Schedule A appointments related to the COVID\u201319 pandemic). In the latter category, the determination of whether to place a position in the excepted service has typically occurred prior to the position being filled. In other words, with the notable exceptions of Schedule E, established by Executive Order 13843,\n365and of the prior Schedule F, \nestablished by the now-revoked Executive Order 13957, these are intended to be used as hiring authorities. It is notable that, in the case of the creation of Schedule E, the President remarked that the exigency presented by pending litigation was one of the motivations, and expressly provided that incumbents who were in the competitive service as of the date of enactment would remain in the competitive service as long as they remained in their current positions.\n366 \nWhen the President or OPM has \nchosen to establish standards for agencies to apply in creating new positions or moving existing positions into the excepted service (rather than specifically directing that certain positions be excepted service positions), they have also routinely required agencies to follow certain procedures subject to OPM oversight. \nThe Pathways programs, originally \nestablished by President Barack Obama in Executive Order 13562, is a good example. Under 5 CFR part 362, agencies seeking to use the Pathways programs to hire students and recent graduates into excepted service positions must adhere to various policies and procedures. There are rules governing how agencies must use the Pathways programs as part of a larger workforce planning effort, specifying procedures that are conditions of the agency\u2019s use of the programs, identifying how Pathways positions are to be announced, and setting parameters for eligibility for the programs.\n367OPM \nhas the authority to cap Pathways hiring368and can even shut down an \nagency\u2019s ability to use Pathways \naltogether.369 \nBased on this history and experience, \nOPM proposed and is now establishing appropriate safeguards\u2014i.e., a floor of \nprocedures\u2014that would apply whenever an agency is executing discretion to move any position or positions from the competitive service to the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another, under authority exercised by the President, Congress, OPM, or their designees. In each instance, the agency would have to adhere to the following procedures: \n1. Identify the types, numbers, and \nlocations of the employee(s) or position(s) that the agency proposes to move into or within the excepted service; \n2. Document the basis for its \ndetermination that movement of the employee(s) or position(s) is consistent with the standards set forth by the President, Congress, OPM, or their designees, as applicable; \n3. Obtain certification from the \nagency\u2019s Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO)\n370that the documentation is \nsufficient and movement of the employee(s) or position(s) is both consistent with the standards set forth by the President, Congress, OPM, or their designees, as applicable, and advances sound merit system principles; \n4. Submit the CHCO certification and \nsupporting documentation to OPM (to include the types, numbers, and locations of the employee(s) or position(s)) in advance of using the excepted service authority; \n5. Use the excepted service authority \nonly after obtaining written approval from the OPM Director to do so; and \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25030 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n3715 U.S.C. 1103(a)(5). \n3725 CFR 5.1, 6.1, 6.2. \n3735 CFR 5.4. 3745 U.S.C. 3302; 5 CFR 6.1. \n375Horner, supra note 149, 854 F.2d at 495. 376See Section IV(B). 6. Initiate any hiring actions under the \nexcepted service authority only after \nOPM publishes any such authorizations in the Federal Register, to include the types, numbers, and locations of the positions moved to the excepted service. \nComments Regarding the Implications \nof This Regulatory Change \nMost of the comments regarding these \nchanges were supportive, but some, including a former political appointee, argued that creating further procedures impedes the President\u2019s ability to act with his constitutionally vested authority over the Executive Branch and its functions. See Comment 45. \nCommenter also argued that \u2018\u2018Congress has granted the President the authority to move Federal employees. This rule seeks to impede this authority.\u2019\u2019 As noted in Section III(F), the CSRA, as codified, imposed upon OPM both \nauthority and an obligation to, among other things, \u2018\u2018execut[e], administer[ ], and enforce[ ] . . . the civil service rules and regulations of the President and the Office and the laws governing the civil service.\u2019\u2019\n371 \nWe will not make any changes as a \nresult of this comment. The President, pursuant to his own authorities under the CSRA, as codified at 5 U.S.C. 3301 and 3302, has also delegated a variety of these authorities to OPM concerning execution, administration, and enforcement of the competitive and excepted services. Among other things, the President has authorized OPM to \u2018\u2018promulgate and enforce regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the Civil Service Act and the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, as reenacted in title 5, United States Code, the Civil Service Rules, and all other statutes and Executive orders imposing responsibilities on the Office,\u2019\u2019\n372and \nto collect information and records regarding matters falling within the civil service laws, rules, and regulations.\n373 \nOPM has acted pursuant to these authorities to create government-wide rules for Federal employees regarding a broad range of topics, such as hiring, promotion, performance assessment, pay, leave, political activity, retirement, and health benefits. Both the President and OPM also establish standards and conditions for agencies to apply in deciding which positions should be moved from the competitive into the excepted service. This rule is squarely within these authorities. \nAlso, while the President can create \nexcepted service schedules and move positions into the excepted service, that \nability is not unqualified. For instance, Congress has mandated that exceptions occur only when \u2018\u2018necessary\u2019\u2019 and warranted by \u2018\u2018conditions of good administration.\u2019\u2019\n374Although the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) does not apply to the President, it is applicable to OPM and the agencies that implement directions from the President \nor OPM. The D.C. Circuit has determined, for purposes of challenges under the APA, that \u2018\u2018several provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code, viewed together, provide a meaningful\u2014not a rigorous, but neither a meaningless\u2014 standard against which to judge\u2019\u2019 a decision to except positions from the competitive service, when it is OPM that creates the exception.\n375If \ndeterminations by agencies or OPM that certain positions belong in a newly- created excepted service schedule would similarly be reviewable, it is prudent for OPM to establish procedural regularity into this process. \nFinally, this rule does not restrict the \nPresident\u2019s authorities. These procedures, which establish uniform processes when agencies move positions or people, will help OPM determine whether appointments to the competitive service are \u2018\u2018not practicable,\u2019\u2019 protect against prohibited personnel practices, secure appropriate enforcement of the law governing the civil service, and avoid unsound management practices with respect to the civil service. \nOPM is promulgating the following \nchanges to 5 CFR part 302: \nPart 302\u2014Employment in the Excepted \nService \nPart 302 governs employment in the \nexcepted service, including the procedures an agency must follow when an employee serving under a nontemporary appointment is selected for an excepted appointment. The authority citation provided in the proposed rule did not reflect changes made by the Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs final rule published on September 1, 2023 (88 FR 60317). The updated authority citation is reflected in this final rule. \nSection 302.101 Positions Covered by \nRegulations \nThis section describes positions \ncovered by part 302. OPM is amending 5 CFR 302.101 to conform to the revised 5 CFR 210.102, which adds a definition to the phrases \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018confidential or policy- \ndetermining.\u2019\u2019\n376 \nSubpart F\u2014Moving Employees and Positions Into and Within the Excepted Service \nOPM adds subpart F titled, \u2018\u2018Moving \nEmployees and Positions Into and Within the Excepted Service.\u2019\u2019 In the event of a directive by the President, Congress, OPM, or their designees, to \nmove employee(s) or position(s) from the competitive service to the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another, this new subpart describes the processes and procedures an agency must follow to carry out such a move. \nSection 302.601 \u2018\u2018Scope\u2019\u2019 \nThis subsection describes the scope of \nthe positions that would be subject to \nthe new procedures in subpart F. \nComments Regarding Amendments to 5 \nCFR 302.601 \nComment 2134, a joint comment by a \nnonprofit organization and former federal official, supported the rule but suggested that 5 CFR 302.601 be revised for clarity. Commenter noted that the proposed rule clearly covered the movement of positions into an excepted service schedule but was unclear about the involuntary movement of employees from their current positions to other positions in an excepted service schedule. Commenter suggested a revision to make clear that the movement of employees, not just positions, falls within the scope of Subpart F. OPM agrees with this comment and has revised this provision accordingly. \nOne intended purpose of Subpart F is \nto regulate the movement of positions to and within the excepted service. But covering the movement of employees is an important feature of the subpart. For instance, section 302.602(c) requires that agencies that seek to move an encumbered position into or within the excepted service notify affected employees of the movement and relevant rights. Covering both employees and positions in this regulatory scheme is important because, once a position is filled by an incumbent, that incumbent gains certain rights and status over time as detailed in 5 U.S.C. 7511(a) and as explained in Section IV(A). And once those rights and status accrue, the employee retains those rights upon a move to or within the excepted service so long as the moves, however many they may be or into whichever positions they may be, \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25031 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n377Commenter also suggests that we include \nregulatory language addressing accrued civil service \nprotections under 5 U.S.C. chapter 23, relating to merit system principles and prohibited personnel practices, in addition to those accrued under chapter 75. As explained above, this final rule deals with adverse action rights under chapter 75 and corresponding regulations, but not prohibited personnel practices. Adverse action protections and the ability to seek corrective action in response to a prohibited personnel practices are two separate types of rights with distinct processes. Also, OPM notes that 5 U.S.C. 2302 addresses certain prohibited personnel actions with respect to \u2018\u2018covered\u2019\u2019 positions, rather than rights \u2018\u2018accrued\u2019\u2019 by individuals over time. \n3785 U.S.C. 3395. 3795 U.S.C. 3592. \n3805 U.S.C. 3594. are involuntary. In this way, both \npositions and employees are covered by this regulatory amendment. \nOPM will modify the regulatory \nlanguage to clarify this point. The revised language at 5 CFR 302.601 will state that the subpart applies to any situation where an agency moves\u2014(1) a position from the competitive service to the excepted service, or between excepted services, whether pursuant to statute, Executive order, or an OPM issuance, to the extent that this subpart is not inconsistent with applicable statutory provisions; or (2) an employee who has accrued status and civil service protections under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75,\n377subchapter II, involuntarily to any \nposition that is not covered by that chapter or subchapter. It will also explain that the subpart applies in situations where a position previously governed by title 5, U.S. Code, will be governed by another title of the U.S. Code going forward, unless the statute governing the exception provides otherwise. \nAnother commenter, a former federal \nofficial, suggested that OPM revise Subpart F to include movement of positions from the career-reserved SES into the excepted service. See Comment \n2816. For the reasons described in the previous sections, OPM will not adopt these suggestions. The SES, as noted above, is not in the excepted service and is governed by a separate statutory structure that addresses access to adverse action protections by type of appointment. The statute expressly provides for \u2018\u2018career\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018noncareer\u2019\u2019 positions. But an \u2018\u2018employee,\u2019\u2019 for purposes of the SES adverse action provisions, is defined as a \u2018\u2018career\u2019\u2019 employee. Accordingly, the adverse action provisions, which apply only to career employees, contain no explicit exclusions, akin to section 7511(b)(2), based upon the character of the position. Moreover, the provisions governing the SES directly address reassignments and transfers of career \nsenior executives,\n378removal of a career \nemployee from the SES into a civil service position outside of the SES during probation or as a result of less than fully successful executive performance,\n379and the circumstances \nin which there may be guaranteed placement in other personnel systems for a senior executive who has been removed from the SES.\n380 \nSection 302.602(a) \u2018\u2018Basic Requirements\u2019\u2019 \nThis section requires an agency to \ntake certain steps after a directive from the President, Congress, OPM or their designees to move a position or positions from the competitive service to the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another. This final rule establishes additional procedural requirements that apply when one or more of the positions the agency seeks to move is encumbered by an employee. \nSection 302.602(a)(1) states that, if the \ndirective explicitly delineates the specific positions that are covered, the agency need only list the positions moved in accordance with that directive, and their location within the organization and provide the list to OPM. \nSection 302.602(a)(2) states that, if the \ndirective requires the agency to select the positions to be moved pursuant to criteria articulated in the directive, then the agency must provide OPM with a list of the positions to be moved in accordance with those criteria, those positions\u2019 location in the organization, and, upon request from OPM, an explanation of how the positions met those criteria. \nSection 302.602(a)(3) states that, if the \ndirective confers discretion on the agency to establish objective criteria for identifying the positions to be covered, or which specific slots of a particular type of position the agency intends to move, then the agency must, in addition to supplying a list, supply OPM with the locations in the organization, the objective criteria to be used, and an explanation of how these criteria are relevant. \nSection 302.602(b) describes the steps \nagency management must take, independent of the impacted employees, with respect to such moves. \nSection 302.602(b)(1) requires an \nagency to identify the types, numbers, and locations of positions that the agency proposes to move into the excepted service. \nSection 302.602(b)(2) requires the \nagency to document the basis for its determination that movement of the positions is consistent with the \nstandards set forth by the President, Congress, OPM, or their designees as applicable. \nSection 302.602(b)(3) requires the \nagency to obtain certification from the agency\u2019s CHCO that the documentation is sufficient and movement of the positions is both consistent with the standards set forth by the President, Congress, OPM, or their designees as applicable, and with merit system principles. \nSection 302.602(b)(4) requires the \nagency to submit the CHCO certification and supporting documentation to OPM (to include the types, numbers, and locations of positions) in advance of using the excepted service authority. \nSection 302.602(b)(5) specifies that \nOPM shall then review the CHCO certification and supporting documentation, and the agency shall be able to use the excepted service authority only after obtaining written approval from the OPM Director to do so. \nSection 302.602(b)(6) specifies that \nOPM shall publish any such authorizations in the Federal Register, to include the types, numbers, and locations of the positions moved to the excepted service and that the agency is \nnot permitted to initiate any hiring actions under the excepted service authority until such publication occurs. \nComments Regarding Amendments to 5 \nCFR 302.602(a) and (b) \nComment 2134 proposed several \nchanges to OPM\u2019s proposed addition of section 302.602. Commenter correctly noted that in paragraph (a)(1), the second instance of the word \u2018\u2018list\u2019\u2019 (following \u2018\u2018in accordance with that\u2019\u2019) is a mistake. OPM meant to write \u2018\u2018directive\u2019\u2019 instead and will adopt this suggestion. Paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) require that agencies provide a list or lists of the positions to be moved, the locations in the organization, the objective criteria to be used, and an explanation of how these criteria are relevant. Commenter is correct that the list or lists should be provided to OPM. and OPM will make that clear in the final regulatory language. Paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) require agencies to \u2018\u2018Identify\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Document\u2019\u2019 certain information, respectively. Commenter asserted it is not clear how agencies are to accomplish the identification and documentation and suggested adding \u2018\u2018in a report to OPM\u2019\u2019 after the words \u2018\u2018Identify\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Document\u2019\u2019 in these paragraphs. OPM will not adopt this suggestion. OPM believes the reporting is implicit in the certification by the CHCO and the accompanying data and \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00051 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25032 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n381Commenter also suggests that we include \nregulatory language addressing accrued civil service \nprotections under 5 U.S.C. chapter 23, but for the reasons discussed in note 377, we decline to do so. 382See 5 U.S.C. 1401\u20131402. \n3835 CFR 250.202. lists. OPM will consider providing \nfurther instructions about the forms this information should take in guidance and will also consider providing templates. For the reasons discussed above regarding suggested revisions to section 302.601, commenter also suggested expanding the coverage of \nsection 302.602 to include not only the movement of positions but also the movement of individual employees by adding a new subsection (d) that reads: \u2018\u2018In addition to applying to the movement of positions, the requirements of this section apply to the involuntary movement of competitive service or excepted service employees who have accrued status or civil service protections under 5 U.S.C. [ ] chapter 75, subchapter II, to positions that are not covered by such chapter or subchapter.\u2019\u2019 OPM will adopt this suggestion for the same reasons it adopted the similar suggestion regarding section 302.601.\n381 \nOPM will modify this suggestion so that subsection (d) reads: \u2018\u2018In addition to applying to the movement of positions, the requirements of this section apply to the involuntary movement of competitive service or excepted service employees with respect to any earned competitive status, any accrued procedural rights, or depending on the action involved, any appeal rights under chapter 75, subchapter II, or section 4303 of title 5, United States Code, even when moved to the new positions.\u2019\u2019 \nCommenter then suggested that OPM \nconsider increasing transparency by ensuring that the public has access to the information discussed in section 302.602. To enforce any such transparency requirement, commenter suggested that OPM provide that personnel actions implementing the movement of positions or employees will be ineffective until 90 days after the release of this information to the public. This period, commenter argued, would also provide Congress an opportunity to conduct meaningful oversight in the event of a major upheaval of civil service processes and protections. OPM believes that the processes in this final rule already strike the appropriate balance among a variety of factors, including transparency, the preservation of merit, and good governance while also allowing for the efficiency and flexibility to conduct normal government operations governed by statute, which can include reorganizations or moving positions to or within the excepted service if necessary and warranted by conditions \nof good administration. Further, the presentation of information as described in this subpart may lead to communications between OPM and an agency that would generally be protected by the privilege afforded to the deliberative process. OPM will not adopt these suggestions. \nFinally, this commenter suggested \nthat because section 302.602 refers to the movement of \u2018\u2018positions\u2019\u2019 and uses other plural words, this section might be construed to be inapplicable in the case of the movement of only one employee or position. OPM agrees and will add a new subsection (e) that reads: Notwithstanding the use of the plural words \u2018\u2018positions,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018employees,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018personnel actions,\u2019\u2019 this section also applies if the directive of the President, Congress, OPM, or a designee thereof affects only one position or one individual. \nAnother commenter supportive of the \nrule suggested that OPM shift documentation and other duties under section 302.602(b)(3) from agency human resources to Department-level human resources or OPM. Comment 6. OPM will not make revisions based on this comment. A CHCO is well positioned to certify the sufficiency of an agency\u2019s documentation pursuant to section 302.602(b). By law, CHCOs advise and assist in carrying out agencies\u2019 responsibilities for selecting, developing, training, and managing a high-quality, productive workforce in accordance with merit system principles.\n382They are responsible for \n\u2018\u2018implement[ing] the rules and regulations of the President, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the laws governing the civil service within an agency.\u2019\u2019\n383They are also \nexperienced with these types of duties because OPM has delegated various similar responsibilities directly to CHCOs in the past. Commenter also suggested that the rule require agencies, Departments, and OPM to consult with \nbargaining units and unions concerning the effects of the movement of a position on bargaining unit employees, prior to moving a position. OPM will not make revisions based on this comment. Collective bargaining obligations can arise with any new policies which impact bargaining unit employees. This includes implementation of policies found in any new or revised government-wide regulation, such as the final rule, so no new consultation process is required. The proposed rule did not purport to address new labor relations provisions and such matters \nare already subject to requirements in the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute of 1978. \nAnother commenter, an individual, \nsuggested that these regulatory amendments should be broadened to require that agencies disclose the underlying reasons for the movement. Comment 407. Comment 3894, an oversight nonprofit organization, also suggested that section 302.602(b)(6), regarding OPM publishing any such authorizations to move positions in the Federal Register, should be revised to require a solicitation for public comment. As stated above, OPM believes these amendments already strike the appropriate balance between being protective of rights and merit system principles and allowing for the efficiency and flexibility of normal government operations, so OPM does not believe that further process is necessary. Regarding Comment 407, there may be many underlying reasons for a move and a precise underlying reason, while potentially probative, does not get to the central inquiry for the retention of rights and status, which is whether the move was voluntary or involuntary. Still, those general reasons are implicit in 5 CFR 302.602(b)(2), which requires that an agency \u2018\u2018[d]ocument the basis for its determination that movement of the positions is consistent with the standards set forth by the President, Congress, OPM, or their designees as applicable.\u2019\u2019 OPM does not believe that further requirements on this point are necessary. Regarding Comment 3894, the purpose of publishing this information in the Federal Register is to increase transparency. OPM believes that publishing this information is \nsufficient and that public comment would add little further value. It would also risk the process becoming unduly burdensome. For these reasons, OPM will not adopt these suggestions. \nFinally, Comment 2816, by a former \nfederal official, again suggests that OPM clarify that the changes proposed within 5 CFR 302.602 include SES Positions. OPM will not adopt this suggestion for the same reasons it did not adopt a similar suggestion regarding section 302.601. The SES is not in the excepted service and is governed by a separate statutory structure that protects the career SES in different ways from the framework governing the competitive and excepted services. \n2. Notice Rights for Encumbered \nPositions \nOPM is promulgating additional \nrequirements, under 5 CFR 302.602(c), \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00052 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25033 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n384OPM is omitting Schedules D and E from this \nregulatory change because these schedules, for the \nPathways programs participants and Administrative Law Judges (ALJs), see 5 CFR 6.2, respectively, have \nspecific and unique requirements regarding eligibility and entrance into these positions. In particular, the Pathways programs, which were created by the President, not OPM, already have highly reticulated schemes for conversion of the appointee from the excepted service to the competitive service following the successful conclusion of the initial excepted service appointment. It is unlikely that the initial time- limited appointments to the excepted service would be appropriate vehicles for conversion to a different excepted service position, and, in any event, the incumbent would likely not yet have accrued adverse action rights in the excepted service positions they encumbered. Even if such rights had accrued, these appointees would enjoy such rights only for the balance of the original time-limited appointment. ALJ appointments were changed in light of ALJs\u2019 significant responsibilities in \u2018\u2018taking testimony,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018conducting trials,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018enforcing compliance with their orders,\u2019\u2019 and in some cases issuing \u2018\u2018the final word [for] the agencies they serve.\u2019\u2019 See E.O. 13843. Those specific duties, \ncarried out with \u2018\u2018significant discretion,\u2019\u2019 combined with a desire to eliminate any constitutional concerns regarding the method of ALJ appointments, were the reasons that ALJs were placed in the excepted service by the President as a matter of \u2018\u2018sound policy,\u2019\u2019 which allowed agencies to \u2018\u2018assess critical qualities in ALJs candidates\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018meet the particular needs of the agency,\u2019\u2019 such as \nsubject matter expertise relevant to the agency\u2019s work. Id. In addition, special chapter 75 procedures \napply to incumbent ALJs, and they can be removed from ALJ positions only by the employing agency at the conclusion of a specified proceeding at the MSPB. \n385Under 5 CFR 302.102(b), when an employee \nserving under a temporary appointment in the \ncompetitive service is selected for an excepted appointment, the agency must: \n1. Inform the employee that, because the position \nis in the excepted service, it may not be filled by \na competitive appointment, and that acceptance of the proposed appointment will take him/her out of the competitive service while he/she occupies the position; and \n2. Obtain from the employee a written statement \nthat he/she understands he/she is leaving the competitive service voluntarily to accept an appointment in the excepted service. \n38688 FR 63862, 63876\u201377 (citing to 5 CFR part \n731, subpart E and identifying twelve instances in which OPM has provided in regulation a basis for \nan appeal to the MSPB). \n387See Roberto v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, 440 F.3d \n1341, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Folio v. Dep\u2019t of \nHomeland Sec., 402 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Dowd v. United States, 713 F.2d 720, 722\u2013 \n23 (Fed.

It describes the information an agency must provide an employee whose position is being moved from the competitive service and placed in the excepted service, other than in Schedules D or E, or with an excepted service employee whose position is moved to another excepted service schedule, other than Schedules D or E.\n384In that case, under section \n302.602(c)(1)(i), no less than 30 days prior to moving the position, the agency must provide written notification to the employee of the intent to move the position. Under section 302.602(c)(1)(ii), if the move is involuntary, the notice must inform the employee that the employee maintains their civil service status and protections, if any, notwithstanding the movement of the position. \nEmployees who are in the competitive \nservice\u2014and who the agency is not planning to move\u2014may wish to apply for a new position in the excepted service and potentially relinquish accrued rights (such as a voluntary move from a competitive service position to a position as a Schedule C political appointee). In that situation, agencies must continue to comply with longstanding rules\u2014codified at 5 CFR 302.102(b)\u2014providing that employees be given notice that they are leaving the competitive service and requiring that employees acknowledge they understand that they are voluntarily leaving the competitive service to accept an appointment in the excepted service.\n385 \nOPM did not receive comments \nspecifically relating to 5 CFR 302.602(c). In this final rule, though, OPM is clarifying that a notice under section 302.602(c)(1)(ii), informing the employee that the employee maintains their civil service status and protections notwithstanding the movement of the position, applies where the move is involuntary. \n3. Appeal Rights for Encumbered \nPositions \nOPM further amends 5 CFR part 302 \nto establish that a competitive service employee whose position is moved involuntarily into the excepted service, or an excepted service employee whose position is moved involuntarily into a different schedule of the excepted service, may directly appeal to the MSPB if, contrary to these regulations, the entity perpetuating the move asserts that the move will strip the individual of any status and civil service protections they had already accrued. This rulemaking would not apply to situations where the employee applies for, is selected for, and accepts a new position with fewer or different civil service protections, since acceptance of that new position voluntarily relinquishes the protections the employee had already accrued. \nAs explained previously in Section \nIII(F), under 5 U.S.C. 1103(a)(5), a variety of other provisions governing specific topics under title 5, and delegations from the President, OPM has broad authority to execute, administer, and enforce civil service rules and regulations. Exercising these authorities, OPM has previously conferred rights of appeal to the MSPB with respect to a variety of personnel determinations, including, for example, final suitability determinations.\n386The Federal Circuit has repeatedly sustained \nthis practice and ruled that where an appeal is solely by regulation, the regulation circumscribes the scope of the appeal.\n387Title 5 explicitly provides \nthat an employee may appeal a personnel action made appealable by regulation.\n388The MSPB, in turn, has \nthe responsibility to \u2018\u2018hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Board under . . . law, rule or regulation.\n389 \nSection 302.603 \u2018\u2018Appeals\u2019\u2019 \nIn these final regulations, OPM is \nprescribing an MSPB appeal right for an employee whose position in the competitive service is moved to the excepted service involuntarily, or whose position in the excepted service is moved into a different schedule of the excepted service involuntarily, and when an entity effectuating such a move, contrary to these regulations, asserts that the individual loses any status and civil service protections they had already accrued. This provision would not apply when the employee voluntarily relinquishes such rights by applying for and accepting a new position with different rights. Such an appeal right would, however, cover an employee\u2019s allegation that an agency \ncoerced the employee to \u2018\u2018voluntarily\u2019\u2019 move to a new position that would require the employee to relinquish their competitive status or any civil service protections. OPM notes that an individual may choose to assert in any appeal to the MSPB that the agency committed procedural error, if applicable, by failing to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of section 302.602 while effecting any placement from the competitive service into the excepted service or from the excepted service to a different schedule of the excepted service. In cases where an individual asserts procedural error by the agency, OPM expects the MSPB would typically determine whether the procedural error was harmful as a pre-requisite for any reversal of the agency\u2019s action. The MSPB will find that an agency error is harmful only when the record shows that it was likely to have caused the \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25034 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n390See 5 CFR 1201.3 (Appellate Jurisdiction); \n1201.4(r) (Definitions, MSPB Practices and \nProcedures), 1205 (Powers and functions of the \nMerit Systems Protection Board); Ramey v.

Commenter also noted this regulatory language does not specify a time in which an aggrieved employee must file an appeal and expressed concern that this \u2018\u2018might not fully achieve OPM\u2019s aims.\u2019\u2019 Commenter expressed that, as proposed, the language could suggest that an agency could strip an employee of civil service status and protections in a manner contrary to this final rule and put the onus on the employee to rectify such an action before the MSPB. Or an agency might use silence or take a chance that an employee will not timely appeal, but that outcome would be unjust. Commenter therefore proposed a 180- day period for the employee to appeal, which commenter offered would allow sufficient time for the employee to gather information necessary for that appeal. OPM does not believe the final rule should specify a time period; the timing procedures should instead follow the normal processes associated with appeals to the MSPB. But OPM agrees that it should add a clause to this section specifying that the appeal rights conferred in part 302 are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any right the \nemployee would otherwise have to appeal a subsequent personnel action undertaken without following appropriate chapter 75 or chapter 43 procedures. The appeal right created by this rule merely provides an additional avenue for immediate correction if the agency asserts that accrued status or rights will no longer apply or fails to provide notice of the impact on accrued status or rights. To better capture OPM\u2019s intent, OPM will revise 5 CFR 302.603(a) to read: (a) A competitive service employee whose position is placed into the excepted service or who is otherwise moved involuntarily to the excepted service, or an excepted service employee whose position is placed into a different schedule of the excepted service or who is otherwise involuntarily moved to a position in a different schedule of the excepted service, may directly appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The appeal rights conferred in this section are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any right the individual would otherwise have to appeal a subsequent personnel action undertaken without following appropriate procedures under chapter 75, subchapter II, or section 4303 of title 5, United States Code. \nCommenter also suggested that the \nright in section 302.603(b) to appeal moves which \u2018\u2018purportedly\u2019\u2019 strip protections is too narrow. Commenter contended that it is possible that agencies will remain silent on an employee\u2019s civil service status and protections, and thereby could avoid an appeal because the agency has not \u2018\u2018purported\u2019\u2019 to have any effect on employee status and protections. Commenter also contended that subsection (b) addresses only the movement of a position. In contrast, subsections (a) and (c) of section 302.603 also cover the movement of an employee to a new position. OPM will revise this language to clarify that agencies cannot circumvent this final rule by moving an individual instead of a position. To better capture OPM\u2019s intent in this final rule, OPM will revise 5 CFR 302.602(b) to read: (b) Where the agency, notwithstanding the requirements of section 302.602 of this part, asserts that the move of the original position or any subsequent position to which the individual is involuntarily moved thereafter, will eliminate competitive status or any procedural and appeal rights that had previously accrued, the affected individual may appeal from that determination and request an order \ndirecting the agency (A) to correct the notice to provide that any previously accrued status or procedural and appeal rights under those provisions continue to apply, and (B) to comply with the requirements of either chapter 75, subchapter II or section 4303 of title 5, United States Code, in pursuing any action available under those provisions, except to the extent that any such order would be inconsistent with an applicable statute. \nTo address the concern that an agency \ncould remain silent regarding an employee\u2019s status and rights upon a move, OPM will modify section 302.603(c) to read that: Where the agency fails to comply with \u00a7 302.602(c)(1) of this part, and fails to provide an individual with the requisite notice, the affected individual may appeal and request an order directing the agency to comply with that provision. \nFinally, this commenter suggested \nthat OPM modify section 302.603 to also allow for appeals based on involuntary though not necessarily coercive movements. OPM will adopt this suggestion. Employees retain their civil service status and protections during involuntary movement into or within the excepted service, regardless of whether the movement was coerced or performed by other involuntary means. OPM will add a 5 CFR 302.603(d) to read: (d) An individual may appeal under this part on the basis that (A) a facially voluntary move was coerced or otherwise involuntary for purposes of this section or (B) a facially voluntary move to a new position would require the individual to relinquish their competitive status or any civil service protections and was coerced or was otherwise involuntary. \nAnother comment from an \nemployment lawyers association supportive of the rule suggested that OPM revise the rule to bring section 302.603 appeals under 5 U.S.C. 7701, so \nthat successful appellants are not burdened with attorney\u2019s fees or the costs of litigation. Comment 40. OPM appreciates this suggestion but will not add regulatory language to this effect as it goes beyond the scope contemplated in the proposed rule. If experience with such appeals indicates further changes might be warranted, OPM can pursue regulatory options then. \nComment 920, an individual, was \nsupportive of the rule but expressed concern that it would not be sufficiently protective in cases of \u2018\u2018wholesale reclassification.\u2019\u2019 The comment questioned whether individual appeals would be effective if an agency \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00054 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25035 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n391For example, in Blalock v.

It found that this RIF was improper, there was no reclassification warranting a RIF, and the redesignation was not a \u2018\u2018reorganization.\u2019\u2019 Therefore, the agency could not have conducted a RIF and the agency\u2019s abolishment of their Schedule A positions constituted individual adverse actions against the incumbents.

The President and OPM have the authority to reschedule positions but, as explained in this rule, there are ways to do so without infringing on this authority that are protective of the civil service and merit system principles as envisioned by Congress. Further, to the extent \u2018\u2018wholesale reclassification\u2019\u2019 is unlawful, there exist other avenues to challenge such a move besides the processes in this final rule.\n391 \nA few commenters supportive of the \nrule queried what happens when, by deliberative or inadvertent act, the MSPB is without a quorum. See Comments 44, 2442, 3687. As explained above, the appeals described in 5 CFR 302.603 should be treated like all other appeals to the MSPB. Therefore, OPM does not believe that it should revise this final rule to account for the possibility of a lack of a MSPB quorum. Even without a quorum, OPM notes, administrative judges (AJs) can issue initial decisions. If neither party to a case files a petition for review, the AJ\u2019s initial decision becomes the final decision of the Board. Appellants could then choose to exercise their judicial review rights.\n392If either party files a \npetition for review to the MSPB, a Board decision could not be issued until a quorum of at least two Board members is restored but the Clerk of the Board can still exercise delegated authority to \u2018\u2018grant a withdrawal of a petition for review when requested by a petitioner.\u2019\u2019\n393 \nFinally, Comment 2816, from a former \nfederal official, again suggests that OPM clarify that the changes proposed within 5 CFR 302.603 include SES Positions. OPM will not adopt it for the same reasons it did not adopt a similar suggestion regarding sections 302.601 and 302.602. \nV. Regulatory Analysis and Related\nComments\nA. Statement of Need\nOn December 12, 2022, OPM received\na petition from the National Treasury \nEmployees Union (NTEU), which represents Federal workers in 34 agencies and departments,\n394to amend \nOPM regulations in a manner that would ensure compliance with civil service protections and merit system principles for competitive service positions moved to the excepted service.\n395NTEU contends in its \npetition that Congress has established protections for \u2018\u2018employees\u2019\u2019 under chapter 75 in the competitive service and these protections create a constitutionally protected property interest in continued Federal employment. NTEU argued that no President can take away these rights, once accrued, without due process. \nOn May 23, 2023, the Federal Workers \nAlliance, a coalition of 13 labor unions representing over 550,000 Federal and postal workers, wrote OPM in support of the rulemaking changes proposed by NTEU. On May 26, 2023, the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL\u2013CIO, the largest union of Federal employees representing more than 750,000 Federal and District of Columbia workers, did the same. For the reasons described in the proposed rule and this final rule, OPM determined it was prudent to consider the points raised. \nBy operation of law, certain Federal \nemployees accrue a property interest in their continued employment and are entitled to adverse action rights under chapter 75 before they may be removed from career positions. Agencies are statutorily obligated to extend the specific protections codified at chapter 75 to eligible employees as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7511. OPM notes that this section precludes noncareer political appointees and other statutorily specified categories of employees from accruing these procedural rights, but OPM does not interpret chapter 75 as allowing the President, OPM, or an agency to waive the statutory rights that covered employees have accrued. These final rules are to clarify and reinforce \nthat point. \nThe now-revoked Executive Order \n13957 introduced a new conception of \nthe phrase \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making or policy- advocating character,\u2019\u2019 as used in the adverse action exception in 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(2), and sought to employ that conception to expand the category of employees excluded from adverse action procedural rights.\n396This phrase \nis a term of art with a long history. It has been broadly understood, based upon context, history, and practice, to mean political appointees. Using that language as the former President used it in Executive Order 13957\u2014to remove rights from career civil servants\u2014 departed from this established understanding. OPM has determined that a regulation interpreting and clarifying this provision, pursuant to OPM\u2019s statutory authority to prescribe regulations to carry out the purpose of subchapter II of chapter 75, is warranted.\n397 \nThe CSRA and merit system \nprinciples have informed OPM\u2019s regulations regarding the competitive and excepted services, and employee movement between them. One of those principles is that the creation of new positions in\u2014and movement of existing positions into\u2014the excepted service is meant to be an exception to the normal procedure for filling competitive service positions and maintaining the positions in that service thereafter. Accordingly, OPM has maintained for decades several safeguards and transparency measures associated with any such movements. These safeguards and measures may include agency reporting to OPM,\n398 \nsuch as where positions are placed temporarily in the excepted service for the purpose of a trial period leading to a permanent appointment in the \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25036 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n399See, e.g., 5 CFR part 362. \n4005 CFR 6.1. \n401Id. \n4025 CFR 302.102(b). 403Citing Feds for Med.

We seek to confirm these principles through this final rule. \nOPM received numerous comments \nrelating to the need for this rule. Most \nof the comments were supportive. \nComments Regarding the Need for This \nFinal Rule \nSeveral comments agreed with OPM \nthat this rule would protect the nonpartisan career civil service and merit system principles. Comment 684, an individual, contended that \u2018\u2018[t]he rule will help preserve the autonomy of the civil service, allowing its professionals to complete their work without arbitrary fear or favor of current elected office holders and making it possible for the government of the United States to serve its people consistently and evenhandedly across administrations.\u2019\u2019 See also Comments 9 \n(arguing that the government \u2018\u2018cannot properly function if civil servants are forced to curry political favor rather than carry out the work laid out for them by law,\u2019\u2019), 1310 (explaining that the rule will help preserve the many benefits of the civil service), 3687 (same). Comment 1691, an individual, contended that \u2018\u2018[b]y ensuring that federal employees retain their civil service protections and status during transitions between the competitive and excepted services, the rule enhances job security and employee rights.\u2019\u2019 Also, the rule \u2018\u2018clarifies the definitions of roles exempt from these protections, bringing greater transparency and adherence to legislative intent. Importantly, the introduction of procedural safeguards and the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board empowers employees, fostering a fairer and more accountable federal workforce.\u2019\u2019 Commenter concluded that \u2018\u2018[t]his rule change is not just a regulatory update; it\u2019s a reaffirmation of our commitment to a merit-based, transparent, and \nequitable civil service.\u2019\u2019 See also Comment 949 (an individual, expressing concern that ambiguities in the civil service statutes, addressed by this rule, could allow for mass firings based on political favor). \nRegarding the rule\u2019s protection of \nmerit system principles, an individual wrote, \u2018\u2018[i]n a time when preserving the merit-based and non-partisan principles of the federal workforce is of paramount importance, this proposed rule stands as a beacon of clarity and fairness.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3800. It is \u2018\u2018essential to safeguard the rights and protections of federal employees while also maintaining flexibility for necessary personnel movements. It is my firm belief that implementing this rule will promote good administration, uphold merit system principles, and provide federal employees with the confidence that their careers and rights are protected.\u2019\u2019 Id. Commenter concluded \nthat the rule \u2018\u2018ensures that decisions related to the movement of positions are made judiciously, with adherence to the rule of law and congressional intent.\u2019\u2019 \nSome commenters opposed to this \nrule argued that civil service procedures cause hiring, performance management, and misconduct challenges and this rule would only exacerbate those challenges \nand hurt accountability. Comment 4097 stated, \u2018\u2018Chapters 43 and 75 have proven to be longstanding and entrenched barriers to effectively addressing performance and conduct issues. . . . The reality is that they give federal employees \u2018a de facto form of life tenure, akin to that of Article III judges . . . What\u2019s more, federal employees know it\u2014and they take full-throated advantage of it.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n403 \nAs noted in prior sections, OPM does \nnot agree with commenter\u2019s characterizations of the futility of chapters 43 and 75 or that career civil servants are broadly \u2018\u2018taking advantage\u2019\u2019 of those protections to some inappropriate end. Under commenter\u2019s theory, Federal employment should be at-will. As discussed above and in the following Section V.(B), the civil service has sufficient and longstanding tools to deal with actual misconduct or unacceptable performance. If a Federal employee refuses to implement lawful direction from leadership, there are appropriate vehicles for agencies to respond through discipline and, ultimately, removal under chapter 75 or, alternatively, if performance related, chapter 43 and other authorities. More importantly, if commenter believes that the current performance management \nsystem, as reflected in chapters 43 and 75, is inadequate, then the appropriate solution is to try to convince Congress of that proposition and suggest corresponding changes to the statutory scheme. In contrast, distorting existing provisions to have a meaning untethered to long-settled understandings and removing adverse action rights from thousands of employees whom Congress intended to protect is not an appropriate means of addressing the putative problem with the statutory scheme. \nCommenter 4097 also argued that this \nrule, and its removal restrictions, are unnecessary to protect merit. Commenter wrote \u2018\u2018the merit system operated for eight decades with federal employees generally unable to appeal dismissals; the Lloyd-La Follette Act expressly provided that no trial or hearing would be required to effectuate removals. Many state governments currently operate at will. Nonpartisan, merit-based civil services can, do, and did operate effectively at will. Schedule F\u2019s elimination of those restrictions is fully consistent with an effective merit service.\u2019\u2019 Commenter then added \u2018\u2018[n]onetheless, OPM\u2019s confusion on these points is understandable\u2019\u2019 because \u2018\u2018federal unions prompted this rulemaking\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018have long used the specter of the spoils system to oppose civil service reforms.\u2019\u2019 \nWhile a labor union petitioned OPM \nto promulgate regulations regarding civil service protections, OPM is fully capable of analyzing these issues on its own, and is promulgating measured amendments, using its own expertise, and based squarely within statutory and regulatory authority, legal precedent, and history, to reinforce and clarify these longstanding civil service protections and merit system principles. \nAlso, as noted above, other \ncommenters (see Comment 2822) take \nissue with Comment 4097\u2019s interpretation of history and law in support of Schedule F. Since the Pendleton Act, Congress has barred terminations based on political grounds to preserve merit-system principles. A few years later President McKinley required just cause and written charges prior to removal\u2014requirements which were codified in the Lloyd La Follette \nAct to establish that covered Federal employees were to be both hired and removed based on merit. Comment 2816, a former federal official, cited studies showing the negative impacts of at-will employment on states and several other state employees commented how these reforms have been harmful. OPM therefore does not \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00056 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25037 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \nagree that the elimination of civil \nservice protections is \u2018\u2018fully consistent with an effective merit service.\u2019\u2019 \nSeveral individuals supportive of the \nrule argued that it would effectively protect civil servants from politicization. Comment 11 wrote that the \u2018\u2018proposed rule is a necessary and timely response\u2019\u2019 to efforts that could \u2018\u2018undermine the civil service system and politicize it for partisan purposes.\u2019\u2019 Comment 371 stated that the rulemaking would protect the civil service from \u2018\u2018employment decisions based on anything but job performance and qualifications.\u2019\u2019 See also Comments 704 \n(arguing that the rule \u2018\u2018acts as a necessary buffer against the potential upheaval and erosion of our institutions, and would help to ensure stability of essential government agencies.\u2019\u2019), 711, 3751. A professor contended the rule \u2018\u2018provides appropriate protection against these negative effects\u2019\u2019 of politicization. Comment 1971. \nA coalition of national and local \nunions, including the union that submitted the petition for rulemaking referenced above, expressed their support for this rule. They stated, \u2018\u2018OPM would make important clarifications regarding the rights of federal employees whose positions might be shifted from the competitive service to the excepted service or from one excepted service schedule to another. We urge OPM to finalize the rule promptly.\u2019\u2019 Comment 41. \nCommenters opposed to this rule \nargued that the civil service needs performance management, and this rule will have a negative effect on the stated intent, resulting in government inefficiency and waste. Comment 2866, a legal organization, argued that \u2018\u2018American taxpayers should not be forced to fund lazy, incompetent, or insubordinate federal employees who fail to complete their work, seek to undermine the democratic process by failing to carry out the President\u2019s \nagenda, or both.\u2019\u2019 Comment 4097 argued \u2018\u2018OPM\u2019s proposed rule would instead make dismissing employees in senior policy-influencing positions for poor performance or intransigence considerably more difficult. This would \u2018seal up\u2019 poor performers in the bureaucracy....  [C]hapter 43 and 75 \nprocedures are insufficient to combat these \u2018levers of resistance.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 \nFor the reasons stated above, OPM \ndisagrees with commenters\u2019 views as to the sufficiency of performance management tools. These tools are also addressed further in Section V.(B). Moreover, this rule tracks the status quo, so it would not make performance management more difficult. The amendments to parts 210, 212, 432, and 752 clarify longstanding civil service law and agency procedures. Nor do commenters explain how the changes to part 302 and resulting procedures would impact performance management. They are instead directed at potential movements of positions or employees from the competitive to the excepted service or between schedules in the excepted service, and added for the purposes of good administration, to enhance transparency, and to provide employees with a right of appeal to the MSPB to protect against potential abuses. In essence, they provide an avenue of relief to an employee in the event the employing agency fails to inform the employee of the impact of the move on the employee\u2019s rights or the employee is concerned that the move is an attempt to strip the employee of civil service status and protections. \nFurther, actual resistance to \nsupervisory direction would generally be expected to produce unacceptable performance that could be demonstrated on the record under either chapters 43 or 75. \nComment 4097, from an advocacy \nnonprofit organization, also argued that this rule would increase politicization. See also Comment 3156 (the same commenter, arguing that \u2018\u2018political appointees rationally respond to intransigent career staff by cutting them out of the policy process.\u2019\u2019). Comment 4097 argued that this rule would \u2018\u2018discourage vetting prospective policies with career staff\u2019\u2019 because \u2018\u2018the practical consequence of insulating career staff from accountability is political appointees cut them out of the loop to avoid leaks.\u2019\u2019 Commenter added \u2018\u2018[i]f career officials feared leaking draft policies could end their careers, political appointees would have more freedom to seek their input.\u2019\u2019 As an example, commenter states, \u2018\u2018OPM career staff were entirely cut out of the development of Schedule F. The White House realized sharing policy proposals with OPM career staff was tantamount to sending them to federal unions and other reform opponents.\u2019\u2019 \nGenerations of civil servants have \nworked with administrations and political appointees of both parties to advance their policies. For instance, as explained above, Comments 2822, a legal nonprofit organization, and 3038, a former civil servant, observe that the Reagan, Bush, and Trump Administrations succeeded in advancing many of their policy efforts even if, as Commenter 4097 contends, federal employees lean liberal. Commenter adds \u2018\u2018[i]f there were no \nrestrictions on removing policy- \ninfluencing career staff political appointees could simply dismiss employees they knew or strongly suspected leaked deliberative policy \ndocuments.\u2019\u2019 (emphasis added). This comment suggests that, under its preferred scheme, suspicion of leaking, without proof, would be a basis for removal. OPM believes such an environment would chill employees broadly and interfere with their willingness to present objective analyses and frank views in carrying out their duties, thus diminishing the reasoned consideration of policy options. Moreover, by instilling fear of reprisal and loss of employment, it would damage retention and recruitment efforts, as explored in the following section, thus further fracturing the successful functioning of government and our democracy. \nIndividuals opposed to this rule also \nadded that it is a means for the \u2018\u2018bureaucracy\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018protect itself from any disruption or risk to its continued employment.\u2019\u2019 Comment 20, see also Comment 3130. Comment 45, a former political appointee, stated this rule \u2018\u2018is a truly clear demonstration of bureaucrats in full self-protection mode, operating as an independent, unaccountable, deep state fourth branch of government, outside the United States Constitution\u2019\u2019 and its \u2018\u2018goal is simply to expand more protections to as many of the current administrative state\u2019s lackeys as possible.\u2019\u2019 Comment 31 adds \u2018\u2018[t]here is probably no private business that allows its \u2018employees\u2019 to first make up & approve their own policy, salary, benefits, performance etc. and then to \u2018manage\u2019 and \u2018interpret\u2019 their duties to the general public.\u2019\u2019 \nOPM is headed by a presidentially \nappointed and Senate-confirmed Director, who is accountable to the current President. It has both career staff and political appointees. Accordingly, this rule is not the work product of unaccountable bureaucrats. OPM also does not, through this rule or any rule, \u2018\u2018make up\u2019\u2019 the \u2018\u2018bureaucracy\u2019s\u2019\u2019 adverse action rights\u2014those rights have been granted to incumbents of various positions in the civil service by Congress after vigorous and careful debate. In that way, and many other ways, the civil service is also unlike employees in private businesses in the same way that government agencies, though mindful of sound business practices where they appropriately apply, are not and cannot be identical to a business. Congress decided, long \nago, to create a civil service based upon merit system principles (and has added, \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25038 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n404See 5 U.S.C. 1103(a)(5)(A). \n405E.O 14003, sec. 2. \n406Id. 407U.S. Off. of Pers.

OPM is tasked by statute with the authority to execute, administer, and enforce all civil service rules and regulations as well as the laws governing the civil service.\n404All of its \nrules give effect to Congress\u2019 intentions under title 5, including civil service protections and merit system principles. This rule is a standard exercise of the delegated authority Congress provided to OPM. \nSeveral commenters expressed \nsupport for the rule, in part, because it is being promulgated through notice and comment in accordance with the APA. This is contrasted with Executive Order 13957 establishing Schedule F, which a professor argued \u2018\u2018was developed in secret, with no consultation of public management researchers or experts who could provide evidence to inform its adoption.\u2019\u2019 Comment 50. It \u2018\u2018sought no consultation of researchers or experts in public management, so the Executive Order is free of any peer-reviewed evidence to support its adoption.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2594 (an individual), see also Comment 3213 (an individual). The rule, commenters argued, \u2018\u2018is thoroughly researched, and invites public comment,\u2019\u2019 demonstrating a high degree of public engagement. Comments 50, see also Comments 1677 (an individual), \n1780 (same). OPM takes no position as \nto the executive processes leading to Executive Order 13957 but does acknowledge this rulemaking process resulted from OPM\u2019s own research, informed by 60 days of public comment, and now reflects the review and consideration of the thousands of comments received. This final rule, moreover, furthers the objectives of Executive Order 14003. In the findings underpinning that Executive order, President Biden observed that the foundations of the civil service and its merit system principles were essential to the Pendleton Act\u2019s repudiation of the spoils system.\n405The President \nfurther noted that revoking Schedule F was necessary \u2018\u2018to enhance the efficiency of the civil service and to promote good administration and systematic application of merit system principles.\u2019\u2019\n406The amendments in this \nfinal rule support the civil service and merit system principles for career \nFederal employees. \nB. Regulatory Alternatives\nAn alternative to this rulemaking is to\nnot issue a regulation. OPM has \ndetermined this is not a viable option. The risks of not issuing this final rulemaking are many and include both fiscal as well as non-fiscal consequences. As noted in the preamble, this rulemaking is important for preserving the integrity of the Federal career workforce as an independent entity selected in a manner that is free of political influence, and free of personal loyalties to political leaders, consistent with merit system principles. Promulgating measures that help ensure that career employees maintain any status and procedural rights they have accrued under law is a means of preserving the integrity of the Federal career workforce. It preserves and promotes employee morale and settled expectations, minimizes workforce disruptions by preventing potential losses of seasoned or \nexperienced personnel, and contributes to a positive impact on agencies\u2019 ability to meet mission requirements. Finally, and importantly, these changes will promote compliance with statutory enactments. \nThe option of not regulating in this \narea carries with it fiscal costs as well. These costs include that of recruiting and replacing staff who separate before or after their positions are moved to the excepted service in a manner that purportedly strips them of their civil service protections, as well as the loss of or delay in services, benefits, and entitlements owed to many of our nation\u2019s citizens. Many of the citizens receiving these entitlements depend on them to meet their basic living expenses. \nMany commenters discussing \nregulatory alternatives focused on the potential impact of this final rule on performance management and the ability to recruit, hire, and retain talent. \nComments Regarding Performance \nManagement \nCommenters opposed to the rule \ncommented that career civil servants have too many poor performance issues and therefore fewer, not more, protections are needed to allow for their removal. See, e.g., Comment 1802 (an \nadvocacy organization). Comment 90, a form comment, points to a 2020 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) to say, generally, that \u2018\u2018the existing system . . . already faces challenges in addressing poor performance.\u2019\u2019 Comment 45, a former political appointee in favor in Schedule F, \nsimilarly cited the 2020 FEVS results\n407 \nshowing that 42% of employees agreed with the question: \u2018\u2018In my work unit, steps are taken to deal with a poor performer who cannot or will not improve.\u2019\u2019 Commenter then cited a different question in that FEVS which asked, \u2018\u2018In my organization, senior leaders generate high levels of \nmotivation and commitment in the \nworkforce.\u2019\u2019 (emphasis added). Commenter argued that \u2018\u2018[a]cross five years from 2016 to 2020, we see worryingly low rates of workers responding in the affirmative, with only 51% of workers doing so in 2020 and it being lower in all previous years surveyed.\u2019\u2019 Commenter concluded that this \u2018\u2018not only signals a demoralizing effect on those workers who do strive for efficiency and satisfactory performance but is also a cause of poor performance itself.\u2019\u2019 \nOPM disagrees with commenter\u2019s \nanalysis and conclusions. \u2018\u2018Senior leaders\u2019\u2019 in the FEVS are defined as the heads of departments/agencies and their immediate leadership team responsible for directing the policies and priorities of the department/agency.\n408These can \nbe career employees but are most often political appointees. It is unclear how the motivation and commitment question relating to senior leaders ties to performance management, as commenter concluded, especially since immediate supervisors\u2014the personnel most likely to handle performance management\u2014scored higher than senior leaders in relevant metrics in that same 2020 FEVS. For instance, 78% of respondents said their immediate supervisor was doing a \u2018\u2018good job\u2019\u2019 overall and 87% said their supervisor treated them with respect. Regarding their close colleagues, 82% of respondents said their work unit had the \u2018\u2018job-relevant knowledge and skills necessary to accomplish organizational goals\u2019\u2019 and 84% said the people they worked with \u2018\u2018cooperate to get the job done.\u2019\u2019 \nComment 4097 and others also argued \nthat FEVS data shows \u2018\u2018[a]gencies fail to address poor performers effectively,\u2019\u2019 \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00058 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25039 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n409Citing statistics on federal employees drawn \nfrom Office of Personnel Management FedScope \ndata on the federal workforce. citing 2021\u20132023 FEVS data and the \nsame question as above, this time showing approximately 40% of respondents agreeing that \u2018\u2018their agency had taken steps to deal with a poor performer who cannot or will not improve.\u2019\u2019 See also Comments 1811, \n3190, 3892. A few also argued (or cited surveys that they allege show) that public trust in government is low. See Comments 1811, 1958. Comment 4097 adds that \u2018\u2018[m]isconduct\u2014including policy resistance\u2014occurs at unacceptably high levels. The federal hiring process is also widely recognized as broken. The federal workforce needs reform.\u2019\u2019 \nAs explained above, under the law, a \nmere difference of opinion with leadership does not qualify as misconduct or unacceptable performance or otherwise implicate the efficiency of the service in a manner that would warrant an adverse action. The FEVS data that commenters argued shows there are too many poor performers in government does not, in fact, show a numerical prevalence of poor performers. There is an important difference between (a) data showing a belief by respondents that poor performers exist and the agency has not adequately addressed their performance and (b) the existence of too many poor performers. For example, if a work unit contains one employee with performance issues out of a 100, then 99 might have one example of a poor performer who has not yet been removed or demoted, but that does not necessarily mean the work unit has a prevalence of poor performers. Also, unless the respondents are in the supervisory chain of an employee with performance issues, they would have little way of knowing what \u2018\u2018steps are being taken to deal with a poor performer who cannot or will not improve,\u2019\u2019 which is the FEVS question repeatedly cited in these comments. For privacy reasons, supervisors would not normally share information about a particular employee\u2019s performance or behavior with other employees, nor would the supervisor be likely to disclose what actions had been taken in response. Commenters have not shown that there are significant numbers of poor performers in government. OPM notes that a 2016 GAO report showed \u2018\u201899 percent of all permanent, non-SES employees received a rating at or above \u2018fully successful\u2019 in calendar year 2013. Of these, approximately 61 percent were rated as either \u2018outstanding\u2019 or \u2018exceeds fully successful.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 In any event, even if it could be demonstrated that there was a high proportion of unacceptable performance or misconduct among employees, OPM is not free to remove adverse action rights from large swathes of career civil servants. That is an action that may be taken only by congressional enactment. \nA few individuals opposed to the rule \nargued that career civil servants are inefficient and/or provide poor service to the American public. See Comments \n18, 29. A nonprofit organization claimed the civil service was ineffective and blamed it on the lack of competition \u2018\u2018that makes the private sector efficient.\u2019\u2019 Comment 1811. Commenter argued that once an employee accrues worker protections, \u2018\u2018they have little incentive to improve their work.\u2019\u2019 And should an agency allege poor performance, \u2018\u2018the federal worker has ample time to improve their performance and challenge the claims of the agency.\u2019\u2019 Comment 4097 concurred with this notion, arguing that \u2018\u2018[i]n addition to sheltering poor performers, removal restrictions directly make federal employees less productive. Economists consistently find that giving employees removal protections reduces their productivity.\u2019\u2019 OPM notes that commenter cited Ichino and Riphahn (2005); Martins (2009); Riphahn (2004); Scoppa (2010); Scoppa and Vuri (2014) for this proposition. These studies all concern European workers with European-style labor protections. Four exclusively consider private industry and three are further restricted to the impact of a single statute on Italian labor markets. None are about the American civil service. Also, these papers do not purport to and could not show that removing American civil service protections would make career civil servants more efficient. A loss of protections, instead, would likely lead to a loss of motivation to invest in and hone their skills. \nWith respect to the claim that, should \nan agency allege poor performance, \u2018\u2018the federal worker has ample time to improve their performance and challenge the claims of the agency,\u2019\u2019 we note that many supervisors can and do use chapter 75, rather than chapter 43, to suspend, demote, or remove an employee with a history of unacceptable performance. Although it is true that the statutory scheme provides for a notice period and an opportunity to respond, in a chapter 75 adverse action proceeding, the supervisor need only disclose the grounds for proposing the action (which can be unacceptable performance), provide evidence to support the charge, and demonstrate that the action proposed will promote the efficiency of the service. There is no requirement to let the employee try to \nimprove their performance. \nOne form comment argued, without \nevidence, that career civil servants do not deserve protections because they are captured by industry. See Comment 14, \n26. The comment contended that, once a career federal employee has lost independence of decision making to \u2018\u2018the patronage of a corporation,\u2019\u2019 the employee is no longer applying their merit to their employment function, thus their \u2018\u2018merit score would be rendered \u2018zero.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 The comment argued the employee would then be subject to employment termination. Commenter provided no evidence for this assertion. Whether some civil servants are influenced improperly by outside corporations in the way they conduct their official duties is outside the scope \nof this rule. But OPM notes that such demonstrable influence, to the extent it exists, could be a violation of federal ethics laws and, in any event, could readily be addressed by existing performance management mechanisms. We reiterate, as well, that whether or not civil servants \u2018\u2018deserve\u2019\u2019 adverse action protections, Congress has provided for them by law, and OPM is not free to eliminate the protections merely because it would allow agencies to more easily remove employees. \nConversely, several commenters in \nsupport of the rule agreed with OPM and argued that the civil service already has sufficient tools to deal with performance issues. A public service nonprofit organization commented that \u2018\u2018[c]ritics often claim that it is impossible to fire poor performing federal employees, but data shows that over 10,000 federal employees are terminated or removed due to discipline or performance issues each year (a trend that goes back to at least 2005).\u2019\u2019\n409 \nComment 44. It continued, \u2018\u2018[d]espite many misconceptions about the prevalence of poor performers in government, there are reasonable approaches to ensuring managers are trained in using disciplinary and removal procedures and have the necessary tools to manage their workforce, including a streamlined adjudicatory and appeals process.\u2019\u2019 Comment 1228, an individual, argued that \u2018\u2018[t]hough some may argue that the current system is incapable of removing bad employees, a.) there is little evidence that such incapacity exists, it seems like there are not only good agencies doing good work but also the need to fully staff those same offices, \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00059 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25040 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n410See 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1). 411Citing David E. Lewis, \u2018\u2018Politicization and \nPerformance: The Larger Pattern, in The Politics of \nPresidential Appointments: Political Control and Bureaucratic Performance,\u2019\u2019 pp. 172, 191 (2008). and b.) the benefits of removing low \nperforming employees more easily is drastically outweighed by the risk of an administration creating massively unpredictable alterations to government functioning based on the whims of an incoming administration.\u2019\u2019 Comment 4016, an individual who worked for the Federal Government for 30 years, added that \u2018\u2018[p]oliticization only leads to incompetence in the federal workforce. It\u2019s not easy but a manager can remove poor performers. It can be done as I\u2019ve witnessed and have done many times.\u2019\u2019 OPM agrees that the civil service contains tools to address misconduct or performance issues. \nComments Regarding the Effect of the \nRule on the Recruitment, Hiring, and Retention of Talent \nIn addition to comments about \nperformance management, OPM received many comments about the rule\u2019s impact on recruitment, hiring, and retention efforts. This rulemaking is expected to create an incentive for such efforts. It will enhance agencies\u2019 ability to fulfill important merit system principles, that recruitment should be from qualified individuals in an endeavor to achieve a workforce from all segments of society, and that selection and advancement should be determined solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition which assures that all receive equal opportunity.\n410It also promotes \ncompliance with the congressional policy to confer a preference on eligible veterans or family members entitled to derived preference. In a more pragmatic sense, diminishing or eliminating civil service protections from entire categories of career employees would destabilize the civil service\u2014potentially repeatedly, each time there is a change in administration\u2014and eliminate a competitive advantage Federal agencies have long enjoyed when competing with \nother sectors for needed talent: stable, fair, merit-based employment. \nFailure to protect adverse action \nrights and other civil service protections risks a loss of experienced staff, leading to a disruption, if not interruption, of agency mission operations. This is an especially important consideration given the many challenges facing our nation that require a response by the Executive branch. These challenges include threats to our nation\u2019s economy writ large, as well as problems impacting small businesses and emerging markets and technologies. There are challenges associated with public health, climate (including impacts on both private property and businesses impacted by droughts, floods, wildfires, etc.), data security, and pressing international and geopolitical matters, among others. \nMany commenters were concerned \nthat not issuing this rule would allow politicization (or even the threat of politicization) to increase in the career civil service, which would hurt government recruitment, hiring, and retention efforts. \nOPM received several comments \nconcerning politicization that noted, as a baseline concept, that the civil service, unlike much employment in the private sector, is spurred by mission-driven work. Comment 3022 contended \u2018\u2018[o]pponents of the Civil Service often voice two objections: \u2018Government should be run like a business\u2019 and \u2018The boss has the right to hire and fire at will.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Commenter argued that government is not a business because the purpose of a business is to turn a profit whereas the purpose of government, as \u2018\u2018stated in the first paragraph of the Constitution\u2019\u2019 is to \u2018\u2018form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.\u2019\u2019 \nThis desire for mission-driven work \nhelps explain why politicization in the civil service impacts job satisfaction and morale, argued commenters. Comment 2660, a science advocacy nonprofit organization, cited evidence suggesting that when federal scientists perceive that their workplaces are free from political interference, there are positive knock-on effects, such as making that federal agency more attractive when recruiting other federal scientists and increasing retention. Comment 2816, a former federal official, showed that \u2018\u2018[e]mployees in highly politicized agencies evince \u2018less general satisfaction in the workplace and federal workers in more politicized agencies are less likely to believe their agency compares favorably with other organizations and to recommend their job as a good place to work.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n411 \nOther commenters in support of this \nrule argued that it would help recruitment. Comment 2059, an individual, expressed that \u2018\u2018[a]s someone considering joining the civil service, this is the type of clarification and improvement I would need to see before moving forward.\u2019\u2019 See also Comments 84 (an individual, commenting about the difficulty to recruit and retain competent and dedicated employees to the civil service if they knew that they might lose their jobs at any moment for political reasons), 3038 (a former civil servant arguing that increased politicization diminishes the attraction of government jobs \u2018\u2018to excellent workers with the temperament to be truly dedicated public officials\u2019\u2019). Comment 2193, a women\u2019s health nonprofit organization, argued that \u2018\u2018[m]erit system protections are important for attracting highly qualified individuals to fill open positions and retaining employees who have developed valuable expertise in their topic areas.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2004, an individual, added that \u2018\u2018[e]roding [civil service] protections would also damage the federal government\u2019s ability to attract good people, as job security and a sense of purpose are two attractive features of many federal jobs which attract talent that could easily make more money working somewhere else.\u2019\u2019 Commenter continues, \u2018\u2018[i]f these employees have to worry that every election could mean the end of their federal careers, we\u2019ll have a tough time attracting and retaining good people, meaning we\u2019ll have severely damaged the government\u2019s ability to effectively serve the country and implement the policies and programs of any President or Congress.\u2019\u2019 As examples of politicization\u2019s potential impact on government recruitment, Comment 1904, a national parks advocacy organization, pointed to the National Park Service, saying \u2018\u2018[t]he NPS is already struggling with recruiting and retaining employees and the risk of political retribution or misguided politically-driven decisions would only create further challenges.\u2019\u2019 Comment 857, an individual, gives, as an example, the Environmental Protection Agency, saying \u2018\u2018[t]he EPA and other agencies will not be able to attract and retain the best professional staff if they are subject to at will firing. U.S. citizens will not be as safe as a result.\u2019\u2019 \nComment 407, an individual, detailed \nhow this rule directly impacts OPM\u2019s recruitment and human capital management goals. The rule would \u2018\u2018help to maintain the progress of the past two decades on strategic human capital management.\u2019\u2019 Since 2001, commenter noted, GAO has placed strategic human capital on its biennial high-risk list.

Regarding these types of positions, Comments 3687, a science advocacy organization, and 3973, an anti-poverty nonprofit organization, added that \u2018\u2018[i]ncreased politicization of roles also makes public service less attractive and can result in higher turnover and fewer incentives to develop expertise. Managing federal science and technology programs requires a steady cadre of subject area experts, including working with program partners and grantees and balancing competing operational, legal, and political needs. Federal agencies already face challenges hiring and retaining employees in positions that require highly-specialized technical expertise, and failure to insulate the civil service from politicization introduces additional instability and exacerbates this issue.\u2019\u2019 Similarly, Comment 2660, another science advocacy organization, argued that \u2018\u2018[f]ailing to ensure that federal scientists\u2019 jobs are based on merit and other civil service protections is more likely to push federal scientists to consider leaving federal agencies for workplaces that better fit the demands and norms of their scientific profession.\u2019\u2019 Comment 3409, a former civil servant, contended that \u2018\u2018researchers and evaluators who wish to conduct unbiased analyses and present an honest representation of results may \navoid civil service positions under such conditions. The quality of the federal workforce would decline as a result.\u2019\u2019 Comment 2001 added \u2018\u2018[a]s a trained engineer with extensive software, data analysis, and data science experience, I have long considered working for the federal government a dream of mine that I would love to pursue should the opportunity arise. The reason for that is that the United States\u2019 strong tradition of an apolitical, well-protected civil service that is hired and rewarded based on merit, rather than political connections, makes it something that I couldn\u2019t help but aspire to. This tradition must be protected.\u2019\u2019 \nOne commenter opposed to the rule \nargued it will hurt the ability to hire, but that seems to be based largely on their concerns about the time and resources necessary to hire into the competitive service. Comment 4097 stated \u2018\u2018the competitive hiring process is broken. There is widespread consensus that the federal hiring process needs reform. It takes agencies an average of about 100 days\u2014more than three months\u2014to fill vacant positions in the competitive service.\u2019\u2019 Commenter argued that private employers do not have to use these procedures and can hire qualified applicants much more expeditiously. The Comment fails to acknowledge, however, that the rules governing the competitive hiring process were established, largely, by Congress. Congress\u2019 objective was to filter a merit system principle\u2014that selection and advancement of candidates be \ndetermined on the basis of relative levels of knowledge, skills, and abilities\u2014through rules enacted to confer a defined advantage, in the process of rating and selection, on individuals eligible for veterans\u2019 preference.\n412 \nComment 4097 concluded that OPM\u2019s \nrecruitment concerns regarding efforts to strip career employees of civil service protections are misplaced. Commenter argued that, \u2018\u2018[Executive Order 13957] prohibited patronage and stipulated that Schedule F positions would last beyond a presidential term....  Contrary to \nOPM\u2019s concerns, Schedule F employees would keep their jobs so long as they performed well and faithfully advanced the President\u2019s agenda.\u2019\u2019 As explained previously, however, if career civil servants become at-will employees, thereby subjecting them to removal without any cause, we do not understand the basis for commenter\u2019s view that such employees \u2018\u2018would keep their jobs.\u2019\u2019 They may keep their jobs\u2014 \nbut they also would be removable at \nwill for any number of reasons. \nComment 4097 stated that \u2018\u2018OPM\u2019s \nrecruitment concerns have not materialized in states with at-will workforces.\u2019\u2019 Commenter again cited snippets of a report concluding that at- will employment \u2018\u2018makes the HR function more efficient.\u2019\u2019 Whether states can more efficiently fill these positions proves nothing about the applicant pool or the quality of the candidates ultimately selected. See Comment 2816 \n(regarding the effect on state civil servants of at-will laws). At any rate, as Commenter 4097 concedes, these state systems operate under statutory provisions that differ meaningfully from those of title 5. \nComments Outside the Scope of This \nRulemaking and/or OPM\u2019s Regulatory Authority \nCommenters also suggested a variety \nof other changes. These included requests to curb burrowing in, limit large scale movements of employees (including capping the number of Schedule C appointments), scrutinize the appointments and functions of the SES, review hiring preferences and agencies\u2019 uses of preferences, add whistleblower protections, modify assignment rights applicable to RIF, clarify how agencies should better use probationary periods, reform chapters 43 and 75, streamline performance and accountability processes, and consider whether policies promoted by the rule could be included in collective bargaining agreements. See Comments \n6, 33, 38, 44, 2442, 2849, 3049, 3227, 3428, 3687, 3894. OPM appreciates these suggestions but found they were either outside the scope of this rulemaking, outside of OPM\u2019s regulatory authority, or both. \nAs described above, commenters \nproposed revisions to some of OPM\u2019s regulatory changes to 5 CFR parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, and 752. For the reasons described above and summarized below, they were adopted or rejected in whole or in part. \nRegarding 5 CFR part 752, OPM\u2019s \nchanges to the regulations for adverse actions are consistent with statute and cannot be further simplified.

However, as the MSPB observed in urging OPM to update 5 CFR 752.401: \nRetaining out-of-date information in a \nGovernment regulation can confuse agencies, managers, and employees and produce unintended outcomes. Human resources specialists or managers who are not experts in employee discipline may inadvertently rely on these particular regulations. Agencies may fail to use proper procedures and fail to notify employees of appeal rights. Terminations may be reversed.\n415 \nOPM agrees that current regulations \nneed updating and does so through this rulemaking. \nOPM is amending the coverage- \nrelated provisions in part 752 to close the gap between current regulations and relevant precedent interpreting the underlying statute, thus adding clarity. In addition, OPM provides guidance on implementing the statute. Having regulations that are congruent to the underlying statute, as interpreted in binding precedent, should mitigate potential errors in cases where an agency might mistakenly believe it is free to terminate employment without following adverse action procedures. Failure to align the regulations with applicable precedents could produce improper terminations. These terminations might then be overturned at the MSPB, resulting in wasted resources and frustration for agency supervisors. It could also mean the continued employment of a poorly performing employee, until a proceeding under chapter 75 or chapter 43 could be undertaken and sustained. Revising this regulation thus promotes efficiency in removing or disciplining employees and addresses complaints that the Federal removal process is too cumbersome. Through this rulemaking, OPM is conforming the regulation to essential statutory requirements that have not been previously reflected in OPM\u2019s regulations. OPM is issuing these regulations in \nthe least burdensome way possible. \nFundamentally, the amendments to part 752 do not impose new requirements on agencies that are not already in place through existing statutes, regulations, and case law. This includes the provisions that an employee retains accrued rights when the employee is moved involuntarily from the competitive service to the excepted service or placed in a new schedule within the excepted service. \nWith respect to 5 CFR part 210, OPM \nconsidered not defining \u2018\u2018confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018confidential or policy-determining\u2019\u2019 positions but, as stated in the proposed rule and here, doing so adds important clarity. This final rule more explicitly defines the employees and positions that are excluded from civil service protections to align with relevant statutory text, congressional intent, legislative history, legal precedent, and OPM\u2019s longstanding practice. Accordingly, OPM adds a definition for these terms of art to clarify that they mean a noncareer political appointment that is identified by its close working relationship with the President, head of an agency, or other key appointed officials who are directly responsible for furthering the goals and policies of the President and the administration, and that carries no expectation of continued employment beyond the presidential administration during which the appointment occurred. \nFinally, OPM\u2019s addition of 5 CFR \n302.602 establishes minimum requirements for moving employees and positions into and within the excepted service and creates new guardrails to protect existing rights and reinforce merit system principles. OPM also confers in 5 CFR 302.603 a narrow MSPB appeal right to an employee whose position is placed involuntarily into the excepted service, or an excepted service employee whose position is placed involuntarily into a different schedule of the excepted service, and when, in any such move, in violation of these regulations, an agency asserts that the employee loses status or any civil service protections they had already accrued. \nOPM weighed the alternative of not \nconferring a right of appeal to the \nMSPB. As stated in 5 CFR 1201.3, the MSPB\u2019s \u2018\u2018appellate jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation.\u2019\u2019 Currently, for personnel actions for which there is no MSPB appellate coverage, an aggrieved Federal employee may have multiple other options for contesting a personnel \ndecision, including filing an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) \ncomplaint, an OSC complaint, an administrative grievance, or if applicable, a grievance under a negotiated grievance procedure. However, with regard to an allegation that an agency has asserted that the employee loses status or any civil service protections the employee has already accrued, or that an agency coerced the employee to move in a manner that was facially voluntary to a new position that would require the employee to relinquish their status or any civil service protections, OPM concluded that the current scheme of avenues for redress is less complete than preferable to safeguard against actions brought against employees for reasons stated above. Such actions would have an adverse impact on employee morale across Federal agencies and a corrosive effect on the American public\u2019s confidence in equitable administrative processes of Federal civilian service. \nCurrently, if an employee alleges that \nan agency has committed a prohibited personnel practice, the employee can file a complaint with OSC, or if the employee is contesting an otherwise appealable action, the employee can file an MSPB appeal of the personnel action and claim as an affirmative defense that the agency committed a prohibited personnel practice. OPM\u2019s selected option\u2014the addition of 5 CFR 302.603\u2014provides an earlier recourse to employees, following an involuntary movement, or at a later point, if a personnel action is undertaken without following appropriate procedures, as detailed in section 302.603. This enables employees to protect their status and rights and reinforces that affected employees are deserving of fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of their employment as it relates to movement to and within the excepted service. \nC. Impact\nThese revisions clarify and reinforce\nexisting employee protections and add \nprocedures that agencies must follow to further advance merit system principles. Congress enacted procedural rules to provide an adequate opportunity to hear from the tenured employee and appropriately explore the underlying facts and law before adverse actions are taken and thus help ensure that such actions are taken for proper cause.\n416 \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00062 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25043 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \nWhat_ is_Due_ Process_ in_Federal_ Civil_ Service_\nEmployment_ 1166935.pdf. \n417Id., at cover letter. \n418See Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 541. \n419U.S. Merit Sys.

The procedural protections enacted by \nCongress are for all tenured employees, not only for the few employees who will inevitably present problems in a workforce of more than two million individuals. And procedural protections exist for \u2018\u2018the whistleblower, the employee who belongs to the \u2018wrong\u2019 political party, the reservist whose periods of military service are inconvenient to . . . [superiors], the scapegoat, and the person who has been misjudged based on faulty information.\u2019\u2019\n417 \nWhere Congress has created a \nproperty interest in a position for tenured employees, due process considerations protect employees from an unlawful deprivation of that interest.\n418Procedural protections are a \nsmall price to pay to deliver to the American people a merit-based civil service rather than a system based on political patronage.\n419 \nFor the reasons stated in the proposed \nrule and in Section IV(A\u2013C) of this final rule\u2014including OPM\u2019s responses to comments therein\u2014these rules will reinforce protections and procedural requirements that exist already for most Federal employees. OPM believes that those portions of the rules will not change any existing requirements for agencies covered by the rules and the impact on agencies is expected to be negligible. \nThe procedural requirements for \nmoving an employee from the competitive service to the excepted service or within the excepted service are no more rigorous than the many other regulations promulgated by OPM for the administration of the civil service, especially those reticulated regulations related to the excepted service under schedules D and E (as described above). The reporting requirements relating to excepted service positions align with those with which OPM already must comply. \nD. Costs\nThis final rule requires agencies to\nupdate internal policies and procedures \nto ensure compliance with the final regulations at 5 CFR 210.102(b), 212.401, 213.3301, 302.101, 302.602, 302.603, 451.302 and with the regulatory amendments to parts 432 and 752 as well as resolve any appeals that may arise from contested moves covered by part 302. Regarding the procedural requirements for moving positions, the rule will affect the operations of approximately 80 Federal agencies, ranging from cabinet-level departments to small independent agencies. OPM cannot estimate these costs with great specificity because they will vary depending on the specific number of positions an agency would seek to move. \nThe cost analysis to update policies \nand procedures and resolve appeals assumes an average salary rate of Federal employees performing this work at the 2024 rate for a GS\u201314, step 5, from the Washington, DC, locality pay table ($157,982 annual locality rate and $75.70 hourly locality rate). We assume the total dollar value of labor, which includes wages, benefits, and overhead, is equal to 200 percent of the wage rate, resulting in an assumed labor cost of $151.40 per hour. \nWe estimate that the cost to comply \nwith updating policies and procedures in the first year would require an average of 40 hours of work by employees with an average hourly cost of $151.40 per hour. Upon publication of the final rule, this would result in first-year estimated costs of about $6,056 per agency, and about $484,480 governmentwide. There are ongoing costs associated with routinely reviewing and updating internal policies and procedures, but not necessarily a measurable increase in costs for agencies. \nTo comply with the regulatory \nrequirements in this final rule, affected agencies would need to resolve any appeals that may arise pursuant to section 302.603. We estimate that, in the first year following publication of a final rule, this would require an average of 120 hours of work by employees with an average hourly cost of $151.40 per hour. This would result in estimated costs in \nthat first year of implementation of about $18,168 per agency, and about $1.45 million governmentwide. In subsequent years, we assume a decreased need for appeal resolution as agencies further refine their processes under section 302.603, resulting in less staff time. Accordingly, in subsequent years, we estimate an average of 80 hours of work by employees with an average hourly cost of $151.40 per hour. This would result in estimated costs of about $12,112 per agency annually, and about $968,960 governmentwide annually in the years after the first year of implementation. \nOPM did not receive comments \nrelated to the financial costs of this rulemaking, which were presented in the proposed rule.\n420OPM adheres to its view in the proposed rule and will adopt the estimates as set forth here. In sum, OPM estimates the first-year cost to be approximately $24,224 per agency, and about $1.94 million governmentwide. For subsequent years, we estimate annual costs to be $12,112 for agencies, and about $968,960 governmentwide. \nE. Benefits\nThese final regulations clarify the\nFederal civil service protections that are \ncritical to balancing an effective, experienced, and objective bureaucracy with Executive branch control. These regulations benefit the American people not only by shoring up longstanding civil service protections, but also by promoting good government. As stated in Executive Order 14003, it is this Administration\u2019s policy to \u2018\u2018protect, empower, and rebuild the career Federal workforce.\u2019\u2019 This rulemaking benefits the career Federal workforce by reinforcing that it is deserving of the trust and confidence of the American people. \nOPM stated in its Fiscal Year 2019 \nHuman Capital Review Summary Report that \u2018\u2018Agencies face different challenges depending on their mission and the current state of their organizations; but there is little debate that effectively managing human capital is at the forefront of leadership\u2019s greatest priorities.\u2019\u2019\n421Among the top trends \nthat surfaced during OPM\u2019s review were (1) identifying and closing skills gapsand (2) recruiting and retainingemployees. For example, agencies raisedconcerns around attrition rates forscientific and technical positions aswell as an inability to hire fast enoughto meet demands. The ongoingchallenge with recruitment andretention for IT and cyber positions isdue to the ever-changing landscape,competition with the private sector andother Federal agencies, and difficultyretaining talent.\nThis final rule has several important \nbenefits. It supports the retention of Federal career professionals who provide the continuity of institutional knowledge and subject-matter expertise necessary for the critical functioning of the Federal Government.\n422\u2018\u2018A vast \nbody of research\u2019\u2019 shows \u2018\u2018public service motivation as a central factor in public \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00063 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25044 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \n423Id. \n424Id. \n425Id. 426See id.; see also Donald P.

Nevertheless, the final rule will protect agencies\u2019 abilities to meet mission requirements by mitigating disruptions caused by upheavals within an agency\u2019s workforce, the result of which could have a negative impact on an agency\u2019s ability to meet mission requirements and use its resources (including taxpayer funds) in a timely and efficient manner. \nComments Regarding the Benefits of \nThis Final Rule \nThe benefits of civil service \nprotections, which this rule would uphold, have been widely recognized by Congress, civil servants, and the American public for 140 years. Comment 2816, a former federal official, argued that \u2018\u2018[t]he notion of a competitively selected civil service is far from a modern creation; the justification for competitive selection stretches more than a century and a half. Throughout that period, Congress has grappled with the same concerns\u2014 whether and how to insulate civil servants from political forces, how to ensure the civil service is staffed by experienced professionals, how to promote trust that the government acts in the public interest\u2014that are at stake in contemporary debates about civil service protections.\u2019\u2019 \nFor these reasons, OPM believes that \ncivil service protections and merit system principles provide significant benefits both to civil servants and the American people. This final rule will reduce the risks associated with misapplying the CSRA, depriving civil service protections to those who have rightfully earned them, and needlessly politicizing our nation\u2019s nonpartisan career civil service. \nAs several commenters noted, there is \nlittle evidence that supports the notion that a more politicized civil service would increase governmental performance.\n426A professor noted that \nopponents of this rule have cited a paper by Spenkuch, Teso and Xu, which argues that political misalignment between political appointees and career agency officials can lead to cost overruns and delays in procurement contracts.\n427Comment 50. The paper \nreaches this conclusion by looking at voter registration data for civil servants, but especially for procurement officers, and then examines the performance of contracts the procurement officers oversaw, including any cost overruns, ex post modifications, or delays. But Comment 50 argued that the paper actually shows the risks of politicization. The professor argued that, \u2018\u2018[w]hile there are certainly key decisions where political appointees should shape policy, specific procurement outcomes is not one. There is no Democratic or Republican ideological approach to procurement that should alter how existing legal processes are implemented.\u2019\u2019 Commenter continued that politicizing \nprocurement through political alignment would risk \u2018\u2018temporary partisan employees redirecting procurement processes to satisfy politically favored contractors\u2019\u2019 and that \u2018\u2018peer-reviewed research in the top- ranked American Journal of Political \nScience\u2019\u2019 demonstrates this point.\n428A \nreview of federal procurement processes between 2003\u20132015 shows that greater politicization is associated with more non-competitive contracts and greater cost overruns. The authors of the study that Comment 50 cites conclude that \u2018\u2018agency designs that limit appointee representation in procurement decisions reduce political favoritism.\u2019\u2019\n429Another \nprofessor argued that there is \u2018\u2018no equivalent body of peer reviewed evidence\u2019\u2019 supporting the idea that removing career civil servants from office improves government performance or responsiveness. Studies show that the opposite is true. Comment 1927. \nFinally, agency counsel and employee \nrelations practitioners will benefit from the clarifications in this final rule that address current inconsistencies between OPM regulations and statute. After the MSPB recommended that OPM update its regulations to reflect the Federal Circuit\u2019s decisions in Van Wersch and McCormick,\n430OPM revised 5 CFR part \n752, subpart D to conform to the court\u2019s interpretation of 5 U.S.C. 7511 as it pertains to appealable suspensions, removals, and furloughs. However, OPM elected at that time not to update subpart B of part 752 for suspensions of 14 days or less. In addition to closing regulatory gaps in part 752 by conforming the regulations to case law \nand statute, OPM clarifies that an employee moved to or within the excepted service retains accrued procedural and appeal rights. The cumulative effect of these changes will be a comprehensive and robust regulatory framework on which agency practitioners can rely for understanding and applying the protections available to Federal employees appropriately. \nVerDate Sep2014 20:10 Apr 08, 2024 Jkt 262001 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\09APR3.SGM 09APR3ddrumheller on DSK120RN23PROD with RULES3\n25045 Federal Register / Vol. 89, No. 69 / Tuesday, April 9, 2024 / Rules and Regulations \nVI. Procedural Issues and Regulatory \nReview \nA. Severability \nIf any of the provisions of this final \nrule is held to be invalid or \nunenforceable by its terms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, it shall be severable from its respective section(s) and shall not affect the remainder thereof or the application of the provision to other persons not similarly situated or to other dissimilar circumstances. For example, if a court were to invalidate any portions of this final rule imposing procedural requirements on agencies before moving positions from the competitive service to the excepted service, the other portions of the rule\u2014including the portions providing that employees in the competitive service maintain their protections even if their positions are moved to the excepted service if moved involuntarily\u2014would independently remain workable and valuable. Similarly, the portions of this final rule defining \u2018\u2018confidential, policy- determining, policy-making, or policy- advocating\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018confidential and policy-determining\u2019\u2019 can and would function independently of any of the other portions of this final rule. In enforcing civil service protections and merit system principles, OPM will comply with all applicable legal requirements. \nB. Regulatory Flexibility Act \nThe Director of the Office of \nPersonnel Management certifies that \nthis rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the rule will apply only to Federal agencies and employees. \nC. Regulatory Review \nOPM has examined the impact of this \nrulemaking as required by Executive \nOrders 12866 (Sept. 30, 1993), 13563 (Jan. 18, 2011), and 14094 (Apr. 6, 2023), which direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public, health, and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). A regulatory impact analysis must be prepared for certain rules with effects of $200 million or more in any one year. This rulemaking does not reach that threshold but has otherwise been designated as a \u2018\u2018significant regulatory action\u2019\u2019 under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, as supplemented by Executive Orders \n13563 and 14094. \nD. Executive Order 13132, Federalism \nThis regulation will not have \nsubstantial direct effects on the States, \non the relationship between the National Government and the States, or \non distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 13132 (Aug. 10, 1999), it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. \nE. Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice \nReform \nThis regulation meets the applicable \nstandards set forth in section 3(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 (Feb. 7, 1996). \nF. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n1995 \nThis rulemaking will not result in the \nexpenditure by State, local, or tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of more than $100 million annually. Thus, no written assessment of unfunded mandates is required. \nG. Congressional Review Act \nOMB\u2019s Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs has determined this \nrule does not satisfy the criteria listed in 5 U.S.C. 804(2). \nH. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 \nU.S.C. Chapter 35) \nThis regulatory action will not impose \nany reporting or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act. \nVII.

For exceptions effectuated by Congress, inform OPM of the positions excepted either before the effective date of the provision, if the statutory provisions are not immediately effective, or within 30 days thereafter. \n(6) For exceptions created by the \nPresident or OPM, initiate any hiring actions under the excepted service authority only after OPM publishes any such authorizations in the Federal Register, to include the types, numbers, and locations of the positions moved to the excepted service. \n(c) In accordance with the \nrequirements provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section\u2014 \n(1) An agency that seeks to move an \nencumbered position from the competitive service to the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another, must\u2014 \n(i) Provide written notification to the \nincumbent employee of the intent to move the position 30 days prior to the effective date of the position being moved. \n(ii) In the written notification required \nby paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, if the movement was involuntary, inform the employee that the employee retains any competitive status or procedural and appeal rights previously accrued under chapter 75, subchapter II, or section 4303 of title 5, United States Code, notwithstanding the movement of the position, and inform the employee of appeal rights conferred under \u00a7 302.603 and the timing for exercising such appeal rights. \n(d) In addition to applying to the \nmovement of positions, the requirements of this section apply to the involuntary movement of competitive service or excepted service employees with respect to any earned competitive status, any accrued procedural rights, or depending on the action involved, any appeal rights under chapter 75, subchapter II, or section 4303 of title 5, United States Code, even when moved to the new positions. \n(e) Notwithstanding the use of the \nplural words \u2018\u2018positions,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018employees,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018individuals,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018personnel actions,\u2019\u2019 this section also applies if the directive of the President, Congress, OPM, or a designee thereof affects only one position or one individual. \n\u00a7 302.603 Appeals. \n(a) A competitive service employee \nwhose position is placed into the excepted service or who is otherwise moved involuntarily to the excepted service, or an excepted service employee whose position is placed into a different schedule of the excepted service or who is otherwise involuntarily moved to a position in a different schedule of the excepted service, may directly appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The appeal rights conferred in this section are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any right the individual would otherwise have to appeal a subsequent personnel action undertaken without following appropriate procedures under chapter 75, subchapter II, or section 4303 of title 5, United States Code. \n(b) Where the agency, \nnotwithstanding the requirements of section 302.602 of this part, asserts that the move of the original position or any subsequent position to which the individual is involuntarily moved thereafter will eliminate competitive status or any procedural and appeal rights that had previously accrued, the affected individual may appeal from that determination and request an order directing the agency: \n(1) To correct the notice to provide \nthat any previously accrued status or procedural and appeal rights under those provisions continue to apply; and \n(2) To comply with the requirements \nof either chapter 75, subchapter II or section 4303, title 5, United States Code, in pursuing any action available under those provisions, except to the extent that any such order would be inconsistent with an applicable statute. \n(c) Where the agency fails to comply \nwith \u00a7 302.602(c)(1) of this part and fails to provide the individual with the requisite notice, the affected individual may appeal the failure to provide the requisite notice and request an order directing the agency to comply with that provision. \n(d) An individual may appeal under \nthis part on the basis that: \n(1) A facially voluntary move was \ncoerced or otherwise involuntary; or \n(2) A facially voluntary move to a new \nposition would require the individual to relinquish their competitive status or any civil service protections and the move was coerced or otherwise involuntary. \nPART 432\u2014PERFORMANCE BASED \nREDUCTION IN GRADE AND REMOVAL ACTIONS \n\u25a010.

    "original_comment": "This order wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees and at-will workers to career staff; deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired; and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.  It is a dangerous step backward to a political spoils system that Congress expressly rejected 142 years ago. Staff of the federal agencies secure the nation, safeguard the public health, promote economic growth and protect consumers from fraud. Their jobs require training and expertise in their chosen field so as to provide the best possible service to all Americans, not passing a political loyalty test.The Office of Personnel Management established additional safeguards for employees in the event of an executive action like this and those regulations became final in May 2024.  This order has no right to circumvent these regulations.Civil servants should be focused on their tasks to deliver for the American people and must be protected from arbitrary replacement based on political ideologies, and the corruption that can result from reclassifying them in the same category as political appointees.  The expertise of career civil servants has value and the regulations protecting their employment must not be stripped away to make places for political loyalists who may lack the same expertise and experience of the staff they replace.  The partisan interference that this order advocates in the staffing of federal agencies must be blocked in order to not impair the functioning of these agencies.   Career Federal employees deserve better protection against this treatment and stability in their careers, and they have it in OPM regulations that this order ignores.  The American people deserve agencies staffed with experienced workers that work for their benefit.  This order would strip away their job security and open up the likelihood of being replaced by less qualified staff in order to assert politcal control over the functioning of these agencies.Opposing this is foundational to how we can ensure that the government delivers for people.  That is what a democracy is about.",
