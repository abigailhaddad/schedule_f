    "truncated_text": "I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule titled *\"Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce\"* (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004-0001). Far from promoting accountability, this rule would dangerously politicize the career civil service, subverting the merit principles codified in the **Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)** and undermining constitutional protections that guard against arbitrary and politically motivated employment actions.\n\nThis proposed rule directly conflicts with the core mandates of the **CSRA (5 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq.)**, which enshrines merit system principles as the bedrock of federal employment. Section 2301(b)(8) of the CSRA specifically provides that “employees should be protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes.” The Schedule F framework contemplated by this rule would strip due process protections from potentially thousands of career civil servants—precisely the type of arbitrary, political interference the CSRA was enacted to prevent.\n\nMoreover, the rule attempts to redefine and expand the scope of \"policy-influencing positions\" without statutory authority. Congress has not delegated OPM or the Executive Branch the discretion to bypass civil service protections wholesale by executive fiat. In fact, courts have consistently held that the **nondelegation doctrine** prohibits agencies from arrogating such sweeping powers absent a clear congressional mandate (*Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns*, 531 U.S. 457 (2001)).\n\nThe proposed rule also implicates serious **Fifth Amendment due process concerns**. Federal employees in the competitive service have a constitutionally protected property interest in their continued employment. Removing their protections without individualized due process hearings violates established procedural safeguards (*Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill*, 470 U.S. 532 (1985)). A mass reclassification of career employees to an at-will status would invite widespread litigation and erode public confidence in the federal government’s commitment to constitutional norms.\n\nAdditionally, by consolidating power over hiring and firing into the hands of politically appointed agency heads, this rule raises serious **separation of powers concerns**. It blurs the line between the apolitical implementation of laws by the Executive Branch and partisan control over the machinery of government. A politicized civil service would inhibit Congress's ability to rely on nonpartisan agencies for oversight and undermine the administrative state's legitimacy—an issue the Supreme Court has warned against in cases such as *Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).\n\nThe rule proposed under Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004-0001 is not a restoration of accountability—it is an open invitation to political retaliation, ideological purges, and the dismantling of a merit-based civil service. It contravenes statutory law, violates constitutional protections, and endangers the stability and impartiality of the federal workforce. I urge OPM to reject this rule in its entirety and to stand firm in defense of the apolitical, professional civil service envisioned by the Framers and protected by Congress for over a century.",

Chan School of Public Health. As a researcher with extensive experience in the NIH grant system, I am writing to express significant concerns regarding the section of the proposed rule that designates employees with \"substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking\" as potentially occupying \"policymaking positions\" that could be reclassified under Schedule Policy/Career.\n\nSpecific Concerns with the Proposed Rule\n\nThe proposed rule identifies grant-making as \"an important form of policymaking\" and suggests that employees with \"substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions.\" This characterization fundamentally misunderstands the scientific grant review process at agencies like NIH and NSF, which rely on scientific merit and peer review rather than political considerations.\n\nThe stated purpose of this rule is to allow agencies to \"quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\" When applied to scientific grant-making, this creates a dangerous framework that could politicize what should be an independent, merit-based process.\n\nEvidence-Based Arguments\n\nThe primacy of American scientific research in the world depends on insulating technical grant review from political influence:\n\n1. NIH and NSF grant review processes are designed to fund the most scientifically promising research through rigorous peer review. The NIH is \"arguably the most important institution shaping the rate and direction of scientific research\" with significant implications for human well-being. Even small changes to how funding is allocated could have massive effects on social welfare.\n\n2. International examples demonstrate the severe consequences when politics interferes with scientific funding decisions. Soviet biology, which had achieved peak prominence by the mid-1930s, was essentially ruined by Lysenko's politically-backed campaign against genetics (Ptushenko, Genetics, 2021). The damage was so profound that even after Lysenkoism was officially renounced in 1964, it took decades for Russian science to recover from this political interference.\n\n3. Similarly, in countries like China where \"personal relationships have affected government decisions, such as the review of scientific grants,\" scientific integrity issues have damaged progress despite massive investments (Zeng et al. Dev World Bioeth, 2010). Studies indicate that politicization of science funding leads to inefficient allocation of resources, limiting China's ability to achieve global scientific leadership commensurate with its spending (Shu et al. Minerva, 2022; Yu et al. Res Policy, 2022).\n\n4. The existing peer review system, while imperfect, provides important guardrails against bias. These decisions should be made by scientific experts, not political appointees.\n\nSpecific Recommendations for Improvement\n\nI propose the following improvements to the rule:\n\n1. Explicitly exclude scientific grant review personnel at NIH, NSF, and similar research agencies from the Schedule Policy/Career designation. Scientific merit review is a technical function, not a political one.\n\n2. Provide a clear, narrow definition of what constitutes \"substantive discretionary authority\" in grant-making that distinguishes between technical evaluation based on scientific merit (which should remain protected) and truly discretionary policy decisions.\n\n3. Add specific safeguards ensuring the independence of scientific peer review committees from political interference, including explicit protections for review panel members.\n\n4. Require transparency in any actions that would redesignate positions related to scientific grant review, including advance notice and comment periods specific to each affected role.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile improving accountability in government service is a worthwhile goal, applying at-will employment status to scientific grant-making personnel poses significant risks to American scientific leadership.

In short, I think the rule change would open the civil service up to political influence at the expense of carrying out the law and serving the American taxpayers. I am a federal employee yet these views are my own and do not necessarily represent my agency. I am writing as a concerned citizen and a student of good governance, on my own time.\n\n1. The rule conflates issues around performance and conduct with those of allegiance to policy. From my experience, issues with performance revolve around doing work of poor quality, not adequately fulfilling or understanding the assignment, or otherwise acting in ways that do not serve the mission. Conduct issues concern things like consistently showing up to work late, taking excessive breaks, or acting uncooperatively with colleagues. Issues around not following allegiance to policy are another matter, and would concern things like failing to follow the law or a legal Presidential directive.\n\nI'd like to see the evidence of staff not following laws or Presidential directives. From my experience, staff carry out laws and Presidential directives regardless of whether they agree; and if they don't, they switch jobs or quit on their own. For example, some staff at my agency did not agree with the Executive Order (https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/) which led to the taking down of materials that referenced Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Among other factors, we did not see it as a good use of time. But my agency did it. Similarly, prior administrations have made requests of staff that they may have disagreed with, yet they were carried out.\n\nStaff have been trained that if we have concerns, we comply, and then complain. Historically, staff have had the option of contacting the Office of Special Counsel or Inspectors General offices if they were concerned about waste, fraud, and abuse. As such, it has been disturbing these agencies had agency heads fired so early in the administration.\n\nIf staff are slow-walking or not carrying out directives now, it would behoove the administration to figure out why there has been a change in behavior. I think it's because this administration has represented a departure from legal or democratic ways of conducting government business. For example, various Executive Orders have directed actions which many consider illegal, such as shutting down federal agencies unilaterally, even though Congress has the legal right to pass laws to create or shut down agencies. It is especially troubling now because the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches are all led by the same party, so the administration is acting outside the legal system even when it ostensibly has the support it needs.\n\n2. As for addressing poor performance and conduct, I find that agencies do not use a tool at their disposal which would make their lives much easier: Assigning another manager either to manage a poor performer (from my experience, such performers are rare), or assigning that manager to manage existing staff so the current manager can focus on the poor performer.\n\n3. As it were, the civil service protections are admittedly a double-edged sword. The same protections which protect civil servants from undue political influence -- say, fabricating or withholding data to make an administration look better -- also serve to make it difficult to remove them. However, removing these protections makes any administration vulnerable to having the next administration come in and reverse them, thus catching the protection-removing administration in its own web. It would be short-sighted for any administration to remove these protections.\n\nThank you for your consideration of my comments.\nRich Levy",

But that is not the reason that I am concerned about this proposed change in government workers. Please do not cause more instability in our country. \n\nDo not fire any more government workers. Do not reclassify any government workers. We are losing valuable expertise and skilled workers, gaining nothing in return. Do not add a Schedule F to the government. \n\nThank you.\nCorinne",

    "truncated_text": "Dear Office of Personnel Management:\n\nI write to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule entitled \"Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\", published on April 23, 2025. The proposal seeks to exempt a newly defined category of “Schedule Policy/Career” positions from the statutory protections of 5 U.S.C. Chapters 43 and 75, including the right to appeal adverse personnel actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). This proposal is inconsistent with governing federal statutes and exceeds the scope of executive authority.\n\n1. Statutory Protections Cannot Be Waived by Regulation\n\nCongress has clearly and intentionally established a legal framework that governs performance-based and adverse actions affecting federal employees. Under 5 U.S.C. §§ 4303 and 7513, covered employees are entitled to procedural protections, including advance notice, an opportunity to respond, and the ability to appeal to the MSPB. These protections were codified by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), which replaced earlier patchwork systems with a unified statutory framework. These rights are not discretionary, nor can they be modified or withdrawn by regulation.\n\nWhile the statute (5 U.S.C. § 7511(b)(2)) allows for the exclusion of certain positions from Chapter 75, such as political appointees or positions designated as “confidential or policy-determining,” it does not authorize the wholesale transfer of career civil service employees into newly created at-will categories through regulatory action. The authority to exclude positions from Chapter 75 is limited in scope and purpose and must be interpreted narrowly to avoid undermining Congress’s express intent.\n\n2. The Proposal Violates the Separation of Powers\n\nBy unilaterally removing procedural protections through the creation of the “Schedule Policy/Career” classification, the Executive Branch is attempting to do through regulation what Congress has expressly prohibited—removing career employees without just cause, due process, or meaningful appeal. This raises significant constitutional concerns under the separation of powers doctrine. The Executive cannot override or nullify Congressional enactments through rulemaking.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that where Congress has created a comprehensive remedial scheme (as with the CSRA), judicial and administrative bodies must follow that framework. The proposed rule contradicts this well-established principle and risks subjecting the Executive Branch to legal challenge on administrative and constitutional grounds.\n\n3. Undermining Merit System Principles\n\nThe proposed rule would have a chilling effect on the integrity and independence of the civil service. Career employees in policy-influencing roles—many of whom are technical experts or senior supervisors—would become vulnerable to arbitrary dismissal, political coercion, or reprisal for faithfully executing laws as enacted by Congress. This undermines 5 U.S.C. § 2301, which mandates that employees be retained based on performance and protected from arbitrary action and personal favoritism.\n\nRemoving these protections does not enhance accountability—it creates a workforce subject to political influence and fear, contrary to the principles that have guided the civil service for over a century.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety. The authority to alter statutory employee protections rests solely with Congress, and any attempt to circumvent that authority via regulation is unlawful and harmful to the public interest. I respectfully request that OPM reconsider this proposed rule in light of its legal and constitutional infirmities.",

This raises significant constitutional concerns under the separation of powers doctrine. The Executive cannot override or nullify Congressional enactments through rulemaking.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that where Congress has created a comprehensive remedial scheme (as with the CSRA), judicial and administrative bodies must follow that framework. The proposed rule contradicts this well-established principle and risks subjecting the Executive Branch to legal challenge on administrative and constitutional grounds.\n\n3. Undermining Merit System Principles\n\nThe proposed rule would have a chilling effect on the integrity and independence of the civil service. Career employees in policy-influencing roles—many of whom are technical experts or senior supervisors—would become vulnerable to arbitrary dismissal, political coercion, or reprisal for faithfully executing laws as enacted by Congress. This undermines 5 U.S.C. § 2301, which mandates that employees be retained based on performance and protected from arbitrary action and personal favoritism.\n\nRemoving these protections does not enhance accountability—it creates a workforce subject to political influence and fear, contrary to the principles that have guided the civil service for over a century.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety. The authority to alter statutory employee protections rests solely with Congress, and any attempt to circumvent that authority via regulation is unlawful and harmful to the public interest. I respectfully request that OPM reconsider this proposed rule in light of its legal and constitutional infirmities.",

A couple such examples are the Signal leaks from Pete Hegseth, for which Hegseth continues to be allowed to share security information on an app and the Head of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, not being able to protect her own purse, passport, and security badge.

The federal work force has been effective at protecting Americans in many ways.  Although their workforce is not perfect, that is true of all workforces so it is not appropriate to change Schedule F.  \n\nThis proposed rule would make these employees at-will by removing access to adverse action procedures or appeals. It would do this in order to allow quickly removing any of these employees for poor performance, misconduct, or subversion of presidential directives.\n\nThis action to politicize the work of tens of thousands of career federal employees will erode the government’s merit-based hiring system and undermine the professional civil service that Americans rely on.\n\nThis is another in a series of deliberate moves by the current administration to corrupt the federal government and replace qualified public servants with political cronies. A couple such examples are the Signal leaks from Pete Hegseth, for which Hegseth continues to be allowed to share security information on an app and the Head of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, not being able to protect her own purse, passport, and security badge.  These are just two examples of political cronyism.  \n\nPoliticizing the career civil service is a threat to our democracy and to the integrity of all the programs and services Americans rely on.  Thus, I strongly object to this proposed rule.",

Their work touches every aspect of American life—from public health, economic indicators, and climate change to education, agriculture, and civil rights enforcement. These professionals must be free to follow the facts wherever they lead. Reclassifying them as at-will employees introduces unacceptable risks of political interference, data manipulation, and suppression of inconvenient truths.\n\nCounting people, protecting public health, and assessing our economy are not partisan acts—they are civic imperatives.

It is not difficult to foresee how this rule would chill scientific speech, reduce retention of federal talent, and erode public trust in government data and services.\nIn a time when evidence-based decision-making is more important than ever, the solution is not to weaken protections for scientists and statisticians, but to reinforce their ability to do their work without fear or favor.\nI respectfully urge you to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety.\n\nSincerely,\nJesse Canchola, MS, PStat\nPrincipal Statistician\nStatCon Consulting",

Only Congress has the constitutional authority to determine the structure and protections of the civil service. Bypassing that authority not only undermines the separation of powers — a foundational principle of our democracy — but also risks eroding public trust in government institutions.\nThe proposal also strips away basic due process rights guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment. It would allow for mass dismissals of career employees without the safeguards of notice, explanation, or appeal, opening the door to political retaliation and cronyism. This is fundamentally un-American and invites constitutional challenges the government is unlikely to withstand.\nBeyond the legal violations, the human cost of this rule would be enormous.

While the stated goals of accountability and democratic responsiveness are important, this rule, in its current form, poses significant risks to the integrity of the civil service and the principles of fairness and due process.\n\nThe removal of Chapter 43 and 75 protections, including Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeals, for a broad category of \"policy-influencing\" career employees is deeply concerning. This action would essentially create a system of at-will employment for a significant portion of the federal workforce, making them vulnerable to arbitrary or politically motivated removal without adequate recourse. The historical context provided in the proposed rule itself highlights the dangers of a purely patronage-based system, which this rule risks resurrecting in a new guise.\n\nWhile the proposal claims to maintain nonpartisan hiring for Schedule Policy/Career positions, the lack of meaningful job security and appeal rights inherently politicizes these roles. Employees in these positions would be incentivized to align themselves with the political preferences of the current administration, rather than providing objective and expert advice based on their professional expertise and the best interests of the public. This could lead to a decline in the quality and impartiality of policy recommendations and the erosion of the institutional knowledge that career civil servants provide.\n\nFurthermore, the definition of \"policy-influencing\" positions appears overly broad and lacks clear, objective criteria. This ambiguity creates the potential for the rule to be applied to a wide range of employees, extending far beyond high-level decision-makers and encompassing individuals whose roles involve technical expertise or the implementation of established policies. Subjecting these dedicated public servants to at-will employment based on such a vague definition is unjust and undermines the principles of a merit-based civil service, where career professionals are selected and retained based on their qualifications and performance, not their political leanings.\n\nThe argument that current Chapter 43 and 75 procedures are overly burdensome and impede accountability should be addressed through targeted reforms to those processes, rather than a wholesale removal of fundamental employee protections. Streamlining procedures and ensuring timely resolution of performance issues are legitimate goals, but they should not come at the cost of due process and the creation of a politicized workforce.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge OPM to reconsider this proposed rule. Instead of dismantling essential employee protections and risking the politicization of the civil service, efforts should focus on refining existing performance management systems to ensure both accountability and fairness. The creation of Schedule Policy/Career, without adequate safeguards, represents a dangerous step backward that would undermine the professionalism, independence, and effectiveness of the federal workforce.",

    "truncated_text": "With regard to the proposed OPM rule to politicize the civil service via the Schedule Policy/Career reclassification of federal employees, removing their civil service protections, and rendering them at-will workers, subject to illegal terminations based on baseless political preference. As a concerned American and decorated combat Veteran, I argue that the proposed rule is unlawful, procedurally deficient, and contrary to the public interest, particularly for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The rule should be withdrawn with prejudice immediately based on the following legal rational:\nFirst, it is a violation of Statutory Civil Service Protections. The proposed rule undermines the merit-based civil service system codified in Title 5 of the U.S. Code, particularly 5 U.S.C. § 2301, which mandates that federal employment be based on merit principles, free from political influence. By reclassifying employees in “policy-influencing” roles as at-will workers, the rule effectively nullifies protections against arbitrary dismissal, violating 5 U.S.C. § 7511, which guarantees adverse action procedures for competitive and excepted service employees. For VHA employees, the rule also conflicts with Title 38 protections (38 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.), which prioritize stable staffing to ensure quality veteran healthcare. The Department of Veterans Affairs’ planned reduction of 83,000 jobs, tied to this rule, risks destabilizing VHA operations, contravening Congress’s intent to prioritize veterans’ care. \n\nSecond, this rule is a violation of the Arbitrary and Capricious clause under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), agency actions must not be arbitrary or capricious. The proposed rule fails to provide a reasoned basis for reclassifying employees, relying on vague criteria for “policy-influencing” positions that lack clear standards, and are subject to the whims of political sycophants. OPM’s estimate of impacting ~50,000 employees, including VHA administrative staff, is unsupported by data demonstrating how these roles undermine agency efficiency or necessitate at-will status. The rule also ignores the chilling effect on employee morale and recruitment, particularly in VHA, where staffing shortages already impair care delivery. OPM’s failure to analyze alternatives, such as targeted performance management reforms, renders the rule arbitrary and capricious.\nThird, your insufficient comment period violates is a procedural deficiency in the Rule making process. The APA requires meaningful public participation (5 U.S.C. § 553). The 30-day comment period, ending May 23, 2025, is insufficient for a rule with such far-reaching consequences, especially given OPM’s bypassing of standard regulatory steps (e.g., declaring Biden-era protections inoperative). This curtailed process limits stakeholders, including Veterans, from fully assessing the rule’s impact. Additionally, OPM has not disclosed sufficient data on affected positions or economic impacts, violating APA transparency requirements.\nThe rule jeopardizes the public interest by politicizing the federal workforce, undermining 5 U.S.C. § 1103’s mandate for OPM to uphold merit principles. For VHA, the rule’s alignment with the VA’s August 2025 RIF threatens healthcare access for veterans, as administrative roles are critical to clinical operations. This conflicts with Congressional directives in the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to prioritize veteran services. The rule’s reliance on Project 2025’s privatization goals further suggests an intent to weaken public institutions, contrary to Congress’s commitment to a robust VA.\nAdditionally, the rule raises due process concerns under the Fifth Amendment by depriving employees of protected property interests in their jobs without adequate notice or hearing. Reclassification to at-will status, followed by potential termination without appeal rights, denies procedural protections established in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill (1985). This is particularly egregious for VHA employees with veteran status, who are entitled to hiring and retention preferences under 5 U.S.C. § 2108.\nTo conclude, your rule is blatantly unlawful, procedurally flawed, and detrimental to the federal workforce and veterans’ care. OPM should withdraw the rule or, at minimum, extend the comment period, provide detailed impact analyses, and revise the rule to comply with Title 5, Title 38, and APA requirements. I urge OPM to prioritize merit-based employment and protect VHA’s ability to serve veterans.",

    "truncated_text": "Dear Office of Personnel Management,\nI am writing to express serious concerns regarding the proposed rule to create Schedule Policy/Career positions within the excepted service. While I understand the stated goal of enhancing accountability, this rule is fundamentally flawed legally and as a matter of policy. Below, I outline specific issues related to statutory conflicts, constitutional challenges, procedural deficiencies, and broader policy implications.\n \n1. Conflict with Statutory Protections\nThe proposed rule appears to contravene several provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), which established a uniform framework for employee protections. Specifically:\n•Adverse Action Rights: By excluding Schedule Policy/Career employees from Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5, the rule strips them of procedural safeguards, including the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeal rights. This exclusion undermines Congress’s intent to provide federal employees with due process and fair treatment, as affirmed in cases like United States v. Fausto (484 U.S. 439 [1988]).\n•Merit System Principles: The merit system principles enshrined in Title 5, Section 2301(b), emphasize nonpartisan retention based on performance. Converting these roles into at-will positions risks politicization, directly contravening these principles.\n \n2. Constitutional Concerns\n•Fifth Amendment – Due Process: The removal of appeal rights infringes upon employees’ constitutional property interests in their jobs, as recognized in Arnett v. Kennedy (416 U.S. 134 [1974]). This lack of due process poses significant constitutional challenges.\n•First Amendment – Free Speech: Creating at-will positions could have a chilling effect on employees’ ability to express dissenting or critical views, even outside their professional duties. Such policies risk violating precedents like Pickering v. Board of Education (391 U.S. 563 [1968]), which protect employees’ rights to free expression.\n \n3. Violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\n•Lack of Rational Basis: The rule's justification relies on anecdotal evidence rather than a robust analysis of systemic challenges. The cited difficulties in addressing poor performance and misconduct are not substantiated with comprehensive data, falling short of the APA’s requirement for reasoned decision-making (Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29 [1983]).\n•Arbitrary and Capricious Action: The rule’s sweeping changes ignore less intrusive alternatives for addressing performance issues. This lack of proportionality may render the rule arbitrary under the APA.\n•Insufficient Public Engagement: If comments are inadequately addressed or the decision appears predetermined, it could lead to procedural violations, further invalidating the rule.\n \n4. Policy Implications\n•Undermining Nonpartisanship: Federal employment is merit-based, a cornerstone of public trust in government. This rule risks politicizing critical roles by allowing terminations based on subjective evaluations, which could erode that trust.\n•\tImpact on Workforce Morale and Recruitment: Moving key positions to at-will status may create a culture of fear and instability, deterring highly qualified professionals from seeking public service roles. This could significantly weaken the federal government’s institutional expertise over time.\n•Unintended Consequences: The rule may foster a toxic work environment by discouraging whistleblowing and incentivizing compliance over ethical or professional judgment, potentially diminishing overall efficiency and accountability.\n\nThe proposed rule poses substantial legal and policy challenges. It undermines statutory protections, raises constitutional concerns, and conflicts with the core principles of the civil service. Furthermore, it negatively affects workforce morale, public trust, and government efficiency.\n\nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to withdraw this proposed rule and instead explore alternative measures that address performance challenges without compromising legal protections or the integrity of the federal workforce.",

By carving approximately 50,000 positions out from longstanding civil service protections, this change opens the door to politicized firings rather than performance-based actions.

Punitive reclassification is a blunt instrument that fails to address genuine performance issues and instead invites politically motivated dismissals.\n\nFor these reasons, I oppose the proposed rule and request that OPM uphold the merit-based civil service system.

By politicizing these jobs, you create an environment where the laws and regulations that appeal to each party can be emphasized and funded, while the ones that do not align with the administration in charge are defunded and disbanded. The American people are then eft with an abundance of confusion about what they can count on from each Agency. The American people deserve better than that! They deserve a consistent, well-serving Federal workforce made up of people from all walks of life and all political, economic, and racial groups. When the Federal workforce is aligned like the populace they serve, the service is fairer, and more consistent. And by not switching priorities every 2-4 years, the populace will know what to expect and how the Federal workforce will serve them at the present and into the future. This creates a secure America!\nFor example: if a person wanted to open a business that would distribute food products across the country. They would be subject to Federal FDA rules. If the current administration didn't want, or didn't fund a robust inspection program to enforce the rules, the business owner might open their business without the food protections that cost them considerable money. The food could be harmful and the American people could be at risk of getting sick. But even if that doesn't come to pass, if a differently aligned political party comes into power 2-4 years later, and a robust inspection program is funded, the new business owner could get inspected and found to be deficient. NOW they have to put in equipment or process that cost money, perhaps money they don't have. They were caught in an uncertain business climate and now they may have to take out loans to cover the cost or dip into the business's cash, or raise prices, or go out of business. This scenario can be thought through in the opposite direction, as well. Either way, it isn't fair to the business owner, the consumers, or the investors. \nAnother scenario: A young person who loves working in the outdoors considers a job at the National Park Service after high school. Due to a learning disability, they do not do well in a school setting and are sure that college is not for them. But they have a service-minded personality and would be thrilled to work in a National Park, cleaning up after disrespectful tourists, manning a booth taking admission fees, maintaining trails and assisting with conservation efforts. When this person graduates from high school, the political climate is favorable to become a NPS employee and they take a job with the NPS. After a number of years doing exceptional work, this person marries, buys a house, has children and enjoys the security of the job. But after a number of years, a new political administration comes in that doesn't believe that our National Parks are a treasure to protect and decides that the NPS workforce can be severely reduced and this person is fired (RIF'd). They have no college education and are now unemployed with a mortgage and family to support. Perhaps they could go to a state park to work and make considerably less pay, but they will probably have to take a job that doesn't align with their personality, skills, and experience. This is unfair to the worker. And it is unfair to the American people who want to enjoy our National Parks and need them to be maintained to do so! Having this priority at risk of changing on a whim, is not fair to the American people. Some may have chosen to live near, or spend their money to travel to these parks. They expect a consistent experience and deserve it if they are going to spend their hard-earned money on frequenting them.\nPeople say that this can happen at any job - any company can lay off any worker. But a company is different than a Federal Service. A company is a for-profit entity that needs to do what it has to - to stay in business. Federal Agencies are not for-profit companies. The American government is NOT a for-profit company. And it shouldn't be treated as such. Yes, the government should run as efficiently as possible, but service consistency MUST be maintained. Hiring and firing people at the will of each political party will destroy consistency. \nYes, the Federal deficit is huge!

This proposed change appears to inject political considerations into personnel decisions, creating an environment where career employees in critical roles could be removed for reasons other than poor performance or misconduct, specifically for perceived disloyalty to an administration's policy directives. This politicization would erode the professional independence of the civil service and lead to instability and a loss of valuable expertise within government agencies.\n\nThe lack of clear and objective criteria for defining \"policy-influencing\" positions raises concerns that this could be applied too broadly, impacting a significant number of dedicated civil servants who are not in the most senior policymaking roles. The loss of due process protections for these employees would be a significant step backward in ensuring fair treatment and job security within the federal workforce.\n\nSpecific aspects of the proposed rule undermine the ability of policy advisors and agency leaders to fulfill their essential duties:\n\nUndermining the Obligation to Highlight Legal Conflicts: This rule could undermine policy advisors' fundamental obligation to thoroughly analyze and highlight potential conflicts between proposed presidential directives and existing laws, regulations, and legal precedents. The fear of being seen as \"intentionally undermining\" a directive could discourage advisors from providing critical, objective legal assessments, potentially leading to ill-conceived or legally challenged policies.\n\nJeopardizing Careers for Respecting Legal Authority: The proposed rule jeopardizes the careers of dedicated policy makers who, in upholding their oath and the rule of law, respect congressional veto overrides or comply with court orders that directly oppose presidential directives. An employee should not face the threat of termination for adhering to the legal framework of our government. This rule creates a dangerous precedent where loyalty to a directive could be prioritized over the obligation to respect the balance of powers.\n\nCompromising Congressional oversight and the Independence of Agency Heads: This proposal compromises the intended role and independence of agency heads who are often approved by Congress and mandated to maintain a degree of autonomy to effectively carry out their agencies' missions. The fear of being deemed to be undermining a presidential directive could pressure these leaders to prioritize political alignment over their statutory obligations and professional judgment, ultimately hindering the effective functioning of government.\n\nMoreover, I want to emphasize that processes already exist within our system of governance to prevent federal employees from subverting the intention of laws and regulations. Mechanisms like the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provide checks to ensure agency actions align with legislative intent and established procedures. The proposed rule appears to disregard these existing robust frameworks designed to ensure accountability and prevent overreach.\n\nFinally, the definition of “policy making or policy influencing” positions in the proposed rule is excessively broad and dangerously open to abuse. Without clear and specific criteria, this designation could be applied arbitrarily to a wide range of career civil servants, including those whose roles have limited direct influence on high-level policy decisions. This lack of precision creates the potential for politically motivated reclassifications and subsequent removals, undermining the merit-based principles of the civil service.\n\nThis proposed rule, if implemented, would not only politicize the civil service but also create a chilling effect on objective policy analysis, undermine the rule of law within the executive branch, and compromise the necessary independence of agency leadership. It also disregards existing accountability mechanisms and relies on an overly broad and abusable definition.\n\nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to carefully consider these critical points and abandon this ill-conceived proposal. A robust and effective government relies on a civil service that is both accountable and empowered to provide objective advice and uphold the legal framework of our nation without fear of political reprisal.",

With such an expedited turnaround from E.O. to proposal, and no substantive discussion on the economic impacts of this rule, which would seem to be significant in terms of potential mass-firings over time, it appears not.\nSecondly, it’s laughable hypocritical that an administration unabashedly dedicated to tit-for-tat patronage in political and staff level appointments (e.g., the DOGE employees selected by Elon Musk, and unelected special employee, now embedded across departments) would pretend to be so concerned with such activities occurring at the lowest levels of government. And the evidence that there are parties attempting to “resist” from within is weak at best, and frankly displays zero understanding of the actual workings of federal agencies, and their dedicated career staff. \nThird, the reliance on a walk through history beginning in the 1800s (when black people were enslaved, women had no rights, and workers would routinely die on the job needlessly due to lack of basic safety requirements) is sad. If you think the 1800s, early 1900s, etc. are the benchmark society that we American citizens want to live in now, please disabuse yourselves of that notion. The forward movement in the laws of the 1960s and 1970s, a time when equality and fairness was finally being paid attention to on a national political level are why those laws should stand, and the protections under those laws via the regulations for civil service protections are good.\nFinally, I do believe that it is difficult to ultimately fire certain employees in the civil service, but I do not believe the issue is with the protections they are offered. Rather, I believe that there is a lack of accountability from the top down to address poor performers according to the rules and processes available. A reform at the agency level to ensure existing responsible managers are following the rules that exist would be a more effective and circumspect approach to poor performers.\nIt is also not clear at what level the ability to fire newly at-will employees would reside. Only managers with direct knowledge of an employees duties and performance should have that ability. This rule does not make that clear.\nGo back to the drawing board and study current law, GAO reports, and IG reports to understand how to address the issue of accountability you claim is the goal of this rule. Of course, I don’t think that is the goal, given the backdrop it is proposed against, of mass-firings across government with unfounded or ill-founded reasoning.",
