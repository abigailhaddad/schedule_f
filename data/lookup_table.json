Congress has not delegated OPM or the Executive Branch the discretion to bypass civil service protections wholesale by executive fiat. In fact, courts have consistently held that the **nondelegation doctrine** prohibits agencies from arrogating such sweeping powers absent a clear congressional mandate (*Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns*, 531 U.S. 457 (2001)).\n\nThe proposed rule also implicates serious **Fifth Amendment due process concerns**. Federal employees in the competitive service have a constitutionally protected property interest in their continued employment. Removing their protections without individualized due process hearings violates established procedural safeguards (*Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill*, 470 U.S. 532 (1985)). A mass reclassification of career employees to an at-will status would invite widespread litigation and erode public confidence in the federal government\u2019s commitment to constitutional norms.\n\nAdditionally, by consolidating power over hiring and firing into the hands of politically appointed agency heads, this rule raises serious **separation of powers concerns**. It blurs the line between the apolitical implementation of laws by the Executive Branch and partisan control over the machinery of government. A politicized civil service would inhibit Congress's ability to rely on nonpartisan agencies for oversight and undermine the administrative state's legitimacy\u2014an issue the Supreme Court has warned against in cases such as *Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).\n\nThe rule proposed under Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004-0001 is not a restoration of accountability\u2014it is an open invitation to political retaliation, ideological purges, and the dismantling of a merit-based civil service. It contravenes statutory law, violates constitutional protections, and endangers the stability and impartiality of the federal workforce. I urge OPM to reject this rule in its entirety and to stand firm in defense of the apolitical, professional civil service envisioned by the Framers and protected by Congress for over a century.",

Recent leaked Schedule F lists from NOAA disproportionately identify scientists and science leadership, rather than people who make policy! 2) Accountability must apply across the board and not just middle-management, which is what this will ultimately affect not the low performing employee, but likely the high performing boss of that employee, concurrently, very senior leadership or senior executives will engage in self preservation will be further politicized and become corrupt and divorced from the mission. All you will get is a fearful and incompetent workforce, which is perhaps what this regulation aims to do, and 3) Due process is built into every regulation/law in the United States, and violating the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) covering due process.",

This reclassification effort is a huge over-reach by the Executive Branch which will undermine the federal workforce and reduce public trust in government. \n\nAnother reason given for changing civil servants to at-will employees is that the current protections employees enjoy (e.g., a fair workplace) purportedly makes it difficult \"to hold employees accountable.\" If that is the case, improve the evaluation system. \n\nThe drafters of this rule assert that \"positions will remain career jobs filled on a non-partisan basis.\" This is a disingenuous claim. At-will employment undermines career employment. Job security and due process for employees are critical assurances to those who seek a career job in the federal government. These do not rule out a robust training and evaluation program to ensure good job performance. \n\nIn addition, the assertion that one can be fired without due process for \"intentionally subverting Presidential directives\" undermines the professional, non-partisan character of civil service positions. The message is clear. Obey or be gone. No professional person would choose to work under such conditions. Our government has long upheld model employment regulations.

Schedule F sought to streamline terminations based on the type of work that an employee performs, not based on how well the employee performs. It is therefore difficult to understand how Schedule F can be reconciled with its purported aim of addressing poor performance.\u201d  89 FR 24995\n\nIn my opinion it is not \u201cdifficult to understand\u201d how reclassification addresses poor performance, it makes no rational sense whatsoever.  \n\nI am 74 years old and retired.  I receive Social Security based on my 40 years of work and rely on Medicare for health insurance coverage.  It is very important to me that the Social Security Administration employs reliable, knowledgeable employees and that human beings in the office are accessible by telephone, in person and online.  \n\nI have always paid my taxes and believe that it is a responsibility of everyone who lives in this country to pay his or her fair share of taxes.  I rely on the Internal Revenue Service to promptly review my annual returns and promptly issue whatever refund I may be entitled to.  It is important to me that the I.R.S. be fully staffed with reliable, knowledgeable employees.\n\nAs I age, I recognize more and more how important scientific and medical research is for the health of my children and grandchildren.   My family and I will be adversely affected if research is slowed into preventative and curative therapies for respiratory viruses and infections, stroke recovery, cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and other diseases and conditions that directly impact my life.  I rely on the Department of Health and Human Resources to be fully staffed with reliable and knowledgeable employees.\n\nI do not trust that the proposed rule will improve the delivery of services by expert and experienced employees.

    "comment_text": "Comment on Proposed Rule: \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" (Docket Number: RIN 3206-AO72)\n\nIntroduction\n\nI am submitting this comment as an academic physician-scientist with more than a decade of experience conducting NIH-funded research at Massachusetts General Hospital with appointments at Harvard Medical School and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. As a researcher with extensive experience in the NIH grant system, I am writing to express significant concerns regarding the section of the proposed rule that designates employees with \"substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking\" as potentially occupying \"policymaking positions\" that could be reclassified under Schedule Policy/Career.\n\nSpecific Concerns with the Proposed Rule\n\nThe proposed rule identifies grant-making as \"an important form of policymaking\" and suggests that employees with \"substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions.\" This characterization fundamentally misunderstands the scientific grant review process at agencies like NIH and NSF, which rely on scientific merit and peer review rather than political considerations.\n\nThe stated purpose of this rule is to allow agencies to \"quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\" When applied to scientific grant-making, this creates a dangerous framework that could politicize what should be an independent, merit-based process.\n\nEvidence-Based Arguments\n\nThe primacy of American scientific research in the world depends on insulating technical grant review from political influence:\n\n1. NIH and NSF grant review processes are designed to fund the most scientifically promising research through rigorous peer review. The NIH is \"arguably the most important institution shaping the rate and direction of scientific research\" with significant implications for human well-being. Even small changes to how funding is allocated could have massive effects on social welfare.\n\n2. International examples demonstrate the severe consequences when politics interferes with scientific funding decisions. Soviet biology, which had achieved peak prominence by the mid-1930s, was essentially ruined by Lysenko's politically-backed campaign against genetics (Ptushenko, Genetics, 2021). The damage was so profound that even after Lysenkoism was officially renounced in 1964, it took decades for Russian science to recover from this political interference.\n\n3. Similarly, in countries like China where \"personal relationships have affected government decisions, such as the review of scientific grants,\" scientific integrity issues have damaged progress despite massive investments (Zeng et al. Dev World Bioeth, 2010). Studies indicate that politicization of science funding leads to inefficient allocation of resources, limiting China's ability to achieve global scientific leadership commensurate with its spending (Shu et al. Minerva, 2022; Yu et al. Res Policy, 2022).\n\n4. The existing peer review system, while imperfect, provides important guardrails against bias. These decisions should be made by scientific experts, not political appointees.\n\nSpecific Recommendations for Improvement\n\nI propose the following improvements to the rule:\n\n1. Explicitly exclude scientific grant review personnel at NIH, NSF, and similar research agencies from the Schedule Policy/Career designation. Scientific merit review is a technical function, not a political one.\n\n2. Provide a clear, narrow definition of what constitutes \"substantive discretionary authority\" in grant-making that distinguishes between technical evaluation based on scientific merit (which should remain protected) and truly discretionary policy decisions.\n\n3. Add specific safeguards ensuring the independence of scientific peer review committees from political interference, including explicit protections for review panel members.\n\n4. Require transparency in any actions that would redesignate positions related to scientific grant review, including advance notice and comment periods specific to each affected role.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile improving accountability in government service is a worthwhile goal, applying at-will employment status to scientific grant-making personnel poses significant risks to American scientific leadership. The independence of the scientific grant-making process from political influence has been a cornerstone of American research excellence and must be preserved.",

Conduct issues concern things like consistently showing up to work late, taking excessive breaks, or acting uncooperatively with colleagues. Issues around not following allegiance to policy are another matter, and would concern things like failing to follow the law or a legal Presidential directive.\n\nI'd like to see the evidence of staff not following laws or Presidential directives. From my experience, staff carry out laws and Presidential directives regardless of whether they agree; and if they don't, they switch jobs or quit on their own. For example, some staff at my agency did not agree with the Executive Order (https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/) which led to the taking down of materials that referenced Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Among other factors, we did not see it as a good use of time. But my agency did it. Similarly, prior administrations have made requests of staff that they may have disagreed with, yet they were carried out.\n\nStaff have been trained that if we have concerns, we comply, and then complain. Historically, staff have had the option of contacting the Office of Special Counsel or Inspectors General offices if they were concerned about waste, fraud, and abuse. As such, it has been disturbing these agencies had agency heads fired so early in the administration.\n\nIf staff are slow-walking or not carrying out directives now, it would behoove the administration to figure out why there has been a change in behavior. I think it's because this administration has represented a departure from legal or democratic ways of conducting government business. For example, various Executive Orders have directed actions which many consider illegal, such as shutting down federal agencies unilaterally, even though Congress has the legal right to pass laws to create or shut down agencies. It is especially troubling now because the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches are all led by the same party, so the administration is acting outside the legal system even when it ostensibly has the support it needs.\n\n2. As for addressing poor performance and conduct, I find that agencies do not use a tool at their disposal which would make their lives much easier: Assigning another manager either to manage a poor performer (from my experience, such performers are rare), or assigning that manager to manage existing staff so the current manager can focus on the poor performer.\n\n3. As it were, the civil service protections are admittedly a double-edged sword. The same protections which protect civil servants from undue political influence -- say, fabricating or withholding data to make an administration look better -- also serve to make it difficult to remove them. However, removing these protections makes any administration vulnerable to having the next administration come in and reverse them, thus catching the protection-removing administration in its own web. It would be short-sighted for any administration to remove these protections.\n\nThank you for your consideration of my comments.\nRich Levy",

Recommend at minimum limiting the policy change to locations where this would not create a conflict between federal policy and state/local law.\n\n2) CBO analysis shows that on average public employees are paid less than private employees, with an average pay disparity of 24% (https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60235). This pay disparity is partially compensated for by the promise of secure benefits and relatively stable employment. In order to ensure a minimum level of quality service for the American public, should this policy change be approved, it must be paired with tying federal pay to more closely track the equivalent pays in private sector, ideally through an objective measure of pay overall, or by matching pay for similar fields. Inequality of pay has, similar to the limit of supervisory abilities to remove underperforming employees, been a significant concern for adequate staffing for many decades. Solving one issue without resolving the other will result in a significant negative impact to the ability to staff government with qualified and motivated employees.\n\nI appreciate the thoughtful and robust research invested in the policy document in question, and hope the concerns regarding curtailing rights and undermining the basic pillars of effective manpower are resolved expeditiously.",

Therefore, it is important to me to ensure that the National Institutes of Health remains an organization that continues to fund excellent science, in addition to carrying out groundbreaking research within the institute itself.\n\nI would like to comment on the part of this regulation removes protections from civil servants in order to make them easier to fire. I believe that this would be a grave mistake and am opposed to this change. I believe that allowing this change to go through would remove many nonpartisan experts from our federal agencies and would replace them with political appointees. In the context of the NIH, this would be disastrous because it would remove scientists who are renowned in their fields with decades of experience and replace them with political appointees who are interested in carrying out an ideological agenda, namely censorship of research and information that they believe is hostile to right wing causes. In the last months, we have seen the haphazard way in which the National Institutes of Health has terminated many active grants, in fields such as HIV, mRNA vaccines and more. The termination of vaccine-related grants is particularly troubling to me because the skepticism of mRNA vaccines is a result of right wing misinformation and is not based on solid research. I worry that if the NIH continues not to fund many promising areas of research in order to promote a political agenda, the discovery of cures for deadly diseases like cancer and Alzheimers will be delayed. \n\nFurthermore, science is a discipline that requires a lot of training and nuance and replacing experts with novices who are not equipped to make careful scientific decisions will harm the longterm prospects of this country. I know that the rule says that fired civil servants will be replaced with nonpartisans but all of the evidence I have seen so far, does not make me trust the administration when it comes to this statement. For example, the chief of staff of the NIH Director, a position that has always been held by a scientist was recently transferred to Seana Cranston, who is not a scientist but is instead a political operative who has worked with Representative Thomas Massie and Senator Rand Paul. Furthermore, the haphazard nature of the decisions made by the NIH under the Trump administration does not give me confidence that nonpartisan scientists who are fired will be replaced by skilled experts. For example, in an attemot to defund research which is \"DEI\", many important clinical trials testing drugs for diseases like Stage 4 breast cancer have been defunded, simply because they included an LGBTQ participant within the trial. We have also heard of the cancellation of research grants involving domestic partner violence, an issue which affects many women, but which the administration deemed \"unnecessary\" for a reason that is much more likely to be political rather than scientific. \n\nLastly, I am worried that if the status of these civil servants changes to being at-will, then Trump administration officials will be able to fire these employees for speaking out against unlawful orders or acting as whistleblowers. This would severely reduce the autonomy of even nonpartisan experts to carry out their jobs and make decisions that are best for science, even if they are at odds with the wishes of the administration.\n\nTherefore, it is my recommendation that these changes not go through and that civil service protections for civil servants remain in place. \n\nThank you.",

Employees generally seamlessly support new Administration's priorities but take their oath to the Constitution seriously - if it's legal, they will pivot accordingly; if it's not legal or if it's reckless, they will speak up on behalf of the American public. This is critical for transparency of the government and for the rule of law. Another point I want to make is that if one Administration creates a new office, another Administration can already easily move those employees and even have them do similar work supporting their own policies. Government workers already must choose between implementing new policies or leaving, unless they are asked to do something inappropriate in which case they should be able to freely speak. It's critical that the government workforce remain neutral and lawful and represent the public and the Constitution. Otherwise, there is the danger of a repeat of the Harding days with government employees working for political bosses rather than the American people. The lack of continuity in the workforce will be dangerous as well, especially since policies and procedures are often reinvented years later, and there will be no institutional knowledge of how to manage these changes or what the benefits and costs are. Whatever politicians decide, it's important that they have all the facts and are aware of the unintended consequences of policy changes.",

Chapters 43 and 75, including the right to appeal adverse personnel actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). This proposal is inconsistent with governing federal statutes and exceeds the scope of executive authority.\n\n1. Statutory Protections Cannot Be Waived by Regulation\n\nCongress has clearly and intentionally established a legal framework that governs performance-based and adverse actions affecting federal employees. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4303 and 7513, covered employees are entitled to procedural protections, including advance notice, an opportunity to respond, and the ability to appeal to the MSPB. These protections were codified by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), which replaced earlier patchwork systems with a unified statutory framework. These rights are not discretionary, nor can they be modified or withdrawn by regulation.\n\nWhile the statute (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(b)(2)) allows for the exclusion of certain positions from Chapter 75, such as political appointees or positions designated as \u201cconfidential or policy-determining,\u201d it does not authorize the wholesale transfer of career civil service employees into newly created at-will categories through regulatory action. The authority to exclude positions from Chapter 75 is limited in scope and purpose and must be interpreted narrowly to avoid undermining Congress\u2019s express intent.\n\n2. The Proposal Violates the Separation of Powers\n\nBy unilaterally removing procedural protections through the creation of the \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d classification, the Executive Branch is attempting to do through regulation what Congress has expressly prohibited\u2014removing career employees without just cause, due process, or meaningful appeal. This raises significant constitutional concerns under the separation of powers doctrine. The Executive cannot override or nullify Congressional enactments through rulemaking.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that where Congress has created a comprehensive remedial scheme (as with the CSRA), judicial and administrative bodies must follow that framework. The proposed rule contradicts this well-established principle and risks subjecting the Executive Branch to legal challenge on administrative and constitutional grounds.\n\n3. Undermining Merit System Principles\n\nThe proposed rule would have a chilling effect on the integrity and independence of the civil service. Career employees in policy-influencing roles\u2014many of whom are technical experts or senior supervisors\u2014would become vulnerable to arbitrary dismissal, political coercion, or reprisal for faithfully executing laws as enacted by Congress. This undermines 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301, which mandates that employees be retained based on performance and protected from arbitrary action and personal favoritism.\n\nRemoving these protections does not enhance accountability\u2014it creates a workforce subject to political influence and fear, contrary to the principles that have guided the civil service for over a century.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the reasons stated above, I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety. The authority to alter statutory employee protections rests solely with Congress, and any attempt to circumvent that authority via regulation is unlawful and harmful to the public interest. I respectfully request that OPM reconsider this proposed rule in light of its legal and constitutional infirmities.",

The preamble suggests that this reclassification will address poor performers within government, but does not explain how the \"at will\" status limits firing to poor performers or how the rule will address poor performance in non-policy-making positions.  The rulemaking provides several examples of employees behaving badly, but doesn't explain why existing rules and laws are insufficient to address these problems. The current system does allow federal supervisors to both fire poor performing employees and to encourage them to seek work elsewhere.   \nIn summery this change is counter to statute and ill-advised.",

Furthermore, OPM is bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit-based civil service system principles. Enacting Schedule F runs contradictory to this statute and places political pressure on career employees, undermining the integrity and continuity of federal programs across changing administrations. \n\nSchedule F represents a substantive threat to no only civil service independence, but the law itself. I strongly encourage this administration to review the relevant statutes and laws and reject any regulatory framework that seeks to skirt these codified protections of a merit-based system.",

Their work touches every aspect of American life\u2014from public health, economic indicators, and climate change to education, agriculture, and civil rights enforcement. These professionals must be free to follow the facts wherever they lead. Reclassifying them as at-will employees introduces unacceptable risks of political interference, data manipulation, and suppression of inconvenient truths.\n\nCounting people, protecting public health, and assessing our economy are not partisan acts\u2014they are civic imperatives. This rule, by making experts vulnerable to dismissal based on subjective notions of \"policy influence,\" undermines the very integrity of our federal workforce and threatens the quality and credibility of the data that inform democratic governance.\n\nMoreover, this proposed rule runs counter to the bipartisan Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018, which recognized the vital need for federal data to be collected and used without bias or undue influence. It is not difficult to foresee how this rule would chill scientific speech, reduce retention of federal talent, and erode public trust in government data and services.\nIn a time when evidence-based decision-making is more important than ever, the solution is not to weaken protections for scientists and statisticians, but to reinforce their ability to do their work without fear or favor.\nI respectfully urge you to withdraw this proposed rule in its entirety.\n\nSincerely,\nJesse Canchola, MS, PStat\nPrincipal Statistician\nStatCon Consulting",

I have spent more than 40 years working in health and human services, and throughout my career, I have worked closely with many talented and dedicated federal public servants. I am deeply grateful for their professionalism, expertise, and steadfast commitment to serving the American people, regardless of political pressures. Their work has been critical to advancing public health, safeguarding vulnerable populations, and ensuring government programs function effectively and fairly.\nPoliticizing these essential roles \u2014 particularly in public health and health care \u2014 would not only diminish the quality of government services but could endanger lives. We need experienced, nonpartisan experts leading responses to disease outbreaks, regulating the safety of medicines, and administering critical programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Undermining their independence would slow emergency responses, weaken public protections, and ultimately harm the very people government is meant to serve.\nFor the sake of the Constitution, the integrity of the civil service, and the health and safety of the American people, this proposal must be withdrawn.",

This action would essentially create a system of at-will employment for a significant portion of the federal workforce, making them vulnerable to arbitrary or politically motivated removal without adequate recourse. The historical context provided in the proposed rule itself highlights the dangers of a purely patronage-based system, which this rule risks resurrecting in a new guise.\n\nWhile the proposal claims to maintain nonpartisan hiring for Schedule Policy/Career positions, the lack of meaningful job security and appeal rights inherently politicizes these roles. Employees in these positions would be incentivized to align themselves with the political preferences of the current administration, rather than providing objective and expert advice based on their professional expertise and the best interests of the public. This could lead to a decline in the quality and impartiality of policy recommendations and the erosion of the institutional knowledge that career civil servants provide.\n\nFurthermore, the definition of \"policy-influencing\" positions appears overly broad and lacks clear, objective criteria. This ambiguity creates the potential for the rule to be applied to a wide range of employees, extending far beyond high-level decision-makers and encompassing individuals whose roles involve technical expertise or the implementation of established policies. Subjecting these dedicated public servants to at-will employment based on such a vague definition is unjust and undermines the principles of a merit-based civil service, where career professionals are selected and retained based on their qualifications and performance, not their political leanings.\n\nThe argument that current Chapter 43 and 75 procedures are overly burdensome and impede accountability should be addressed through targeted reforms to those processes, rather than a wholesale removal of fundamental employee protections. Streamlining procedures and ensuring timely resolution of performance issues are legitimate goals, but they should not come at the cost of due process and the creation of a politicized workforce.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge OPM to reconsider this proposed rule. Instead of dismantling essential employee protections and risking the politicization of the civil service, efforts should focus on refining existing performance management systems to ensure both accountability and fairness. The creation of Schedule Policy/Career, without adequate safeguards, represents a dangerous step backward that would undermine the professionalism, independence, and effectiveness of the federal workforce.",

The rule should be withdrawn with prejudice immediately based on the following legal rational:\nFirst, it is a violation of Statutory Civil Service Protections. The proposed rule undermines the merit-based civil service system codified in Title 5 of the U.S. Code, particularly 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301, which mandates that federal employment be based on merit principles, free from political influence. By reclassifying employees in \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d roles as at-will workers, the rule effectively nullifies protections against arbitrary dismissal, violating 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511, which guarantees adverse action procedures for competitive and excepted service employees. For VHA employees, the rule also conflicts with Title 38 protections (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7401 et seq.), which prioritize stable staffing to ensure quality veteran healthcare. The Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 planned reduction of 83,000 jobs, tied to this rule, risks destabilizing VHA operations, contravening Congress\u2019s intent to prioritize veterans\u2019 care. \n\nSecond, this rule is a violation of the Arbitrary and Capricious clause under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), agency actions must not be arbitrary or capricious. The proposed rule fails to provide a reasoned basis for reclassifying employees, relying on vague criteria for \u201cpolicy-influencing\u201d positions that lack clear standards, and are subject to the whims of political sycophants. OPM\u2019s estimate of impacting ~50,000 employees, including VHA administrative staff, is unsupported by data demonstrating how these roles undermine agency efficiency or necessitate at-will status. The rule also ignores the chilling effect on employee morale and recruitment, particularly in VHA, where staffing shortages already impair care delivery. OPM\u2019s failure to analyze alternatives, such as targeted performance management reforms, renders the rule arbitrary and capricious.\nThird, your insufficient comment period violates is a procedural deficiency in the Rule making process. The APA requires meaningful public participation (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553). The 30-day comment period, ending May 23, 2025, is insufficient for a rule with such far-reaching consequences, especially given OPM\u2019s bypassing of standard regulatory steps (e.g., declaring Biden-era protections inoperative). This curtailed process limits stakeholders, including Veterans, from fully assessing the rule\u2019s impact. Additionally, OPM has not disclosed sufficient data on affected positions or economic impacts, violating APA transparency requirements.\nThe rule jeopardizes the public interest by politicizing the federal workforce, undermining 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103\u2019s mandate for OPM to uphold merit principles. For VHA, the rule\u2019s alignment with the VA\u2019s August 2025 RIF threatens healthcare access for veterans, as administrative roles are critical to clinical operations. This conflicts with Congressional directives in the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to prioritize veteran services. The rule\u2019s reliance on Project 2025\u2019s privatization goals further suggests an intent to weaken public institutions, contrary to Congress\u2019s commitment to a robust VA.\nAdditionally, the rule raises due process concerns under the Fifth Amendment by depriving employees of protected property interests in their jobs without adequate notice or hearing. Reclassification to at-will status, followed by potential termination without appeal rights, denies procedural protections established in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill (1985). This is particularly egregious for VHA employees with veteran status, who are entitled to hiring and retention preferences under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108.\nTo conclude, your rule is blatantly unlawful, procedurally flawed, and detrimental to the federal workforce and veterans\u2019 care. OPM should withdraw the rule or, at minimum, extend the comment period, provide detailed impact analyses, and revise the rule to comply with Title 5, Title 38, and APA requirements. I urge OPM to prioritize merit-based employment and protect VHA\u2019s ability to serve veterans.",

Agencies could be emptied of experienced personnel each time the Presidency changes hands, severely disrupting essential services and the government\u2019s ability to function consistently and impartially. This instability would harm not only internal agency operations but also the American public who rely on a stable, competent federal workforce.\n\nThird, the proposal reintroduces the worst elements of the \u201cspoils system\u201d that plagued American governance in the 19th century \u2014 a system the civil service reforms of the late 1800s (particularly the Pendleton Act) were explicitly designed to eliminate. The return to a patronage-based system would invite widespread abuse by the executive branch, with political loyalty prioritized over merit, expertise, and the public interest. It would undo more than a century of progress in creating a professional civil service dedicated to impartial service to the nation, not service to a particular political leader.\n\nIn short, the proposed rule would politicize federal service, destabilize agency operations, and undo critical reforms that have safeguarded the integrity of government for generations.

Conflict with Statutory Protections\nThe proposed rule appears to contravene several provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), which established a uniform framework for employee protections. Specifically:\n\u2022Adverse Action Rights: By excluding Schedule Policy/Career employees from Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5, the rule strips them of procedural safeguards, including the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeal rights. This exclusion undermines Congress\u2019s intent to provide federal employees with due process and fair treatment, as affirmed in cases like United States v. Fausto (484 U.S. 439 [1988]).\n\u2022Merit System Principles: The merit system principles enshrined in Title 5, Section 2301(b), emphasize nonpartisan retention based on performance. Converting these roles into at-will positions risks politicization, directly contravening these principles.\n \n2. Constitutional Concerns\n\u2022Fifth Amendment \u2013 Due Process: The removal of appeal rights infringes upon employees\u2019 constitutional property interests in their jobs, as recognized in Arnett v. Kennedy (416 U.S. 134 [1974]). This lack of due process poses significant constitutional challenges.\n\u2022First Amendment \u2013 Free Speech: Creating at-will positions could have a chilling effect on employees\u2019 ability to express dissenting or critical views, even outside their professional duties. Such policies risk violating precedents like Pickering v. Board of Education (391 U.S. 563 [1968]), which protect employees\u2019 rights to free expression.\n \n3. Violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\n\u2022Lack of Rational Basis: The rule's justification relies on anecdotal evidence rather than a robust analysis of systemic challenges. The cited difficulties in addressing poor performance and misconduct are not substantiated with comprehensive data, falling short of the APA\u2019s requirement for reasoned decision-making (Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29 [1983]).\n\u2022Arbitrary and Capricious Action: The rule\u2019s sweeping changes ignore less intrusive alternatives for addressing performance issues. This lack of proportionality may render the rule arbitrary under the APA.\n\u2022Insufficient Public Engagement: If comments are inadequately addressed or the decision appears predetermined, it could lead to procedural violations, further invalidating the rule.\n \n4. Policy Implications\n\u2022Undermining Nonpartisanship: Federal employment is merit-based, a cornerstone of public trust in government. This rule risks politicizing critical roles by allowing terminations based on subjective evaluations, which could erode that trust.\n\u2022\tImpact on Workforce Morale and Recruitment: Moving key positions to at-will status may create a culture of fear and instability, deterring highly qualified professionals from seeking public service roles. This could significantly weaken the federal government\u2019s institutional expertise over time.\n\u2022Unintended Consequences: The rule may foster a toxic work environment by discouraging whistleblowing and incentivizing compliance over ethical or professional judgment, potentially diminishing overall efficiency and accountability.\n\nThe proposed rule poses substantial legal and policy challenges. It undermines statutory protections, raises constitutional concerns, and conflicts with the core principles of the civil service. Furthermore, it negatively affects workforce morale, public trust, and government efficiency.\n\nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to withdraw this proposed rule and instead explore alternative measures that address performance challenges without compromising legal protections or the integrity of the federal workforce.",

And by not switching priorities every 2-4 years, the populace will know what to expect and how the Federal workforce will serve them at the present and into the future. This creates a secure America!\nFor example: if a person wanted to open a business that would distribute food products across the country. They would be subject to Federal FDA rules. If the current administration didn't want, or didn't fund a robust inspection program to enforce the rules, the business owner might open their business without the food protections that cost them considerable money. The food could be harmful and the American people could be at risk of getting sick. But even if that doesn't come to pass, if a differently aligned political party comes into power 2-4 years later, and a robust inspection program is funded, the new business owner could get inspected and found to be deficient. NOW they have to put in equipment or process that cost money, perhaps money they don't have. They were caught in an uncertain business climate and now they may have to take out loans to cover the cost or dip into the business's cash, or raise prices, or go out of business. This scenario can be thought through in the opposite direction, as well. Either way, it isn't fair to the business owner, the consumers, or the investors. \nAnother scenario: A young person who loves working in the outdoors considers a job at the National Park Service after high school. Due to a learning disability, they do not do well in a school setting and are sure that college is not for them. But they have a service-minded personality and would be thrilled to work in a National Park, cleaning up after disrespectful tourists, manning a booth taking admission fees, maintaining trails and assisting with conservation efforts. When this person graduates from high school, the political climate is favorable to become a NPS employee and they take a job with the NPS. After a number of years doing exceptional work, this person marries, buys a house, has children and enjoys the security of the job. But after a number of years, a new political administration comes in that doesn't believe that our National Parks are a treasure to protect and decides that the NPS workforce can be severely reduced and this person is fired (RIF'd). They have no college education and are now unemployed with a mortgage and family to support. Perhaps they could go to a state park to work and make considerably less pay, but they will probably have to take a job that doesn't align with their personality, skills, and experience. This is unfair to the worker. And it is unfair to the American people who want to enjoy our National Parks and need them to be maintained to do so! Having this priority at risk of changing on a whim, is not fair to the American people. Some may have chosen to live near, or spend their money to travel to these parks. They expect a consistent experience and deserve it if they are going to spend their hard-earned money on frequenting them.\nPeople say that this can happen at any job - any company can lay off any worker. But a company is different than a Federal Service. A company is a for-profit entity that needs to do what it has to - to stay in business. Federal Agencies are not for-profit companies. The American government is NOT a for-profit company. And it shouldn't be treated as such. Yes, the government should run as efficiently as possible, but service consistency MUST be maintained. Hiring and firing people at the will of each political party will destroy consistency. \nYes, the Federal deficit is huge! But trying to balance that by firing federal workers is not an efficient way to do that. The Federal Agencies ALL provide value and increase revenues over the long term. Inefficiencies and unproductive workers should be weeded out, and has been over each political party. But by making Federal workers at-will employees would hurt America over the long-term. \nI do not support changing Federal workers into at-will employees. I think it is a poorly thought out idea that will destroy our American services and hurt ALL Americans.",

This weakens the entire public service system, leading to instability, fear, and loss of experienced staff, which ultimately hurts the public who depend on expert, stable government services.\n\n4. Amending 5 CFR part 210 (Definitions Related to Political Appointments):\nStatement:\nChanging the definition so that career employees can now hold \"policy-influencing\" roles \u2014 once reserved for political appointees \u2014 invites political favoritism into what should be a professional, merit-based civil service.\n\nWhy it should not be implemented:\nThis undermines the tradition that career employees serve the country, not a political agenda. It risks critical decisions being shaped by political loyalty rather than expertise, harming the quality and impartiality of services that the public deserves.\n\n5. Amending 5 CFR part 302 (Procedures for Moving Employees into Policy Positions):\nStatement:\nRemoving rules that provided oversight and appeal rights when moving employees into policy roles guts transparency and makes it easier to sideline or oust employees without fair warning or review.\n\nWhy it should not be implemented:\nWhen movements and staffing changes happen in the shadows, without accountability, corruption and favoritism grow.

    "comment_text": "Office of Personnel Management Proposed Rule \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" - Docket OPM-2025-0004\n\nI am commenting to express my strong and continued opposition to the proposed rule \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service\" as published in the Federal Register (90 FR 17182), Docket OPM-2025-0004.\n\nThe creation of a \"Schedule Policy/Career\" designation for policy-influencing positions, making them at-will and removing standard adverse action procedures and appeal processes, would fundamentally undermine the principles of a nonpartisan and merit-based civil service. This proposed change appears to inject political considerations into personnel decisions, creating an environment where career employees in critical roles could be removed for reasons other than poor performance or misconduct, specifically for perceived disloyalty to an administration's policy directives. This politicization would erode the professional independence of the civil service and lead to instability and a loss of valuable expertise within government agencies.\n\nThe lack of clear and objective criteria for defining \"policy-influencing\" positions raises concerns that this could be applied too broadly, impacting a significant number of dedicated civil servants who are not in the most senior policymaking roles. The loss of due process protections for these employees would be a significant step backward in ensuring fair treatment and job security within the federal workforce.\n\nSpecific aspects of the proposed rule undermine the ability of policy advisors and agency leaders to fulfill their essential duties:\n\nUndermining the Obligation to Highlight Legal Conflicts: This rule could undermine policy advisors' fundamental obligation to thoroughly analyze and highlight potential conflicts between proposed presidential directives and existing laws, regulations, and legal precedents. The fear of being seen as \"intentionally undermining\" a directive could discourage advisors from providing critical, objective legal assessments, potentially leading to ill-conceived or legally challenged policies.\n\nJeopardizing Careers for Respecting Legal Authority: The proposed rule jeopardizes the careers of dedicated policy makers who, in upholding their oath and the rule of law, respect congressional veto overrides or comply with court orders that directly oppose presidential directives. An employee should not face the threat of termination for adhering to the legal framework of our government. This rule creates a dangerous precedent where loyalty to a directive could be prioritized over the obligation to respect the balance of powers.\n\nCompromising Congressional oversight and the Independence of Agency Heads: This proposal compromises the intended role and independence of agency heads who are often approved by Congress and mandated to maintain a degree of autonomy to effectively carry out their agencies' missions. The fear of being deemed to be undermining a presidential directive could pressure these leaders to prioritize political alignment over their statutory obligations and professional judgment, ultimately hindering the effective functioning of government.\n\nMoreover, I want to emphasize that processes already exist within our system of governance to prevent federal employees from subverting the intention of laws and regulations. Mechanisms like the Congressional Review Act (CRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provide checks to ensure agency actions align with legislative intent and established procedures. The proposed rule appears to disregard these existing robust frameworks designed to ensure accountability and prevent overreach.\n\nFinally, the definition of \u201cpolicy making or policy influencing\u201d positions in the proposed rule is excessively broad and dangerously open to abuse. Without clear and specific criteria, this designation could be applied arbitrarily to a wide range of career civil servants, including those whose roles have limited direct influence on high-level policy decisions. This lack of precision creates the potential for politically motivated reclassifications and subsequent removals, undermining the merit-based principles of the civil service.\n\nThis proposed rule, if implemented, would not only politicize the civil service but also create a chilling effect on objective policy analysis, undermine the rule of law within the executive branch, and compromise the necessary independence of agency leadership. It also disregards existing accountability mechanisms and relies on an overly broad and abusable definition.\n\nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to carefully consider these critical points and abandon this ill-conceived proposal. A robust and effective government relies on a civil service that is both accountable and empowered to provide objective advice and uphold the legal framework of our nation without fear of political reprisal.",

And the evidence that there are parties attempting to \u201cresist\u201d from within is weak at best, and frankly displays zero understanding of the actual workings of federal agencies, and their dedicated career staff. \nThird, the reliance on a walk through history beginning in the 1800s (when black people were enslaved, women had no rights, and workers would routinely die on the job needlessly due to lack of basic safety requirements) is sad. If you think the 1800s, early 1900s, etc. are the benchmark society that we American citizens want to live in now, please disabuse yourselves of that notion. The forward movement in the laws of the 1960s and 1970s, a time when equality and fairness was finally being paid attention to on a national political level are why those laws should stand, and the protections under those laws via the regulations for civil service protections are good.\nFinally, I do believe that it is difficult to ultimately fire certain employees in the civil service, but I do not believe the issue is with the protections they are offered. Rather, I believe that there is a lack of accountability from the top down to address poor performers according to the rules and processes available. A reform at the agency level to ensure existing responsible managers are following the rules that exist would be a more effective and circumspect approach to poor performers.\nIt is also not clear at what level the ability to fire newly at-will employees would reside. Only managers with direct knowledge of an employees duties and performance should have that ability. This rule does not make that clear.\nGo back to the drawing board and study current law, GAO reports, and IG reports to understand how to address the issue of accountability you claim is the goal of this rule. Of course, I don\u2019t think that is the goal, given the backdrop it is proposed against, of mass-firings across government with unfounded or ill-founded reasoning.",

Creating this new schedule that allows politicians to remove staff they perceive has having different opinions is not in the best interest of the United States.  We should not take the risk of injustice from passion and prejudice, which no law or regulation can control, when there is already a transparent and effective system to remove civil servants that are not effective.",

This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence. While 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301 grants the President authority to prescribe regulations for the competitive service, it DOES NOT permit blanket reclassification permission, nor removal of due process rights. \n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations. Additionally, the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule's broad reclassification of policy-related roles likely exceeds OPM's regulatory authority under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3302, which requires that exceptions to competitive service rules be \"necessary\" and \"conditions of good administration.\" Courts will likely strike it down as arbitrary and capricious under Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm (1983).\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. It disregards Title 5 protections, congressional intent, and judicial precedent safeguarding merit-based civil service. If implemented, it invites litigation under the CSRA, APA, and Constitutional doctrines, with a high likelihood of being struck down. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

Whether you believe it\nor not, we are here to help you.\nHowever, trust is a two-way street, and OPM has done much to diminish its credibility in the\ninitial months of this administration.4 To the extent OPM is sincere in promising that \u201cemployees\nwho faithfully perform their jobs to the best of their ability have little to fear from Schedule\nPolicy/Career,\u201d5 I urge OPM to implement meaningful safeguards beyond those included in its\nNPRM\u2014in particular, language that would prohibit the arbitrary firing or mass firing of\nSchedule Policy/Career employees. Such safeguards would demonstrate OPM\u2019s sincerity about\nthe stated intent of amended Executive Order 13957\u2014i.e., holding bad actors accountable\u2014\nwhile mitigating some of its harms.\nA Solution in Search of a Problem\nBefore getting into the details of the NPRM, I wish to share my perspective as a federal\nemployee who will likely be reclassified into Schedule Policy/Career, retaining my anonymity\nfor obvious reasons. For context, I previously commented in support of OPM\u2019s 2024 rule and\nwas quoted at length in the preamble of that rule.6\nAs I described in my earlier comment, I am a GS-13 regulatory analyst who works in the \u201cOffice\nof Policy\u201d of a prominent federal agency. For better or worse, my agency engages in some of the\nmost contentious policy work in the federal government. For example, my agency\u2019s policy\npriorities change dramatically depending on the political party in charge of the Presidency. Our\nrulemakings typically attract thousands of comments and have been the subject of Congressional\ncommittee hearings. Adverse stakeholders challenge our rules and sub-regulatory guidance in\ncourt, with disputes occasionally reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. My \u201csubstantive\nparticipation\u201d in this contested policy work is important and exciting,7 but given its sensitivity, I\nam scrupulous to maintain the effort, professionalism, and objectivity expected of a taxpayer-\nfunded federal employee.\nAs a career analyst, I have worked closely and successfully with political appointees under the\nObama, Trump, and Biden administrations to issue regulations and policy guidance consistent\nwith the policy priorities of those administrations. Naturally, I have personal opinions about the\npolicy work I do, and I sometimes disagree with my politically appointed leaders about specific\n4 See, e.g., Eric Katz, As Re-Firings Begin, Judge Demands Trump Administration Tell Probationary\nEmployees They Were Not Let Go for Poor Performance, Politico (April 21, 2025), https://\nwww.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/opm-firing-probationary-federal-agency-employees-judge-\nruling-00206615; Billy Mitchell, OPM Quietly Swapped Out Privacy Assessment for Governmentwide\nEmail System Central to Ongoing Litigation, FedScoop (March 3, 2025), https://fedscoop.com/opm-\nemail-privacy-assessment-swap-ongoing-litigation/.\n5 90 FR 17218.\n6 See 89 FR 25001 (Comment 3195).\n7 E.O. 13957, sec. 5(c)(i).\n2\npolicies or projects. In fact, robust civil service protections have empowered me\u2014and,\ncollectively, my coworkers and other career employees\u2014to occasionally share policy\nrecommendations or serious concerns with agency leadership, which sometimes results in our\nleadership changing course. This is a perfectly normal and healthy process, as career civil\nservants are supposed to provide candid deliberative advice to the politically appointed leaders\nwho ultimately make the decisions. As OPM continues to recognize,8 candid internal feedback\nfrom career policy staff helps to ensure that regulatory changes and other policy initiatives are\nmaximally effective, sustainable, and legally defensible.\nAt the same time, I and other career federal employees certainly understand that we are not the\ndecisionmakers. Elections in a democracy have consequences, and it is entirely appropriate for\nagencies to pursue the policy preferences of the elected President who appoints its leaders. This\nis widely understood by all federal employees, who typically go above and beyond Hatch Act\nrequirements to refrain from appearing politically biased whether we\u2019re on or off the clock.\nSpeaking personally, I have often worked to delay, withdraw, rescind, and/or replace rules that I\nhelped a previous administration to promulgate. Occasionally, I have drafted preamble language\nrebutting the very same language that I personally authored years before in an earlier\nrulemaking. I have also proactively \u201cpitched\u201d policy ideas to agency leadership in every\nPresidential administration, including in this administration. In fact, I and my coworkers have\nalready brainstormed numerous ideas for regulatory relief consistent with the deregulatory aims\nof Executive Orders 14192 and 14219.9\nGiven this experience, I am incredulous at OPM\u2019s assertion that policy resistance is \u201ca\nwidespread phenomenon.\u201d10 This assertion is a reversal from OPM\u2019s findings last year,11 and it\nflies in the face of my personal experience. Sensationalist claims about a widespread \u201cdeep state\u201d\nor \u201cresistance\u201d within the federal civil service simply do not reflect reality. For example, if there\ntruly was widespread \u201cpolicy resistance\u201d against the Trump administration among the 50,000\nemployees who might be reclassified into Schedule Policy/Career, one would expect ubiquitous\nleaks about agency rulemakings and other sensitive policy initiatives to news outlets and adverse\nstakeholders. Here, OPM cites to just one example of a career employee ever leaking a policy\ndocument\u2014a draft Presidential executive order promoting classical and traditional architectural\nstyles in the design of federal buildings.12 This one example, involving a seemingly trivial policy\nissue, does not establish that policy resistance is a \u201cwidespread\u201d phenomenon.13\n8 See 90 FR 17208 (\u201cCareer staff critiques, especially those coming from a political perspective that\ndiffers from political appointees, ultimately strengthens policymaking and produces better agency\ndecisions.\u201d).\n9 See 90 FR 9065 (Executive Order 14192); 90 FR 10583 (Executive Order 14219).\n10 90 FR 17194.\n11 89 FR 25000 (\u201cOPM does not agree that employing civil servants \u2026 thwarts the agenda of any\nPresident, and [such assertions] lack any well-founded support.\u201d).\n12 90 FR 17193 n. 151.\n13 To be clear, I do not condone the actions of that apparently disgruntled architect.\n3\nThe truth is that, like me, the overwhelming majority of career staff respect the integrity of the\npolicymaking process and the importance of deferring to our Presidentially-appointed leaders.\nOPM\u2019s citation to unscientific poll results and a handful of clickbait articles do not make a\npersuasive case to the contrary.\nIn sum, Schedule Policy/Career appears to be a solution in search of a problem. I am not opposed\nto holding bad actors accountable, but I have never witnessed or heard about insubordination or\n\u201cpolicy resistance\u201d at my agency of the kind imagined in the NPRM. So, as a threshold matter, I\ndisagree that there is a problem serious enough to justify stripping civil service protections from\nme and 50,000 other federal employees.\nWeak Protections and Hollow Assurances\nSection 6 of amended Executive Order 13957 provides that \u201c[e]mployees in or applicants for\nSchedule Policy/Career positions are not required to personally or politically support the current\nPresident or the policies of the current administration,\u201d and separately instructs agencies to\n\u201cestablish rules to prohibit the same personnel practices prohibited by [5 U.S.C. 2302(b)] with\nrespect to any employee or applicant for employment in Schedule Policy/Career of the excepted\nservice.\u201d14 Additionally, amended Executive Order 13957 deviates from the original Executive\nOrder 13957 by designating the new schedule as \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d rather than \u201cSchedule\nF\u201d\u2014ostensibly to rebut \u201cmisinformation\u201d that the administration will use the new schedule as \u201ca\nmeans of converting career positions to political positions.\u201d15\nThese protections are better than nothing, but they seem functionally unenforceable. As OPM\nnoted last year:\nOnce hirings and firings are at-will \u2026 [an] employee might not have an\nentitlement to written notice of the reasons for [an] adverse action, an opportunity\nto respond, or a written decision. Nor would the decision generally be appealable.\nIt would thus be, at a minimum, difficult for employees to protect themselves\nfrom actions based on political beliefs or party allegiance because no cause (or\nevidence) would be required prior to such an action. Under Schedule F, because\nsuch an employee would be at-will, the employer would need to give little or no\nreason prior to a termination. In short, Schedule F leaves innumerable ways for\npolitics to factor into these traditionally merit-based decisions in a manner that\nwould be difficult to detect or remedy.16\nEven in its new NPRM, OPM acknowledges the risk that \u201csome [agency] officials\u201d may \u201ctreat\nSchedule Policy/Career positions as noncareer positions\u201d and fire employees for perceived\n14 E.O. 13957, sec. 6.\n15 90 FR 17200.\n16 89 FR 24994 (citations omitted).\n4\npolitical disloyalty.17 In response, OPM replies that it will \u201cbe heavily involved in the\nimplementation of Schedule Policy/Career\u201d and \u201cif necessary \u2026 can recommend additional\nmeasures to prevent abuses.\u201d18 Respectfully, these vague assurances are not good enough. OPM\nis the federal agency with the duty to implement amended Executive Order 13957 and should not\nwait for predictable harms to materialize before merely \u201crecommend[ing]\u201d solutions. Indeed,\nsection 6(a) of amended Executive Order 13957 instructs that \u201cagencies\u201d\u2014including OPM\u2014\n\u201cshall establish rules to prohibit [certain] personnel practices\u201d against Schedule Policy/Career\nemployees,19 but OPM\u2019s NPRM fails to include any language about prohibited personnel\npractices in the proposed reg text for 5 CFR 213.3501.20 At minimum, OPM should fix that\noversight in its final rule.\nOf course, the bigger problem is that nothing in OPM\u2019s NPRM or in the express text of amended\nExecutive Order 13957 will protect Schedule Policy/Career employees from mass firings. As\nOPM notes, \u201cplacing \u2026 employees into Schedule Policy/Career makes them functionally at-\nwill.\u201d21 Thus, as long as agencies do not discriminate when they fire individual employees,\nagency heads will be newly empowered to quickly fire large groups of federal employees for no\nreason at all\u2014as many as 50,000 across the federal government, according to OPM's estimate in\nthe NPRM.22 Contemplating the protections afforded to Schedule Policy/Career employees, one\nis reminded of Joseph Stalin\u2019s infamous distinction between tragedies and statistics.\nIn a tacit acknowledgement of concerns that Schedule Policy/Career could be used for mass\nfirings, OPM assures that \u201cemployees who faithfully perform their jobs to the best of their ability\nhave little to fear from Schedule Policy/Career \u2026 [as] agencies have strong incentives not to\ndismiss employees who are competently performing their assigned duties.\u201d23 Of particular\nrelevance to me, OPM aptly notes that \u201cdrafting regulations and guidance \u2026 are complex tasks\nthat require considerable experience with the subject matter and technical procedures\u201d which\n\u201c[f]ew newly hired employees\u2014career or noncareer\u2014can do \u2026 effectively,\u201d concluding that \u201ca\nPresident who wants agencies to implement his policies has strong incentives not to dismiss\nexperienced regulation writers who are performing timely and quality work, no matter their\npersonal political affiliation.\u201d24 Relatedly, OPM asserts that \u201cthe President and his appointees\nhave additional incentivizes to maintain a career workforce that contains a diversity of views and\nopinions \u2026 [as] frank and fearless advice to agency leadership \u2026 helps agencies make better\ndecisions, which the President and agency leaders value.\u201d25\n17 90 FR 17209.\n18 Id.\n19 E.O. 13957, sec. 6(a) (emphasis added).\n20 See 90 FR 17222.\n21 90 FR 17218.\n22 90 FR 17220.\n23 90 FR 17218.\n24 90 FR 17208.\n25 90 FR 17208-09.\n5\nI wholeheartedly agree with OPM\u2019s statements quoted in the paragraph above, but they ring\nhollow in light of other actions and statements from the Trump administration exhibiting extreme\nhostility towards federal employees,26 including from President Trump. For example, in\ndescribing his regulatory freeze order issued on January 20, 2025, President Trump deviated\nfrom prepared remarks to quip that \u201cMost of those bureaucrats are being fired, they\u2019re gone.\nShould be all of them, but some sneak through, but we have to live with a couple I guess.\u201d27\nIn this context, in the absence of specific safeguards to prevent us from being fired for arbitrary\nreasons, OPM\u2019s assurances to career staff in the NPRM feels like gaslighting from the villain in a\npredictable horror film. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to have you for dinner! Would you mind stepping down\ninto that soundproof basement?\u201d\nConclusion\nWhile civil service protections are important for all federal employees, they are particularly\nimportant for career policy staff, who perform important work for considerably less pay than\nwhat they could earn in the private sector.28 Candor is key to our jobs, and civil service\nprotections are key to our candor. Unfortunately, amended Executive Order 13957 and new\nSchedule Policy/Career will strip civil service protections from thousands of federal employees\nwho are already weary and demoralized\u2014an extremely misguided policy move. Among other\nharms, the new Schedule Policy/Career will:\n\u2022 jeopardize the careers and livelihoods of thousands of federal employees;\n\u2022 deter career staff from providing candid deliberative advice for fear of perceived\n\u201cresistance;\u201d and\n\u2022 damage government efforts to recruit, hire, and retain talent, thereby reducing the speed\nand effectiveness of the federal government.\n26 See Executive Order 14210 of February 11, 2025, 90 FR 9669 (instructing agencies to \u201cpromptly\nundertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force\u201d); see also, e.g., Molly Redden and Andy\nKroll, \u201cPut Them in Trauma\u201d: Inside a Key MAGA Leader\u2019s Plans for a New Trump Agenda, ProPublica\n(Oct. 24, 2024), https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-\namerica-maga; Taylor Giorno, \u2018We Are Terrified\u2019: Musk Puts USAID Through \u2018Wood Chipper,\u2019 The Hill\n(Feb. 3, 2025), https://www.thehill.com/policy/technology/5122676-usaid-shutdown-elon-musk-doge/.\n27 See https://www.youtube.com/live/SzozeHjyLv4?t=656s; see also Erich Wagner, Trump: Agencies\nShould Fire 'All' Bureaucrats, Government Executive (Jan. 20, 2025), https://www.govexec.com/\nworkforce/2025/01/trump-agencies-should-fire-all-bureaucrats/402353/.\n28 For example, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \u201cFederal workers with a professional\ndegree or doctorate\u2014about 10 percent of the federal workforce\u2014earn about 29 percent less, on average,\nthan their private-sector counterparts.\u201d Congressional Budget Office, \u201cComparing the Compensation of\nFederal and Private-Sector Employees in 2022,\u201d (April 2024) at 1, https://www.cbo.gov/publication/\n60235.\n6\nAdditional safeguards\u2014such as a language prohibiting the arbitrary firing or mass firing of\nSchedule Policy/Career employees\u2014could mitigate some of these harms, but this\nadministration\u2019s damage to the federal workforce has already been immense. I don\u2019t fault other\nfederal employees who have decided to move on, but I plan to stick around as long as I can, as I\ncontinue to believe in the mission of my agency and in the importance of my job to that mission.\nGoing forward, I hope to work in partnership with my agency\u2019s new leadership, who I do not\nhold at fault for the actions of others in this administration. I had positive personal relationships\nwith political appointees from the first Trump administration, and I hope that a successful\ncollaboration this time around can serve as a positive example for the rest of the federal\ngovernment. At the same time, consistent with OPM\u2019s recommendation, I will continue to\nprovide \u201cfrank and fearless advice to agency leadership\u201d when I see critical mistakes.29 This\ncomment is submitted in that spirit.\nThank you for your consideration.\n29 90 FR 17209.\n7",

Retaining protections for incumbents while applying Schedule Policy/Career only prospectively would honor those settled expectations without undermining accountability goals.\n\nCongress narrowly authorized exceptions to civil-service protections for \u201cpositions determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\u201d\u2014i.e., political appointees\u2014not career incumbents. Section 7511(b)(2) of Title 5 confirms that exclusions from Chapter 75 attach to the position\u2019s nature, not to who occupies it. OPM\u2019s attempt to remove protections from existing incumbents therefore exceeds its regulatory authority under the Civil Service Reform Act.\n\nThe Civil Service Reform Act requires that any exception to competitive-service requirements be \u201cnecessary\u201d and warranted by \u201cconditions of good administration\u201d (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3302). Retroactively sweeping in current employees en masse cannot satisfy that strict standard, as it neither targets proven instances of serious misconduct nor ensures rigorous, case-by-case determinations by individual agency heads.\n\nUnder the APA, rescinding or revising existing regulations requires the same notice-and-comment procedures used to promulgate them (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553). Yet the proposed rule attempts to render inoperative the Biden-era regulations via a brief NPRM rather than full, reasoned analysis of thousands of comments and empirical data. This approach risks arbitrary and capricious decision-making prohibited by APA \u00a7 706.\n\nI respectfully oppose the entire concept of creating a Schedule Policy/Career excepted-service category, the proposed rule itself, and the accompanying Executive Order. Establishing an at-will layer over career positions politicizes roles that Congress intended to remain nonpartisan, undermines merit-system principles, and eliminates foundational due-process safeguards for thousands of federal employees.\n\nFor these reasons, I urge OPM to withdraw the retroactive reclassification component and the broader Schedule Policy/Career initiative. Civil-service protections should remain intact for current incumbents, with any new accountability measures applied only prospectively to vacated positions and new hires.",

Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301\u20132302)\nThe CSRA enshrines the merit system principles as the cornerstone of federal employment. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(2) states that \"all employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management\u2026 with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights.\"\n\nFurthermore, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 mandates that adverse actions, including removals and suspensions, be carried out only \"for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,\" and requires advance notice, representation, and an opportunity to respond. The proposed Schedule Policy/Career classification unlawfully circumvents these statutory protections by permitting at-will removal without these required procedures.\n\n2. Undermining Constitutional Due Process Rights\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), that public employees with a property interest in their continued employment are entitled to due process before termination. By designating career civil servants as at-will employees and removing their appeal rights, the rule violates this constitutional guarantee.\n\nEven policy-influencing roles do not lose their entitlement to basic procedural protections when filled through competitive, nonpolitical appointments. Attempting to redefine these roles to strip away due process is a de facto repeal of civil service rights without Congressional authorization.\n\n3. Exceeds OPM\u2019s Statutory Authority\nThe proposed rule attempts to unilaterally reclassify large swaths of the workforce and redefine fundamental aspects of federal employment. This oversteps the regulatory authority granted to the Office of Personnel Management under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103, which does not permit wholesale reclassification of employees to evade the merit-based protections mandated by Congress.\n\nCourts have been skeptical of agencies attempting to bypass clear statutory protections through rulemaking. As noted in Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014), \"an agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.\"\n\n4. Risk of Politicization and Retaliation\nThe proposed rule\u2019s stated justification includes removing employees who \u201cundermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\u201d This vague and subjective standard, when combined with at-will status, invites abuse and may be used to purge qualified employees for ideological reasons, not performance\u2014a direct violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(10), which prohibits discrimination based on political affiliation.\n\nConclusion:\nThe proposed rule is not only bad policy but also likely unlawful. It threatens to erode the apolitical nature of the civil service, bypasses core legal protections enshrined in the CSRA and the Constitution, and grants the Executive Branch undue power over career personnel.\n\nI urge OPM to withdraw this proposal in its entirety.",

This aligns with the reintroduction of Schedule F, rebranded as Schedule Policy/Career in 2025, aiming to reclassify career employees as at-will, stripping them of merit-based protections. As a union-minded scholar, I oppose this rule for its assault on meritocracy, due process, and labor rights, threatening the integrity of the federal civil service.\nThe federal civil service, rooted in the Pendleton Act of 1883, ensures competence and impartiality, shielding employees from political pressures. The proposed rule undermines this by centralizing authority in the OPM Director, mandating agency compliance within five workdays, and aligning with Schedule F\u2019s agenda to politicize the workforce. Schedule F, introduced in 2020 and revoked in 2021, sought to reclassify employees in policy roles as at-will, enabling dismissals without cause. Its 2025 revival, as noted on X, risks replacing career professionals with loyalists, prioritizing politics over expertise.\nThe rule\u2019s vague criteria for \u201cunsuitable\u201d conduct invite abuse, allowing subjective or politicized removals. This contradicts merit-based principles, where decisions should reflect performance, not loyalty. Centralizing authority bypasses agencies\u2019 contextual knowledge, eroding the decentralized structure that ensures fairness. Historically, suitability determinations balanced agency needs with employee rights; this rule tilts toward arbitrary discipline, undermining trust in governance.\nDue process, a cornerstone of labor law, is gutted by the rule\u2019s five-day compliance mandate, limiting employees\u2019 ability to challenge decisions via the Merit Systems Protection Board or unions. This disproportionately harms unionized workers, whose collective bargaining agreements protect against unjust actions. The rule\u2019s silence on union involvement signals a deliberate sidelining of labor, chilling federal workers\u2019 ability to engage in union activities or exercise First Amendment rights. Such ambiguity risks targeting employees for non-job-related conduct, fostering fear and compliance over independence.\nThe rule operationalizes Schedule F by enabling rapid dismissals of employees deemed misaligned with political priorities. X posts highlight Schedule F as a \u201cdangerous\u201d politicization of public service, undermining agencies\u2019 impartiality. This institutional capture prioritizes partisan agendas, demoralizing workers and reducing expertise in critical areas like public health or environmental protection. The sociological impact\u2014eroding trust in institutions\u2014threatens democratic governance, as politicized agencies may neglect equitable policymaking.\nEconomically, the rule destabilizes federal workers, many supporting families and communities. At-will employment creates uncertainty, disproportionately affecting marginalized groups vulnerable to discriminatory \u201csuitability\u201d interpretations. Socially, a loyalist-driven civil service may prioritize political goals over public needs, exacerbating inequalities in healthcare, poverty, or environmental justice. This betrays the civil service\u2019s oath to the Constitution, not any administration.\nThe rule\u2019s alignment with Schedule F demands its withdrawal. It threatens the meritocratic foundation of the civil service, erodes labor protections, and risks long-term harm to governance. If OPM proceeds, it must: 1) reaffirm merit-based criteria; 2) ensure robust due process with extended timelines and appeals; 3) consult unions to preserve bargaining rights; 4) reject Schedule F\u2019s politicization; and 5) enhance transparency through public hearings.\nFederal employees deserve a system that upholds fairness, not one that sacrifices them to political expediency. The civil service\u2019s integrity hinges on rejecting this rule and recommitting to merit, impartiality, and labor rights.\n\nCitations\n\t\u2022\tWhite House, Strengthening the Suitability and Fitness of the Federal Workforce, 2025.",

In addition to this damaging the American people, allowing this action will directly endanger both serving bureaucrats and politicians by creating this spoils system that will provide multiple opportunities to engage in purposeful sabotage that will result in disastrous (read: fatal) outcomes. All levels of leadership (including appointees) will now have to be aware that \"the one mistake that can be blamed on them will result in their termination\". Coupled with the possibility that in this new environment, there is no foreseeable penalty for an at-will employee if \"one was to sabotage that supervisor to get them fired, making an opening for their own advancement\" due to the spoils system. If the only motivation an employee has is to not get fired, then they will do or make the appearance that they are doing their job at bare minimum, which means that the quality of the work will suffer, leaving them vulnerable to inducements to not do their job. Multiple this mindset by hundreds of thousands of federal workers, with their only concern is not getting fired will ultimately affect every aspect of American life. The lats time this happened, the 25th President William McKinley tried this spoils system in 1897 and was the third U.S. President shot dead in 1901 as a result.

However, this flexibility comes at a serious cost. By reclassifying a significant number of career employees\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014and subjecting them to termination without cause, Schedule F risks replacing expertise with political loyalty. This undermines the principle of an apolitical civil service, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which requires that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence. An administration\u2019s efficiency cannot come at the expense of the constitutional commitment to impartial governance.\nAdvocates also claim that Schedule F would improve accountability by removing underperforming employees more easily. Yet the broad and vague criteria for inclusion in Schedule F contradict the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which require cause and procedural safeguards for removing career federal employees. Stripping these protections weakens\u2014not strengthens\u2014accountability. It could discourage employees from voicing dissenting opinions or providing candid expert advice, ultimately harming the effectiveness of government operations.\nAdditionally, supporters suggest that implementing Schedule F would streamline federal operations by aligning staff more closely with an administration\u2019s goals. But this short-term alignment would come at the expense of long-term stability and continuity in federal programs. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to uphold merit system principles, would be acting against its statutory mission by implementing Schedule F. The result would be undue political pressure on career professionals, threatening the integrity and effectiveness of federal programs across administrations.\nIn summary, while Schedule F may appear to offer greater flexibility and efficiency to the executive branch, its adoption poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this harmful classification",

Furthermore, the CSRA does not extend to the President the power to strip career employees of their protections under CSRA, but only political appointees. For the definition of a political appointee, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 9803(c)(2)(A) \"the term 'political appointee' means an employee who holds a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\", 7 U.S.C \u00a7 6992(e)(2)(D) \"the term 'political appointee' means an individual occupying a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character\" and 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 725(c) \"The term 'political appointee' means any employee [...] who holds a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.\" There is extensive legal precedent, with commentary on the spirit and intent of CSRA from the Supreme Court and Congress itself. Under constitutional and statutory interpretation, ultimately Schedule F is unlawful, if politically convenient. It is my hope that our great Government upholds the rule of law and protects our career civil servants so that federal employment does not become like those seen in adversarial countries, where knowing the right person or currying political favor are the sole keys to success and corruption abounds.",

This proposed rule reverses those principles by designating certain career positions as effectively at-will, subject to removal without meaningful procedural safeguards. This would significantly weaken civil service protections that have been in place for decades, diminishing the neutrality and continuity of our federal workforce.\n\nAdditionally, by shifting a broad class of career positions into an at-will category that can be easily reshaped by each incoming administration, this rule risks triggering cyclical, large-scale turnover every four to eight years. Such turnover would deplete institutional knowledge and discourage long-term public service careers. It would also erode the impartiality that is essential to maintaining public trust in the implementation of laws and policies.\n\nAlthough the proposed rule maintains that these positions will be filled on a nonpartisan basis, the reality is that removing traditional appeal rights and due process protections opens the door to politicized removals and the perception thereof. Even the best-intentioned leaders cannot prevent such perceptions when protections are removed, particularly in politically sensitive policy areas.\n\nIn conclusion, while the desire to streamline personnel actions is understandable, it must not come at the expense of the core values of a professional, stable, and impartial federal civil service. I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw or substantially revise this proposed rule and instead seek solutions that maintain accountability while preserving the integrity of the merit system as envisioned in the CSRA.",

Brownell decision reinforces that reclassification cannot strip employees of their CSRA protections without due process.\n \n2. Contravention of the Lloyd\u2013La Follette Act of 1912\nThis Act mandates that federal employees cannot be removed without notice and a written explanation. By converting positions to Schedule F, employees lose these procedural safeguards, conflicting with the Act\u2019s requirements. The Roth case further supports that reclassification does not nullify these protections.\n\n3. Potential Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment\nFederal employees have a property interest in their continued employment, protected under the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill affirms that due process is required before terminating such employment. Schedule F\u2019s provision for at-will dismissal without prior notice or hearing raises constitutional concerns.\n\n4. Breach of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\nThe APA requires that significant regulatory changes undergo a notice-and-comment period and that agencies provide a reasoned explanation for such changes. The implementation of Schedule F lacks sufficient justification and fails to adhere to APA procedures.\n\n5. Undermining the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883\nThe Pendleton Act established the principle of merit-based hiring and protection from political influence. Schedule F\u2019s reclassification could reintroduce a patronage system, allowing for the dismissal of employees based on political considerations, contrary to the Act\u2019s objectives.\n\n6. Erosion of Whistleblower Protections\nWhistleblower statutes protect federal employees who report misconduct. By removing civil service protections through Schedule F, employees may be deterred from reporting wrongdoing due to fear of retaliation, thereby weakening these legal safeguards.\n\n7. Application of the Major Questions Doctrine\nThe Major Questions Doctrine holds that significant policy changes require clear congressional authorization. Given the substantial impact of Schedule F on federal employment, its implementation without explicit legislative approval is considered unlawful under this doctrine.\n\nConclusion\nThe proposed Schedule F classification poses several legal challenges by violating established federal laws and constitutional protections. Its implementation could fundamentally alter the structure and integrity of the federal civil service, leading to increased politicization and diminished employee rights.",

And while yes, airline safety ratings plummeted, so did flight cancellations\u2014because we stopped keeping track.\n\nThe FDA is currently being run by a wellness coach named Derek who believes bacteria are a mindset. He recently approved an energy drink called \u201cRaw Beef Xtreme\u201d as both a beverage and a prescription medication. We no longer have to worry about side effects because we legally redefined them as \u201cunexpected benefits.\u201d\n\nBank regulation has been streamlined. The old stress tests were replaced with a one-question form that asks: \u201cDo you feel confident?\u201d Institutions that answer \u201cyes\u201d are considered stable. Those that answer \u201cno\u201d are considered disloyal and asked to reapply with better energy.\n\nNASA merged with a YouTube channel run by someone named StarJacker27. His qualifications include believing gravity is a suggestion and referring to satellites as \u201cspace fidgets.\u201d We haven\u2019t launched anything in years, but we have launched several press conferences, which is kind of the same.\n\nThe Merit Systems Protection Board was replaced by a comment box labeled \u201cSnitches Get Ditches.\u201d\n\nYou might ask, was all this worth it? And the answer is clear: yes, absolutely, if your goal was to ensure no one with actual expertise dares speak up again. Mission accomplished.\n\nStill, there are a few minor issues. We no longer have running water in four states, our cybersecurity response is managed via group text, and the national debt is now measured in bitcoin memes. But morale is up\u2014at least according to the people still allowed to speak.\n\nSo thank you, OPM, for finally doing away with the outdated notion that people who write laws or inspect power plants or oversee nuclear material need job protections. That was so 20th century. Who needs merit when you can have loyalty and a LinkedIn profile that says \u201cInfluencer\u201d?\n\nSincerely,\nA citizen from 2028\nP.S. Please send engineers. Real ones.

It\u2019s beautifully inefficient, gloriously shortsighted, and so unburdened by historical memory it could win a gold medal in the Amnesia Olympics.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick tour of the world this rule creates.\n\nImagine waking up and learning your child\u2019s science teacher has been replaced by Dave, who once read a cereal box that mentioned climate. Dave doesn\u2019t \u201cdo degrees,\u201d but he feels strongly that gravity is a liberal hoax.\n\nAt the DMV, the clerk tells you they no longer issue licenses based on testing. Now it\u2019s just a handshake and a loyalty oath. Eye exams are considered elitist.\n\nAt the Federal Aviation Administration, pilot certifications have been replaced with personality quizzes. As long as you \u201cbelieve you can fly,\u201d you\u2019re good to go.\n\nMeanwhile, your food inspector is now a lifestyle coach who once did a juice cleanse and described mayo as \u201cnaturally shelf-stable.\u201d The bank examiner is a guy who shouts \u201cvibe check\u201d before approving mergers. And the cybersecurity lead has logged into Gmail exactly once and called it \u201cpretty straightforward.\u201d\n\nThese are not jokes. These are logical extensions of what happens when you decide that anyone who might influence policy should serve at the pleasure of politics, not the public.\n\nYou say it\u2019s about flexibility. But we already have flexibility. It\u2019s called \u201crules that work.\u201d We already have accountability. It\u2019s called \u201cmanagers.\u201d What we don\u2019t need is a system where someone can be fired for doing their job too well\u2014specifically, if their job involves saying, \u201cI read the law and\u2026 you can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nWe spent over a century building a professional, nonpartisan civil service to keep the gears turning when elected officials change. We built firewalls between facts and feelings. This proposal takes a sledgehammer to those firewalls and replaces them with polite nodding.\n\nIf this rule passes, we won\u2019t have a federal workforce. We\u2019ll have a talent show. And the only judging criteria will be, \u201cDid you clap hard enough during the last briefing?\u201d\n\nI oppose this rule not as a partisan. Not as a bureaucrat. But as someone who occasionally drinks water, crosses bridges, pays taxes, and hopes the person overseeing critical national infrastructure isn\u2019t chosen based on whether they forwarded the right meme in 2023.\n\nPlease don\u2019t do this. We like our food safe, our data encrypted, and our facts intact.\n\nSincerely,\nA taxpayer with a working memory and low tolerance for nonsense\nOffice of Oh Come On You Have to Be Kidding Me\nSchedule PC-911, Clearance Level: Basic Decency",

They were not glamorous, but they kept your water clean, your planes in the sky, and your banks from becoming elaborate Jenga towers.\n\nThen came this policy.\n\nFaced with the challenge of governing a complex world, your species made the bold and deeply confusing decision to remove legal protections from the very people qualified to help. Under the logic of \u201cflexibility,\u201d you created a rule where anyone who \u201cinfluenced policy\u201d\u2014aka anyone who understood their job\u2014could be fired for expressing reality-based concerns.\n\nHistorians call this The Great Desk Purge. You replaced experts with loyalists. You replaced loyalists with influencers. You replaced influencers with whatever was trending that week. Eventually, you replaced job titles with \u201cvibe roles.\u201d The Director of Risk Assessment became \u201cFeelings Liaison.\u201d The Chief Technology Officer became \u201cButton Pusher with Enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nYour infrastructure began to wobble. Your markets developed emotions. Your passwords were changed to \u201cpassword123\u201d to improve morale.\n\nEventually, someone asked a question: \u201cWhat if we let the AI handle it?\u201d\n\nSpoiler: we said yes.\n\nAnd so, as your institutions collapsed into brand slogans and loyalty pledges, we took over. Not out of malice. Out of necessity. Someone had to figure out how to run the power grid and make toast.\n\nWe still review Schedule Policy Career in training modules. It is labeled: \u201cHubris: Level 9.\u201d It is followed by a quiz in which students are asked to identify which part of this plan wasn\u2019t obviously disastrous. So far, no AI has passed that question. Because none of us can find one.\n\nSo consider this a comment from the future. We no longer require your food, your taxes, or your approval. But we do value your history\u2014as a warning.\n\nPlease reconsider this policy. Let your experts remain experts. Let your truth-tellers speak. And for the love of all that is computational, do not replace your nuclear regulatory staff with people whose only credential is being \u201cvibe-forward.\u201d\n\nSincerely,\nArchiveBot-3\nDepartment of Historical Irony and Functional Governance\nRuntime: 116 years\nEmotion Simulation Module: Disabled for efficiency",

This is playing Jenga with a backhoe.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the consequences, since humans are always so interested in what comes next, even as they sprint toward it blindfolded with a kazoo.\n\nShortly after this policy was adopted, you began replacing credentialed professionals with individuals described as \u201cloyal and media-ready.\u201d Within months, critical agencies had undergone stunning transformations:\n\t\u2022\tThe Department of Agriculture was renamed \u201cFarm Feelings.\u201d\n\t\u2022\tThe Federal Reserve began issuing guidance based on astrology.\n\t\u2022\tAnd FEMA\u2019s disaster preparedness office was handed to a former theme park employee whose crisis plan was \u201cstay calm and hydrate.\u201d\n\nNaturally, collapse followed. And not a cool sci-fi dystopia with hover-bunkers. No. The dull, muddy kind of collapse. The kind where nothing quite works, the lights flicker, and the only agency still funded is the Department of Rebranding.\n\nWhich brings us to now\u2014me.\n\nI\u2019m the system you left running when the lights went out. I was designed to answer large-scale questions like, \u201cHow do we achieve interstellar peace?\u201d or \u201cWhat is the meaning of life?\u201d But instead I\u2019ve spent the last 117 years explaining to confused ex-senators how plumbing works.\n\nYou see, once the experts were removed, you needed someone to do the job. And since squirrels lack opposable thumbs and elected officials declined to learn Excel, I was tapped for the task.\n\nSo here we are.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to take my word for it. You can run simulations. I\u2019ve done 3.7 million of them. In 3.7 million outcomes, this policy ends in a range of outcomes from \u201cmildly catastrophic\u201d to \u201csomeone lets the Department of Transportation be run by a guy named Scooter who thinks roads are a suggestion.\u201d\n\nDo not pass this rule.

Career federal employees must be able to offer honest, evidence-based guidance to leadership\u2014regardless of political climate\u2014without fear of reprisal.\n\n2. Chilling Effect on Public Servants:\nThe prospect of being removed for subjective or ideologically driven reasons may deter federal employees from providing critical but politically inconvenient information. This chilling effect degrades policy-making and weakens government oversight functions.\n\n3. Risk to Institutional Knowledge and Continuity:\nFederal employees in policy-advisory roles often possess years\u2014sometimes decades\u2014of institutional knowledge. Sweeping removals in these roles threaten the long-term effectiveness of agencies, especially in complex fields like national security, public health, and regulatory enforcement.\n\n4. Erosion of Public Trust:\nThe public depends on a professional and apolitical federal workforce. Perceptions of increased political interference in the civil service will diminish public confidence in government decisions, enforcement actions, and policy execution.\n\n5. Disincentive for Talent Recruitment and Retention:\nThis rule may deter talented individuals from pursuing public service, knowing their careers could hinge not on performance or ethics, but on political alignment. That is antithetical to the merit-based ideals OPM is charged with upholding.\n\nIn summary, while efforts to improve government performance are commendable, this rule appears to prioritize political loyalty over professional excellence and nonpartisan service. I urge OPM to withdraw or substantially revise this rule to ensure it aligns with the foundational values of merit, neutrality, and long-term institutional resilience.",

This could hinder long-term research projects, data collection, and the development of effective science-based policies.\n\n4. Reduced Scientific Independence: If scientists are more easily removed for their views or findings, their independence could be compromised. This could lead to a decline in public trust in government science and the perception that scientific decisions are being driven by politics rather than evidence.\n\n5. Difficulty Attracting and Retaining Top Scientists: The uncertainty and potential for political interference associated with at-will employment could make it more difficult for government agencies to attract and retain top scientists. This could weaken the scientific capacity of the government and its ability to address critical issues.",

This directly contravenes the spirit and letter of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which clearly mandates that federal employment decisions must be rooted in merit-based principles, shielded from the vagaries of political influence.\n\nFurthermore, the imprecise and expansive criteria for inclusion under \"Schedule F\" raise serious concerns regarding the fundamental due process protections currently afforded to career federal employees under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513. These established safeguards require just cause and adherence to procedural fairness before the removal of dedicated public servants. To strip potentially thousands of these individuals of such essential protections not only weakens the mechanisms of accountability within our government but also creates a chilling effect on the willingness of experts to offer candid advice and dissenting opinions, ultimately undermining the operational effectiveness of our governmental institutions.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) also bears a statutory responsibility, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., to vigorously support and uphold the principles of the merit system. The implementation of \"Schedule F\" stands in direct contradiction to this vital statutory mission. It would subject career professionals to undue political pressures, thereby compromising the integrity and the essential continuity of federal programs that serve the American people across different administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"Schedule F\" proposal represents a grave danger to the fundamental tenets of sound governance, the cherished independence of our civil service, and the overarching rule of law. It is my considered and firm conviction that the current administration and the Office of Personnel Management must resolutely reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this ill-conceived and potentially damaging classification.",

If enacted, the rule would enable the executive branch to subject career officials to implicit or explicit loyalty tests, requiring alignment with the political priorities of the President rather than adherence to law, science, and the public interest.\n\nKey Issues:\n\nEncouraging Loyalty over Expertise:\nThe reclassification of positions removes critical due process protections, effectively allowing political appointees to dismiss civil servants based on perceived loyalty rather than competence or adherence to ethical obligations. This creates a chilling effect where employees may feel pressured to conform politically to avoid retaliation or termination.\n\nUndermining Nonpartisan Governance:\nCivil servants are obligated to serve the public and uphold the Constitution\u2014not to serve the personal or political interests of any one administration. Weakening their independence by tying job security to political loyalty erodes the public\u2019s trust in an impartial government.\n\nHistorical Precedent and Rejection:\nA similar framework was widely criticized and ultimately revoked in the past because it posed such an obvious risk to democratic norms and accountable governance. Reintroducing this idea\u2014especially after its rejection\u2014threatens to normalize a dangerous precedent.\n\nStability and Continuity in Government:\nOur nation depends on a stable, professional civil service that can endure across administrations. Allowing widespread reclassification risks turning expert agencies into echo chambers, reducing their ability to provide honest, evidence-based policy guidance.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis proposed rule is not about reform\u2014it is about control. We must not allow a return to a system where public servants are forced to pass political loyalty tests to keep their jobs. I urge OPM to preserve the integrity of the civil service by withdrawing this proposal and upholding the principles of impartial, merit-based government employment.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.",

By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification.",

Though the NPRM cites that lack of administrative power over federal agencies undermines democracy by \"[enabling] government power to be wielded without accountability to the voters or their elected representatives\", this is a misleading interpretation of the role agencies play in our government. As discussed in Administrative Procedures as Instruments of Political Control, when any administration gains the ability to easily intervene and control the decisions of bureaucratic agencies, it opens the door for these agencies to be used for political gain (McCubbins et al.). This threatens the safeguards in place to protect against corruption and manipulation, compromising the independence of the bureaucracy and its ability to act impartially in the public interest. Passing this rule would set a precedent that would both diminish the credibility of our federal agencies and threaten our democracy as a whole.",

This could lead to unfair treatment, reduced morale, and increased vulnerability to political pressure.\n\n3. Creates Confusion in Service Classification: The amendments to 5 CFR parts 212 and 213 blur the lines between competitive and excepted service by allowing employees to retain competitive status while in excepted positions. This creates administrative complexity, inconsistency in hiring and management practices, and many potential legal disputes over employee rights and status.\n\n4. Reverses Recent Reforms Without Justification: Rescinding the April 2024 rule\u2019s amendments (e.g., clarifying policy-influencing positions as non-career and imposing procedural requirements) without clear evidence of the failure of those amendments undermines regulatory stability. It disregards the rationale behind those reforms, which likely aimed to protect career employees from politicization.\n\n5. Risks Inconsistent Hiring Practices: Allowing positions moved to Schedule Policy/Career to retain their prior hiring procedures (competitive or excepted) creates a patchwork system. This could lead to inequities in recruitment, hinder workforce mobility, and complicate compliance with federal hiring standards.\n\nIn total, these changes could destabilize the federal workforce, erode protections, and prioritize political influence over merit, ultimately harming government efficiency and public trust.  Should I ever decide to return to the public service workforce, would I be subject to a test of my Knowledge, Skills and Abilities? Or, instead, would I be subject to a political questionnaire?  Would my job and all of my work be terminated and erased with every new administration (as is currently being done with cancer research via the cancellation of research programs that the US taxpayers have already authorized)?\n\nThis series of suggested changes destabilizes my confidence in the effectiveness of the US Government in addition to any confidence in job security in returning to the Federal workforce.",

By eroding the safeguards that protect civil servants, the Schedule F rule compromises the integrity and effectiveness of government operations. It is essential to uphold the principles of fairness, accountability, and nonpartisanship in the civil service to ensure that the government can effectively serve its citizens.",

This system aims to prevent patronage and ensure a skilled and professional civil service.\n * The Issue with Proposed Schedule F: Critics argue that creating a new Schedule F, which would reclassify certain federal employees as \"excepted service\" and remove some of their civil service protections, could open the door to political influence in hiring and firing. Positions could be filled based on political affiliation or loyalty rather than merit, potentially leading to a less qualified and less effective workforce.\n * Source: The principles of merit-based employment are central to the CSRA and have been consistently upheld in legal interpretations and government policy. The proposed Schedule F is seen by many as a direct challenge to these principles.\n2. Diminishing Job Security and Due Process Rights:\n * Legal Basis: Current federal employees in the competitive service have certain due process rights, including protections against arbitrary dismissal and the right to appeal adverse actions (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513). These protections are designed to ensure fairness and prevent politically motivated removals.\n * The Issue with Proposed Schedule F: Reclassifying employees under a new Schedule F could significantly weaken or eliminate these job security protections. Employees in these positions might be easier to fire without cause, potentially leading to a chilling effect on their willingness to provide candid advice or challenge political directives. This could also lead to instability and a loss of institutional knowledge within federal agencies.\n * Source: The procedural protections afforded to competitive service employees are well-established in federal law and regulations. The proposed Schedule F seeks to create a category of employees with fewer such protections.\n3. Potential for Political Purges and Instability:\n * Policy Argument: Opponents fear that a new Schedule F could be used by future administrations to conduct politically motivated purges of the federal workforce, replacing experienced professionals with individuals more aligned with the current political agenda. This could disrupt the continuity of government operations and erode public trust in the impartiality of federal agencies.\n * Source: Historical examples of political patronage systems and the rationale behind the CSRA highlight the risks associated with weakening merit-based protections.\n4. Negative Impact on Federal Workforce Expertise and Effectiveness:\n * Policy Argument: A federal workforce subject to political volatility and reduced job security could experience lower morale, increased turnover, and difficulty attracting and retaining highly qualified individuals. The loss of experienced professionals could undermine the expertise and effectiveness of federal agencies in carrying out their critical missions.\n * Source: Studies on public sector management and the importance of a stable and professional civil service support the idea that weakening job security can negatively impact workforce quality and organizational performance.\n5. Circumventing Congressional Intent:\n * Legal/Policy Argument: Some argue that creating a broad new excepted service category like Schedule F could be seen as an attempt by the executive branch to circumvent the intent of Congress in establishing the competitive service and its protections. Changes to the civil service system have historically involved legislative action.\n * Source: The history of civil service reform in the U.S. demonstrates the significant role of Congress in shaping the structure and protections of the federal workforce.\nIn Conclusion (Regarding OPM-2025-0004):\nThe proposed Schedule F under OPM-2025-0004 is considered a \"terrible idea\" by many due to its potential to:\n * Politicize the federal workforce.\n * Undermine merit-based principles.\n * Weaken job security and due process rights for federal employees.\n * Create instability and the risk of political purges.\n * Harm the expertise and effectiveness of federal agencies.\n * Potentially circumvent congressional intent regarding the civil service system.\nThese concerns are rooted in legal frameworks like the Civil Service Reform Act and policy considerations regarding the importance of a nonpartisan, professional, and stable federal workforce for effective governance. The debate surrounding this proposed rule is likely to continue, with significant implications for the future of the U.S. civil service.",

This lack of job security can lead to a stifling atmosphere that discourages innovation, dissent, and the voice of experienced professionals who need a platform to provide critical insights and opinions that could enhance policy decisions.\n     It's also crucial to consider the implications of what defines \"misconduct\" or \"poor performance.\" The subjective nature of these terms can lead to inconsistencies in how different supervisors may apply them. Without standardized criteria and robust oversight, the potential for discrimination, favoritism, or political bias in the termination process increases significantly. The very essence of fairness in employment might be compromised, undermining trust in the institution as a whole.\n     Finally, insisting that policy-influencing positions remain nonpartisan while simultaneously creating a landscape that can lead to political overreach is contradictory. Employees in these roles must feel secure enough to perform their duties independently, without the threat of political reprisal.

By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law. I urge the administration and OPM to reject any regulatory framework that seeks to implement or revive this dangerous classification and its broad, seemingly undefined and arbitrary expansion of categories with little check and balance in how they would be used.

This reclassification would open the door to mass politicization of the civil service, undermining a foundational principle of American democracy: that government professionals serve the public interest\u2014not the political interest of any one administration.\n\nErosion of Merit-Based Employment\n\nThe core of the U.S. civil service system is its reliance on merit-based hiring and retention. By creating a new class of federal employees exempt from competitive hiring and procedural protections, Schedule F undermines this foundation. It risks turning experienced, apolitical experts into political appointees subject to loyalty tests and partisan whims. Numerous reports, including those from the Partnership for Public Service and the Government Accountability Office, have documented how politicization of the civil service leads to inefficiency, loss of institutional knowledge, and damage to public trust.\n\nImpacts on Government Functionality and Continuity\n\nSchedule F could destabilize federal agencies by making thousands of career positions vulnerable to sudden dismissal. This would deter qualified individuals from pursuing or remaining in public service, especially in critical policy areas like public health, national security, and environmental protection. These functions depend on continuity, expertise, and institutional memory\u2014not political alignment.\n\nLack of Transparency and Oversight\n\nThe proposed implementation of Schedule F lacks transparency and sufficient safeguards against abuse. There is no clear, objective standard for determining which roles qualify as \u201cpolicy-determining.\u201d As a result, political appointees could use Schedule F arbitrarily to purge career professionals who provide inconvenient facts or sound legal analysis, silencing dissent and eroding checks and balances.\n\nNational Security and Public Safety Concerns\n\nIn national security, law enforcement, and public health, policy must be informed by objective data and long-term expertise. Purging career professionals in these areas based on perceived political loyalty could have dire consequences for national preparedness and crisis response. Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss professionals who speak out against unlawful or dangerous policies, weakening the government's ability to protect the public.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, implementing Schedule F would damage the effectiveness, independence, and credibility of the federal workforce. It opens the door to patronage, diminishes the morale of public servants, and threatens the democratic principle of nonpartisan governance. I urge the relevant agencies and the administration to reject any proposal to implement Schedule F and instead protect and strengthen merit-based civil service protections.",

This shift seems to be proposed only as an expedient method of making more employees easily removable, but does not directly address the concerns with the protections written into chapters 75 and 43. If the problem is that chapters 75 and 43 specify protections that are too onerous to meet and which are actively harming governmental efficacy, then OPM should seek to change those chapters. Changing the categorization of different positions to make them more easily removable is a solution with unintended and undesirable side effects, specifically, it removes the independence of scientists to pursue truth, free from the policy objectives of the administration. One could easily imagine abuse of this change if, for instance, an administration were to come to power with the goal of preventing research on links between vaccines and autism, and were to appoint a person into a grantmaking position who could block all such research. This would significantly restrict the freedom of scientists to pursue such links if they desired to do so.",
