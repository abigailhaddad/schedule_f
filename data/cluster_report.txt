   Title: Comment from Leonard  Kahl
   Key Quote: "Schedule F seems a reasonable way of going, and if not, change it back in time."
   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the implementation of Schedule F, arguing that it is necessary for accountability and oversight of federal employees. The author expresses a belief that the current civil service system is outdated and abused, which aligns with the rule's goals.
   Link: https://www.regulations.gov/comment/OPM-2025-0004-0356
   Full Text: This is very interesting. Every comment I browsed, maybe 20+, was against this regulation. And every comment except one, played the anti Trump, DOGE and Musk cards. This, alone, makes me think that Schedule F implementation is necessary. Something’s amiss here. If, as a Federal Government employee, you are immune to criticism, performance review, essentially any sort of oversight regarding your job, then of course you will be against Schedule F. What is wrong with justification of your salary an...

   Title: Comment from Anonymous
   Key Quote: "This proposed rule provides the opportunity for greater accountability in the federal workforce and acknowledges the fundamental truths of the executive branch."
   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the proposed rule by arguing it enhances accountability and merit in the federal workforce, while also defending the constitutional role of the Executive. The emphasis on removing underperforming employees aligns with the rule's goals.
   Link: https://www.regulations.gov/comment/OPM-2025-0004-1032
   Full Text: Federal workers have repeatedly expressed their frustration with the current administration, but they have not done the honorable thing - they have not resigned. If they truly believe that the work they are being asked to do is so unconstitutional, so despicable, then why do they refuse to leave? Why stay, except to undermine the democratically elected President of the United States, to actively harm the agenda voted in by the American people? Federal workers don't get to systemically erode thei...

   Full Text: The agencies have several different layers of management creating extra levels of bureaucracy. Requesting to allow the "worker" staff to have an opportunity to rate their supervisors. 
In the technical fields, there are subject matter experts that have their voices silenced. The management is making decisions without taking into consideration the history and concerns of technical voices that are very concerned about patient care.

   LLM Rationale: The comment expresses a desire for efficiency in the review process but does not explicitly support or oppose the proposed rule. It focuses on procedural improvements rather than the implications of the rule itself.
   Link: https://www.regulations.gov/comment/OPM-2025-0004-11137
   Full Text: It's laudable that performance matters are taken seriously.  I also appreciate that adverse actions must occasionally be reviewed and defended.  I do not see anything here that improves the process so that the appeal and decision can occur more efficiently.  I strongly prefer a solution that expedites the review process to one that sweeps it aside.

   Full Text: This healthcare oversight office (CMS/CLIA) has grown quite complex over time. Right now, it's set up with one person in charge and five separate teams. Each team has its own manager and advisor, plus 10-14 staff members for each team. These teams handle different tasks like budget, working with states, creating rules, enforcing those rules, and conducting inspections.
The current setup has a lot of overlap, with multiple high-ranking positions doing similar work. Some of this work can be perfor...

   Key Quote: "This rule is a good idea, and OPM should finalize it. I hate it that we have so many Feds who don't pull their weight that stick around forever and drag down the performance of the whole agency."
   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the proposed rule, arguing for accountability in federal employment and suggesting that current civil service protections hinder the ability to remove underperforming employees.
   Link: https://www.regulations.gov/comment/OPM-2025-0004-12005
   Full Text: I am a Fed and I support this rule. As Federal employees we answer to the American people, and that means we have to report to the President and his agency heads. The current system makes it almost impossible to fire tenured Feds, and that is a problem if America is supposed to be a democracy with government by consent of the governed. There has to be accountability if someone is bad at their jobs. Right now there is very little.

   Key Quote: "Maybe we should start at the top and look at all the people making the decisions and red tape that affects the lower employees."
   LLM Rationale: The comment expresses a general concern about leadership and decision-making but does not explicitly support or oppose the proposed rule regarding Schedule F. It lacks specific references to civil service protections or the politicization of the civil service.
   Link: https://www.regulations.gov/comment/OPM-2025-0004-12411
   Full Text: Maybe we should start at the top and look at all the people making the decisions and red tape that affects the lower employees.  Always solve a problem at its source and the source is in laws and the poorly appointed “leaders”. Everyone should worry about themselves and not about others.  Do the right things at the top and the people below will follow.  The same rules for everyone not just rules for the rank and file while leadership doesn’t abide by them.

   Full Text: Have supervisors spend at least 30% of their working hours performing the same work as the employees they supervise.  Too many supervisors spend their time attending unnecessary meetings, performing administrative tasks far below their pay grade (e.g., approving leave requests, unnecessary micro-management), and generally doing non-productive that does not further legally required workloads.

For too long, unelected career bureaucrats in the federal government have stifled efficiency by undermining the plans and policies of the Chief Executive.

I can testify that the vast majority of Federal employees are liberals and don't like his policies. Really do not like them. And a good number do resist policies they don't like. They do work slowly, or badly, or leak, or hide information, or lie, if they don't support the policies the politicals are pushing. And none of that happens if they support them.

They cannot go around doing immoral and unethical things without prosecution. Most of these bureaucrats shouldn't be there, they are basically GS-15s who need to be considered supervisors, but they are not. The SES themselves don't do any work either, they got promoted there based on DEI.

   Full Text: I support the OPM's proposed rule to create a Schedule Policy/Career classification for federal employees in policy-making roles. According to OPM's own findings, only 26% of federal supervisors feel confident they can remove poor performers, and just 41% feel they can remove employees for serious misconduct.

This is unacceptable in any workforce, especially one entrusted with implementing the laws of the United States. These policy staff are not mere functionaries; they influence key governmen...

   LLM Rationale: The comment discusses COVID vaccines and their implications for public health and individual choice, but it does not address the proposed rule regarding Schedule F or civil service protections, making it unrelated to the topic at hand.

They also have a proven safety record with few adverse effects. When these weighed on balance against the effects of long COVID, time off work from infection, and death of even healthy individuals from the disease they protect against, limiting availability makes no sense from a public health or policy perspective.

Opponents have falsely claimed this rule politicizes the civil service. In fact, the rule preserves merit-based hiring and explicitly states that employees are not required to support the President's views only to implement lawful policy faithfully. This rule is about accountability, not partisanship.

I believe your intent with this rule may put you at risk of undermining your own goal.

Program officers for the NSF and NIH should should be SCIENTISTS and DOCTORS! They know what research is the most promising for the public good. They are literally experts in the field. They also know how the process of scientific research works. They are also often sacrificing their own research paths to perform this public service.

   Title: Comment from Bei Phillips
   Key Quote: "I strongly urge Congress to reject the President’s proposed budget and instead prioritize the interests of the American people by reaffirming our national commitment to scientific research and innovation."
   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily discusses funding cuts to scientific agencies and advocates for increased investment in research without directly addressing the proposed Schedule F rule or its implications for civil service.

   Full Text: The recent funding cuts to key scientific agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Department of Energy (DOE) are deeply short-sighted and significantly undermine the United States' global leadership in scientific research and innovation. The NSF, which played a pivotal role in the development of the internet, exemplifies the critical importance of sustained investment in foundational research—an importance that cannot be overstated.

Civil servants should be just that. They should be subject to the forces of democracy. If the majority votes for fewer federal employees, there should be fewer federal employees. And vice versa.

They should be civil servants and not aristocrats. 


I support President Trump’s work to rein in unaccountable bureaucrats and end the Deep State!

Why should federal employees get to avoid layoffs all other employment sectors have been hit with over the last decade? Honestly the cuts are not nearly deep enough. The entire federal government needs to be slashed by a minimum of 1/3,with a goal slashing 1/2.

   Full Text: Even though I'm suspicious my comment may be used to tract Anti-Trumpers...I'm a brave American who'll risk it to help facilitate change. A President who does not understand his main job is to uphold the Constitution of the US, does not obey the Supreme Court or the Rule of Law...is a criminal and traitor to the US. He should be removed from office immediately as President.  
Add to that Trump allowed a know affiliate of our oldest enemy,  Russia, to plunder our government agencies such as Socia...
