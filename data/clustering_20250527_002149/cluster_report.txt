   Key Quote: "Thank you for bringing these unaccountable “civil servants” to heel."
   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the idea of holding civil servants accountable and suggests rolling back protections for disabled employees, indicating a preference for a system that prioritizes perceived merit and capability over existing protections.
   Text: Thank you for bringing these unaccountable “civil servants” to heel. One quick glance at any of the places that these supposedly “nonpartisan” employees gather (such as /r/fednews) makes it immediately clear that they do NOT share the can-do attitude and scrappy work ethic that the men who built this country embody. 

I further propose that employment protections and benefits for “disabled” employees and applicants be rolled-back as much as possible. Disabled persons are, by definition, less abl...

   Key Quote: "it is clear that the administrations goal is to eliminate merit based performance reviews in addition to worker & whistle blower protections under the guise of accountability & efficiency"
   LLM Rationale: The comment expresses concern about the elimination of merit-based performance reviews and worker protections, indicating opposition to the proposed rule. It highlights issues of poor leadership and the potential for politicization, aligning with themes that oppose the rule.
   Text:  At face value, it sounds to me, as a Manager of people with union contract protections, this law is written in response to poor leadership and management who do not have the necessary skills to coach and develop people for improvement or discern during the hiring process  the right people for the job or want to take the necessary steps to treat people equitably  should performance not improve and termination is necessary.

   Key Quote: "The proposal fundamentally alters the employment status and rights of a significant segment of the federal workforce established under laws enacted by Congress."
   LLM Rationale: The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting constitutional concerns, the importance of existing merit-based protections, and the potential for politicization of the civil service, indicating a strong defense of current employee rights and legislative authority.
   Text: Section E's rationale is untenable due to its failure to meet baseline standards for information quality and regulatory analysis, lacking objective evidence to support its cost-benefit claims. Moreover, the proposal constitutes an executive overreach into Congress's core legislative function of structuring the federal civil service and defining statutory rights. These analytical and constitutional deficiencies compel the proposal's rejection.

   Text: The proposed rule is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).

   Text: As a current federal employee and PMF alumni, I can say this move is not wise. The original intent of the EO that started this process listed numerous positions that could qualify under this new codification of the rule. Contracting in particular is at great risk.

Also, it prevents supervisors from ordering contracting officers to sign contracts that they do not agree with. This new provision of "schedule...

   Text: I am writing to disagree vehemently with the proposed OPM rule that would reclassify many career civil servants as "at-will" employees. There is no evidence that these employees are corrupt or lazy. The career civil servants I know personally are hardworking, smart individuals who have made a values-based choice to serve their country as opposed to making more money in the private sector.

There is no check or viable remedy against such actions with the removal of the MSPB for those employees.

   Text: The Benefits section asserts that faster removals will create “large gains in agency efficiency” but admits OPM “does not have a reasonable basis for estimating the magnitude.” E.O. 12866 requires the agency to quantify benefits where feasible.  At minimum, OPM can draw on:

   Text: The proposed rule OPM-2025-0004 is a terrible idea. Federal employees are already accountable in multiple ways. This is not about "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness", this is about politicizing civil service which should not be politicized.

Science in particular should not be politicized. Government scientists need to be unafraid to reach conclusions based on evidence, even if those are not the conclusions that higher-up political appointees  want them to reach.

Supporting Evidence: Strong due process rights in civil service promote equity, prevent abuse of authority, and protect against arbitrary or politically motivated terminations. Countries with weaker public sector protections h...

They work each day with steady hand,

From heights of power to each door,
Where civil servants stand in line,
To do their jobs by law’s design.

Seeks loyalty not earned by name,
But forced by fear, by threats, by might—
To dim the truth, obscure the light.

The proposed rule appears to conflict with established statutory protections under Title 5 of the U.S. Code, particularly Chapters 43 and 75, which govern performance-based actions and adverse actions, respectively. By reclassifying positions into Schedule P/C and removing these protections, OPM may be exceeding its regulatory authority, as these statutes were enacted by Congress to ensure fair treatment of federal employees.

   Text: Agency name (OPM), Docket ID (OPM-2025-0004) and RIN (3206-AO80)

To make so many more positions politicized would make them prone to turnover with every administration, which could mean the loss of this valuable knowledge. This would mean the services suffer. For example, in Federal programs which are run by States...

   Text: I wish to comment on the proposed rule changes to the procedures required to replace individuals in “policy setting/informing” positions. I am not opposed to any administration setting their policies within the context of their role in administering programs defined and funded by congress. While many of these policies decisions regard specific priorities, the extent of their impact should be defined by the laws funding a given program.

I oppose this bill which will create opportunity and motivation to use political ideology to hire and fire federal employees. A nonpartisan civil work force is key to a Balanced and Fair government. Myself and my family have been public employees and have always considered a workplace free from religious and political ideology and coercion to be the sacrosanct basis of doing the best job for the American taxpayer.

   LLM Rationale: The comment opposes changes to federal employee benefits, emphasizing the importance of upholding existing employment contracts and the trust between employees and the government. This aligns with concerns about due process and employee rights.
   Text: I’m writing to strongly urge you to oppose any budget reconciliation proposal that would unjustly decrease benefits for current federal employees against the terms and conditions of our employment contracts. 

Such a change would unfairly alter the terms of employment for those already serving and reduce our take-home pay. Federal workers have upheld our end of the bargain—changing the rules mid-career undermines trust and discourages public service, and frankly is a breach of contract.

   Text: The level of personal accountability in our government is already high enough to ensure high productivity. If the OPM seeks to improve employee productivity, it may look towards Congress to appropriate more funds for hiring—especially so for the IRS, where the government underfunding allows billions of tax dollars to remain uncollected each year.

Schedule F should not be implemented - government employees should be free from political pressure. Schedule F would allow harassment of employees to the detriment of a functional government.

This proposal is horrible public policy.

The proposal will not increase accountability; to the contrary, it will create nothing more than fealty on the part of employees to the politicians who appoint them.

Congress established a comprehensive framework for hiring, discipline, and removal in the civil service. This rule subverts that framework and exceeds the permissible bounds of executive discretion under Chevron U.S.A. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837 (1984).

   LLM Rationale: The comment opposes the rule by highlighting its negative impact on whistleblower protections and due process rights, indicating a concern for the integrity of the civil service and the potential for politicization.
   Text: Undermines Whistleblower Protections (5 U.S.C. § 2302)

By facilitating rapid removals with limited appeal rights, the rule chills protected whistleblower activity in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act. It directly contradicts the federal government’s statutory obligation under 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8) to shield employees who disclose wrongdoing.

   LLM Rationale: The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about circumventing the Administrative Procedure Act and the need for thorough analysis and transparency regarding civil service protections, indicating a defense of the current merit-based system.
   Text: Circumvents the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) Requirements

The proposed rule appears to be a pretext to revive elements of the former “Schedule F” executive order. Any substantial shift in civil service protections warrants thorough impact analysis and transparency, as required by the APA (5 U.S.C. § 553). A perfunctory notice-and-comment period is insufficient to support such a sweeping reform.

   Text: Conflicts with Due Process Protections (5 U.S.C. § 7513)

This proposal effectively dismantles statutory due process guarantees by enabling summary removals with reduced notice and appeal periods. This contradicts 5 U.S.C. § 7513, which mandates 30 days’ notice, an opportunity to respond, and representation. The rule thus violates both statute and constitutional due process standards established in Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985).

Error, favoritism, bigotry, retaliation, cronyism, corruption, ignorance of what an employee does, or mere whim on the part of any manager could result in the sudden, unjust and unreviewable termination of civil service careers. This does not just deprive...

They make policy based on the laws of the country, not the party who is in power. This rule takes away their professional freedom to do their jobs outside of the pressure of politics.

Re:  Office of Personnel Management

The new rule proposed by the Office of Personnel Management is just a sneaky way to fire federal workers for political reasons rather than for legitimate reasons.  Federal workers provide very valuable services, and, in my opinion, we need more of them, not less.  I believe that waste, fraud, and abuse should be removed, but this has to be done very carefully, and not for any political reason.  For these reasons, I oppose the new ru...

Our federal workers should not be subject to politicized firings.  Federal workers have first amendment rights and the threat of politicized firings infringes on that right.  Furthermore, a workforce that spends as much time worrying about being bullied and threatened (as is already happening) cannot be effective or efficient.  Stop holding threats over peoples' heads.

The current regulations allow for the dismissal of employees for mismanagement, bad conduct, or other behaviors not appropriate for Federal employees.  At will dismissal will undermine the ongoing ability to smoothly manage Federal agencies critical to the success of our democracy.

   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily seeks clarification on the definitions and scope of the proposed regulations without expressing a clear stance for or against the rule.
   Text: The definition of "policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating" is not immediately clear in these regulations and seems to border on problematically vague.  Do these regulations apply only to positions that create or influence policy that affect a large swath of Americans?  Do they apply to positions responsible for determining intra-agency or intra-governmental policies that only affect government operations and do not affect everyday Americans?

   Key Quote: "Simply working for the Federal government and making at least $75,000 in no way means someone is a "senior" employee or a "manager," and this pay level very often includes entry-level positions."
   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily requests clarification regarding the terminology used in a survey and does not express a clear stance for or against the proposed rule. It focuses on the accuracy of descriptions rather than the implications of the rule itself.
   Text: OPM cites a survey of "senior" Federal employees (also stated to be "managers") on page 17193 that seriously mischaracterizes the survey sample. Simply working for the Federal government and making at least $75,000 in no way means someone is a "senior" employee or a "manager," and this pay level very often includes entry-level positions. OPM should avoid using the words "senior" or "manager" to describe these employees to avoid misleading the reader.

   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the implementation of Schedule F, arguing that it is necessary for accountability and oversight of federal employees. The author expresses a belief that the current civil service system is outdated and abused, which aligns with the rule's goals.
   Text: This is very interesting. Every comment I browsed, maybe 20+, was against this regulation. And every comment except one, played the anti Trump, DOGE and Musk cards.

   Key Quote: "This rule does not weaken the civil service—it strengthens it by ensuring that policy-critical roles are filled by high-performing professionals who are capable of delivering results in alignment with the administration’s goals."
   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the proposed rule, arguing that it enhances the management of performance in policy-influencing roles and maintains a merit-based system. The author emphasizes the need for flexibility in managing these positions while asserting that the rule does not politicize the workforce.
   Text: I write in strong support of the Office of Personnel Management’s proposed rule to establish Schedule Policy/Career, as directed by Executive Order 14171. This rule represents a necessary reform to ensure that career officials in policy-influencing roles are held to appropriate performance expectations and can be managed in a way that supports effective, democratic governance.
Federal agencies today face significant challenges when it comes to managing performance in high-impact policy positions...

   Key Quote: "We strongly support this proposed rule, which makes career positions within the executive branch "at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals," which "will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.""
   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the proposed rule, emphasizing the need for accountability and the ability to remove underperforming employees, which aligns with the rule's goals of improving performance and responsiveness in the civil service.

   Key Quote: "I agree that schedule career/policy execs need to be reigned in, they are a blight on the workforce and a blight on the American taxpayer, whom they must serve, period."
   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the need to reclassify career/policy executives, indicating a belief that current bureaucrats are ineffective and should be held accountable, aligning with the rule's goals of efficiency and performance management.
   Text: I agree that schedule career/policy execs need to be reigned in, they are a blight on the workforce and a blight on the American taxpayer, whom they must serve, period. They cannot go around doing immoral and unethical things without prosecution. Most of these bureaucrats shouldn't be there, they are basically GS-15s who need to be considered supervisors, but they are not. The SES themselves don't do any work either, they got promoted there based on DEI.

   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the proposed rule, arguing for accountability and the need for easier removal of poor performers in policy-making roles, which aligns with the rule's goals.
   Text: I support the OPM's proposed rule to create a Schedule Policy/Career classification for federal employees in policy-making roles. According to OPM's own findings, only 26% of federal supervisors feel confident they can remove poor performers, and just 41% feel they can remove employees for serious misconduct.

This is unacceptable in any workforce, especially one entrusted with implementing the laws of the United States. These policy staff are not mere functionaries; they influence key governmen...

   Key Quote: "The proposed rule would help empower agency leadership to better manage the career workforce."
   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the proposed rule by arguing that it would improve accountability and management of civil servants, indicating a favorable stance towards the rule's implementation.
   Text: As a career civil servant of nearly 23 years I have seen a lot, particularly as a manager at a large agency. Most supervisors do not spend time on performance management, often because of the bureaucracy with respect to the disciplinary process. My attempts to suspend civil servants were all unsuccessful, either because the overwhelming evidence did not matter for a first-time offense (resulting in a mere reprimand that effectively meant nothing) or attorneys chose not to invest time with respec...

   Key Quote: "Given the substantial implications of these changes—for employee rights, agency operations, and the merit-based foundations of the civil service—it is critical that stakeholders have adequate time to analyze the proposal and submit meaningful comments."
   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily requests an extension of the public comment period without explicitly supporting or opposing the proposed rule. It emphasizes the need for thorough analysis and input, which does not indicate a clear stance on the rule itself.
   Text: I write to respectfully request that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) extend the public comment period for the above-referenced proposed rule for an additional 30 days, for a total of at least 60 days.

The proposed rule seeks to fundamentally restructure the accountability framework for career civil servants in policy-influencing roles by creating a new “Schedule Policy/Career” in the excepted service. The rule would remove these positions from the procedural protections of 5 U.S.C. cha...

   LLM Rationale: The comment requests specific data and analysis regarding the justification for the proposed rule without expressing a clear stance for or against it. It focuses on the need for evidence rather than addressing civil service themes directly.
   Text: Quantification of the Problem - “OPM cites anecdotal media reports and the 2020 & 2023 FEVS to justify Schedule Policy/Career. Please provide the econometric analysis (or any statistically valid study) that estimates the actual incidence rate of ‘policy resistance’, dis-aggregated by occupational series and GS-grade. Absent that, how can OPM satisfy State Farm’s evidence standard?”

   Key Quote: "OPM should calculate the anticipated change in costs associated with moving to Schedule Policy/Career that arise from increased recruitment efforts and fewer job protections for those in Schedule Policy/Career positions."
   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily requests clarification and analysis regarding the financial implications of the proposed rule without expressing a clear stance for or against it. It focuses on the need for cost calculations related to recruitment and retention, which does not align with the themes of support or opposition.
   Text: In Section D. Costs on page 17219, OPM states that implementing Schedule Policy/Career would not affect agency recruitment and retention efforts. Doing so also assumes that the likelihood of being fired under Schedule Policy/Career is identical to the current system - otherwise, pay would need to increase to attract employees and offset the reduced job protections. Because OPM does not propose a pay increase, OPM needs to assume that recruitment and retention will be unchanged.

   LLM Rationale: The comment does not explicitly support or oppose the proposed rule; instead, it suggests a recommendation for improvement in the discussion of poor performance. It does not engage with the core themes of politicization or civil service protections.
   Text: Section 2.i. on page 17189 (Adverse Action Procedures Make Addressing Poor Performance, Misconduct, and Corruption Challenging) relates to poor performance among career employees in general, and does not discuss or establish the extent to which personal policy differences are the cause of poor performance.

   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily requests additional information and examples regarding the proposed rule's justification, without expressing a clear stance for or against the rule itself.

   Text: Page 17191 notes that "Federal employees believe approximately one-in-four of their colleagues are poor performers," but fails to mention that this statistic is from 22 years ago. Additionally, it does not relate specifically to those in policy-making or policy-influencing positions. OPM should provide updated statistics on the subset of employees subject to Schedule Policy/Career in this Proposed Rule.

   Text: If you guys want to destroy the federal workforce then just do it already. Stop playing around with these nonsensical regulations and proposals. We can see through the writing on what you actually want to do. Heck I could've done a better job doing what you wanted to do at a cheaper, faster and less intrusive basis.

   Text: The costs of this proposed regulation are grossly and irresponsibly understated, and a proper accounting of the costs should be considered.

   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the proposed rule, arguing for accountability in federal employment and suggesting that current civil service protections hinder the ability to remove underperforming employees.
   Text: I am a Fed and I support this rule. As Federal employees we answer to the American people, and that means we have to report to the President and his agency heads. The current system makes it almost impossible to fire tenured Feds, and that is a problem if America is supposed to be a democracy with government by consent of the governed. There has to be accountability if someone is bad at their jobs. Right now there is very little.

As a prior Federal Employe Employee, I agree with the reasoning and legal support provided in this proposal. 

During my ~30 years of service, I found that organizations tended to follow their own direction when the leaders did not agree with elected officials and there was little to no accountability when they followed their own direction.

   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports actions that would reduce the influence of unelected bureaucrats, aligning with the proposed rule's intent to allow for easier removal of federal employees in policy-influencing positions.
   Text: I’m passing along my comments on this proposed rule based on my 40 years of federal government service for the HEW/HHS OPDIVs: SSA, OFA, OCSE, FSA, ACF, HCFA, and CMS. I had the opportunity to gain experience in fifteen job classification series while serving at these agencies.  During the earlier years of my career the agencies were solely interested in serving the American citizens, the latter was all about management building personal empires.

   Text: As a high school, I support the rule to make federally funded research free to the public. I often run into paywalls when trying to access articles for school, and it's frustrating because I can't afford them.

Making research open helps students learn from real, trustworthy sources, not just the internet or social media. If taxpayer money paid for the research, we should all be able to read it.

   Key Quote: "What a tragedy I am witnessing before my eyes."
   LLM Rationale: The comment expresses concerns about the state of science and innovation in America but does not directly address the proposed rule regarding Schedule F or civil service protections. It focuses on broader issues of funding and talent retention in science, making it unclear how it relates to the specific topic of the proposed rule.
   Text: What has made America strong is how well we have engaged in the activity of doing science.  Many in the world have emulated how we enact the scientific endeavor.  Many Nobel Laureates are American.  By shriveling the funding pool for science, not only do we dim out light to the world, but we hobble ourselves. We reduce our ability to create and innovate and to maintain a strong economy.  The best and brightest are now leaving our shores for better employment.  This will not do!  What a tragedy I...

   Key Quote: "I strongly urge Congress to reject the President’s proposed budget and instead prioritize the interests of the American people by reaffirming our national commitment to scientific research and innovation."
   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily discusses funding cuts to scientific agencies and advocates for increased investment in research without directly addressing the proposed Schedule F rule or its implications for civil service. Therefore, it does not clearly align with a stance for or against the rule.
   Text: The recent funding cuts to key scientific agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Department of Energy (DOE) are deeply short-sighted and significantly undermine the United States' global leadership in scientific research and innovation. The NSF, which played a pivotal role in the development of the internet, exemplifies the critical importance of sustained investment in foundational research—an importance that cannot be overstated.

   Key Quote: "Schedule F would improve the federal workforce by making thousands of public servants... accountable, transparent and hopefully responsible."
   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the reimplementation of Schedule F, arguing that it would enhance accountability and efficiency in the federal workforce, which aligns with the rule's goals.
   Text: Please read

I strongly support  the reimplementation of Schedule F as proposed in Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service."

   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily requests changes to management structures and input mechanisms without explicitly supporting or opposing the proposed rule. It does not address the core issues of Schedule F or its implications for civil service protections.
   Text: The agencies have several different layers of management creating extra levels of bureaucracy. Requesting to allow the "worker" staff to have an opportunity to rate their supervisors. 
In the technical fields, there are subject matter experts that have their voices silenced. The management is making decisions without taking into consideration the history and concerns of technical voices that are very concerned about patient care.

   Key Quote: "Think of it as turning five separate kitchens, each with their head chef, into one well-organized kitchen with clear leadership and experienced cooks who know exactly what they're doing."
   LLM Rationale: The comment discusses organizational efficiency and restructuring within a healthcare oversight office without addressing the proposed rule or its implications for civil service protections. It does not express a clear stance for or against the rule.
   Text: This healthcare oversight office (CMS/CLIA) has grown quite complex over time. Right now, it's set up with one person in charge and five separate teams. Each team has its own manager and advisor, plus 10-14 staff members for each team. These teams handle different tasks like budget, working with states, creating rules, enforcing those rules, and conducting inspections.

   Text: To whom it may concern. 
While efficient government is an wonderful idea, government is, after all, made up of people. People who have off days, who have had a squabble with their partner, people who are trying to live their own life.

   Text: Maybe we should start at the top and look at all the people making the decisions and red tape that affects the lower employees.  Always solve a problem at its source and the source is in laws and the poorly appointed “leaders”. Everyone should worry about themselves and not about others.  Do the right things at the top and the people below will follow.  The same rules for everyone not just rules for the rank and file while leadership doesn’t abide by them.

   Text: I have such mixed feelings.

   LLM Rationale: The comment discusses the need for better evaluation of supervisors without explicitly supporting or opposing the proposed rule. It focuses on employee feedback mechanisms rather than the implications of Schedule F.
   Text: What can be done with civilian supervisors who are poor performers?  We receive surveys for our leadership but nothing changes. Employees should rate their supervisor. This would empower the workforce and the Government would receive honest employment reviews.

   LLM Rationale: The comment does not explicitly support or oppose the proposed rule regarding Schedule F; instead, it focuses on the productivity of supervisors without addressing civil service protections or politicization issues.
   Text: Have supervisors spend at least 30% of their working hours performing the same work as the employees they supervise.  Too many supervisors spend their time attending unnecessary meetings, performing administrative tasks far below their pay grade (e.g., approving leave requests, unnecessary micro-management), and generally doing non-productive that does not further legally required workloads.

   Text: The COVID vaccines commonly referred to as Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax have demonstrated benefits in preventing the transmission and severity of COVID19 infections. They also have a proven safety record with few adverse effects.

   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports a method for holding employees accountable based on performance ratings, which aligns with the proposed rule's efficiency goals of easier removal of underperformers.

   Key Quote: "A President who does not understand his main job is to uphold the Constitution of the US, does not obey the Supreme Court or the Rule of Law...is a criminal and traitor to the US."
   LLM Rationale: The comment expresses strong political opposition to President Trump but does not directly address the proposed rule regarding Schedule F or civil service protections. It focuses on general political grievances rather than specific concerns about the rule itself.
   Text: Even though I'm suspicious my comment may be used to tract Anti-Trumpers...I'm a brave American who'll risk it to help facilitate change. A President who does not understand his main job is to uphold the Constitution of the US, does not obey the Supreme Court or the Rule of Law...is a criminal and traitor to the US. He should be removed from office immediately as President.  
Add to that Trump allowed a know affiliate of our oldest enemy,  Russia, to plunder our government agencies such as Socia...

What we need is TERM LIMITS as well as AGE LIMITS. Trump is deranged as well as delusional and the fact that Congress is allowing it all to happen makes them complicit just because they intend to use Trump, Vance et al as their scapegoat once the pendulum swings the other way.

That's a clear and present danger to our Nations ruling document. He won't call off Ice, he won't permit the GOP Congress to pass laws that stop his power grab.
