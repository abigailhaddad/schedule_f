   TRUNCATED TEXT (1001 characters):
   I am in complete opposition to this proposed regulation for “Improving
   Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service “
   (Regulation) submitted by the Office of Management and Budget under the Trump
   Administration. The federal civil service system , which is based on merit,
   was established by The Pendleton Act ( Act) of 1863. This Act was in response
   to the ineffectiveness and inefficiencies of the “Spoils System “ in which
   federal employment was based upon political loyalties or personal
   relationships. Career Civil Servants were further protected by enactment of
   the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, which stated that removal actions must be for
   merit-based reasons and not inappropriate causes, such as whistleblowing.
   Furthermore, under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the concerns that
   the merit-based civil service rules impeded agencies’ abilities to
   effectively manage employees and remove poor performance were addressed. This
   proposed Regulation is simply a ploy to...

   TRUNCATED TEXT (739 characters):
   I strongly object to the proposed Schedule F regulation. Reclassifying NIH
   grantmaking roles as "policymaking positions" subject to political
   appointment risks severely damaging the integrity of federal science funding.
   Politicizing leadership positions like Institute and Center Directors would
   undermine merit-based grant decisions, increase disruptive turnover, and
   jeopardize long-term research planning. Scientific expertise, not political
   considerations, should guide the allocation of federal research funds.
   Schedule F threatens to erode the scientific integrity of agencies like NIH,
   hindering progress and undermining public trust in science. I urge the
   exclusion of these critical science-related roles from this regulation.

   This order states Schedule Policy/Career employees: "are required to
   faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,
   consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive
   authority solely in the President. Failure to do so is grounds for
   dismissal." It also states that: "the President will make the final decision
   about which positions go into Schedule Policy/Career." And "guidance about
   positions agencies should consider in their Schedule Policy/Career positions"
   includes those with: "Substantive participation and discretionary authority
   in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the
   drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant
   applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients. Grantmaking is
   an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive
   discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy

   TRUNCATED TEXT (995 characters):
   I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the "Schedule F"
   classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based
   civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal
   workforce for over a century. If passed, this regulation would return us to a
   spoils system, in violation of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of
   1883. This act was passed to rid us of the corruption rampant in the
   executive branch of government during the Gilded Age and was a direct
   response to the assassination of President Garfield, who was shot by a
   disappointed donor promised an ambassadorship. The Pendleton Civil Service
   Reform Act ensured that the hiring and promotion in the executive branch of
   the government is based on merit; it also ensures stability in our federal
   government as hirings are non-partisan and not based on loyalty or patronage
   to any specific politician. Additionally, the vague and sweeping criteria for

   I am writing to express my concern over OPM-2025-0004, or as it is rather

   TRUNCATED TEXT (998 characters):
   As a current federal employee and PMF alumni, I can say this move is not
   wise. The original intent of the EO that started this process listed numerous
   positions that could qualify under this new codification of the rule.
   Contracting in particular is at great risk. The FAR indicates that the
   contracting officer has independence in the contracting process. Also, it
   prevents supervisors from ordering contracting officers to sign contracts
   that they do not agree with. This new provision of "schedule F" or
   "Policy/Career" is not going to help out the government. Employees will be
   afraid to be independent or speak out if in policy roles. This is crucial to
   the enforcement of the intent of congressional and presidential policies.
   There are other ways than using this new authority to achieve that goal. The
   use of political positions is better suited to achieving the directive
   desired here. Please do not lump in supervisors, contracting staff, anyone
   who touches policy, etc, that is in the...

   TRUNCATED TEXT (997 characters):
   I have serious concerns with the implications of this new regulation that
   would institute Schedule F, specifically as it relates to grantmaking. I
   refute the policy's language that "grantmaking is an important form of
   policymaking." In our society, grantmaking is merit-based and is meant to
   solve a demonstrable problem to improve the lives of citizens. It is not, and
   should not, be an instrument used for the implementation of any policy handed
   down from government. Reclassifying government jobs as policymaking positions
   risks serious waste in a few major forms: (i) time-consuming waste dealing
   with the turnover of positions with each new administration wanting to
   install their own picks for these positions; (ii) waste of investment as new
   administrations cancel existing federal funding however they deem fit based
   on whether it serves their policies; and (iii) research workforce erosion as
   investigators lose faith in the stability of federal grants with the change

   TRUNCATED TEXT (622 characters):
   Legislation is often difficult to understand for people without legal
   training. However the following statement stands out:"These positions will
   remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis. Yet they will be at-will
   positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals." The experience
   in other democracies is that even when there is a drastic change in
   administration, it's precisely the civil service that keeps the government's
   functions running. Somehow "career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis" and
   "at-will positions" is kind of an oxymoron. Keep these positions out of the

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   A bedrock principle of our republic is a professional and nonpartisan civil
   service, a system carefully constructed on merit since the passage of the
   Pendleton Act in 1883. The proposed "Schedule F" classification poses a
   significant threat to this enduring foundation. By potentially allowing the
   reclassification and dismissal without cause of a broad spectrum of career
   civil servants, particularly those engaged in crucial policy formulation and
   analysis, this initiative opens a dangerous pathway for political
   considerations to unduly influence hiring and firing decisions. This directly
   contravenes the spirit and letter of 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which clearly
   mandates that federal employment decisions must be rooted in merit-based
   principles, shielded from the vagaries of political influence. Furthermore,
   the imprecise and expansive criteria for inclusion under "Schedule F" raise
   serious concerns regarding the fundamental due process protections currently
   afforded to career federal...

   The rule of law is the cornerstone of the US system. It requires following
   the law of the land, specifically the separation of powers as outlined in the

   body or person. The organization of government that we have had since the

   would turn our merit system, which has worked for 150 years to ensure a
   professional and well functioning government, into a morass of incompetence,

   As a retired federal employee, I am deeply offended by this effort to
   politicize the professional, NONPARTISAN civil service. I worked under 6
   presidents, both Democrat and Republican. In 31 years of service, I never
   once learned or discussed any of my colleagues' political parties or views.
   We are professionals, experts in our fields, hired to provide advice,
   recommendations, background, based on our years of experience and training.
   By politicizing the civil service, you will not get unfiltered advice. I did
   not always agree with the final policy but I ALWAYS IMPLEMENTED IT. I swore
   an oath to uphold the Constitution and I never wavered from that. This is a
   terrible idea, a step toward autocracy.

   Our non-partisan civil service is one of the strengths of our government.
   Without undue political pressures, our public servants are best able to focus
   on the demands of their work, be it protecting the public's health, finding
   the next cure for disease, supporting our farmers, or otherwise pursuing the
   work for which they have the requisite training and experience. Political
   appointees are subject to the directives/whims of the current administration,
   whatever party it might be... and these directives/whims come and go while
   good science, law, and other critical work depend on stability and focus over
   time. Accountability in the civil service already exists, as well as
   mechanisms to ensure performance. The past few weeks of the current
   administration have already made abundantly clear the damage that can be done
   to essential public services by political appointees who lack the requisite
   knowledge and depth of experience to make decisions in the best interest of
   the American people.

   Making significantly more positions accountable to the sitting president

   servants are already accountable in several ways, and research tells us that
   politicizing public service leads less honest communication from appointees,
   more ideologically radical appointees, greater turnover in the workforce, and
   - as a result - to riskier and lower value outcomes and increased
   inefficiency and waste. It would harm scientific research and policy making,
   including medical, safety, and defense programs. It would allow elected
   officials to do away with the best research from the most qualified people,
   subject to rigorous peer review and public scrutiny, and replace it with
   something close to a politburo. In short it's not only a terrible idea; it's
   antithetical to better and less wasteful government - and moreover completely

   TRUNCATED TEXT (452 characters):
   I strongly oppose the proposed rule (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 / RIN
   3206-AO80) by the Office of Personnel Management. Federal employees should be
   protected from political influence to ensure a fair, professional, and
   trusted civil service. Reclassifying approximately 50,000 workers could make
   it easier to dismiss them for political reasons, which would undermine public
   trust and the integrity of our government. I urge OPM to withdraw this
   proposal.

   TRUNCATED TEXT (498 characters):
   These aren’t sound or rational concepts aimed or even proven to increase
   performance, accountability, or responsiveness. A scared employee pool is a
   group of people not interested in P, A, or R, but instead focus on pleasing
   their supervisor, sabotaging colleagues, doing only what won’t get them
   fired, never disagreeing or questioning anything, and never serving the
   public even close to any sort of civility. You all know this. Abusive
   unaccountable “employers” aren’t in anyone’s best interest.

   practiced law in both the private and federal sectors for almost 40 years.
   While in government, I served with undoubtedly the most talented, smartest,

   appointees, hired on the basis of donor status, party participation and/or
   personal loyalty,…. riding the coattails of their benefactors, but with no
   expertise, understanding of government or sense of accountability. The
   temporary status of an appointee simply does not engender the dedication or
   sense of mission that career civil servants internalize. Indeed, the
   protections afforded career civil servants enable them to perform reliably,
   professionally, without regard to personal political favor regardless of who
   holds the White House. Loosening the criteria for civil servants’ dismissal

   servants fired in this way would be given no justification and no right to

   Overall, the proposed rule is a bad idea. It may improve organizational
   performance by making it easier to to get rid or poor performers, but it is
   just as likely that it will get rid of outstanding performers who have
   unconventional ideas: remember the Apple “think different” ad campaign. The
   most likely outcome reclassifying a large number positions as “at will” is a
   culture of caution and conformity—people at every level just doing what the
   boss wants. Note, numerous fatal airplane incidents have been caused by a
   co-pilot’s caution in challenging the pilot’s judgement until it it too late.
   It makes a subtle switch from talking about policy-determining and
   policy-making to “policy-influencing.” Policy-influencing is an ill-defined
   and overly broad term. Almost anyone could be termed a policy influencer.
   Here is an example: “Substantive participation and discretionary authority in

   I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the "Schedule F"

   process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil
   servants, particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis to be
   reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the
   door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the

   adverse action procedures and appeals under 5 U.S.C. Chapters 43 and 75. This
   stands in stark contrast to previous OPM interpretations, which clarified

   disruptive to the ability to carry out programs and scientific initiatives .
   These regulations threaten the scientific integrity of federal grants,
   Project managers, Principle Investigators, division heads, should be
   appointed to help shape and direct scientific programs. Having these
   positions be political makes them subject to the whims of who is in office
   rather than to adhere to the goal of making scientific progress. I object to
   the proposed new regulation that would institute "Schedule F". a plan to
   enable the President to reclassify tens of thousands of government jobs as
   “policymaking positions” wherein the employees would serve at the pleasure of
   the President, and could be terminated summarily without the usual review and
   appeal process currently afforded Federal employees . This regulation would

   I write to express opposition to the proposed rule. The proposed rule titled
   “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil
   Service” (90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004) raises significant
   concerns about undermining the integrity and independence of the federal
   civil service. By easing the process for removing federal employees and
   expanding the use of term appointments, this rule risks politicizing the
   workforce and diminishing the protections that ensure public servants can
   perform their duties without fear of retaliation or political pressure. The
   merit-based system, a cornerstone of federal employment, is designed to
   promote stability, institutional knowledge, and nonpartisan service.
   Weakening these safeguards would not only reduce employee morale and job
   security but could also lead to a decline in the quality and continuity of
   public service delivery. Furthermore, the rule’s emphasis on expedited

   Schedule F. Schedule F is a plan that would result in the reclassification of
   thousands of government jobs as “policymaking positions”. This change would
   subject these positions to presidential appointment. This action would also

   This regulation would reclassify jobs that once fell under civil service

   First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the

   spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal
   employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly
   those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and
   potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to
   politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the

   it is true that early federal employment was politicized, the passage of the
   Pendleton Act in 1883 represented not a reluctant or temporary compromise,
   but an intentional pivot toward institutionalized merit, driven by public
   outrage over abuses. Rather than reinforcing executive control, the history

   higher paying jobs in the private sector. In my experience, agencies have
   highly loyal employees who are effective in their roles. In addition, when

   TRUNCATED TEXT (755 characters):
   Removing process protections from civil service jobs is a dreadful idea. It
   will politicize positions that are and should remain based on expertise, and
   we have already seen during this administration how officials selected for
   their loyalty to the president (rather than their systemic expertise) has
   cost us as a country. Doing what is already done with regard to about 4,000
   positions to another 50,000 positions spells disaster for the United States
   as cronyism will replace subject matter expertise and competence, further
   undermining confidence in government. But more importantly, it will make all
   Americans less safe as the chief characteristic for employability will be
   loyalty to one person in preference to any level of competence at one's job.

   I am against increasing the number or proportion of "Schedule F"
   classifications for federal workers. We got rid of the "spoils system" in
   1883 and it should stay gone. I consult with federal workers for their
   expertise in agriculture, hydrology, soils, and small business. I want them
   to be rewarded for skill, knowledge, and competence, and to stay in their
   offices so I and my fellow citizens continue to get the advantage of a long
   understanding of their fields.

   The proposed action which would allow Trump or any subsequent president to
   fire almost all of the leadership of the federal bureaucracy. This is bad
   because their jobs are to administer laws, and programs approved by Congress.
   The change would mean instead they need to do what the president wants or be
   fired. Currently, the Civil Service system limits direct political
   interference. The proposed action would convert an estimated 50,000 Feds to
   political appointees (so, down to lab/center directors? Division Directors?).

   The proposed change to Schedule F, to reclassify some positions as Schedule

   To quote a trusted source: “Politicization of public services generally

   influence of more ideologically radical appointees relative to more moderate
   civil servants. Politicization also reduces accountability. Bureaucrats
   worried about being fired fail to share uncongenial information with their
   political bosses and become less likely to respond to congressional
   oversight. As politicization begets lower transparency and administrative
   capacity, it increases waste and inefficiency.” In other words, this is a

   Regarding Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 from the Office of Personnel Management:
   In response to OPM guidance proposed on printed page 17188: I respectfully
   urge the administration to reconsider the proposed reclassification of
   federal grants administration roles as “policymaking positions”. This
   designation misrepresents the essential, nonpartisan work performed by these
   civil servants and could have far-reaching negative consequences for
   government accountability, efficiency, and integrity. Grant administrators do
   not set policy. Their work — drafting funding opportunity announcements,
   evaluating applications, and recommending awards — is guided by laws,
   regulations, and agency-established criteria. These roles are technical and
   compliance-based, not political or discretionary in the policymaking sense.
   To reiterate, these employees do not exercise independent authority to change
   the objectives or structure of grant programs; instead, they implement
   decisions already made by Congress or...

   Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 RIN: 3206-AO80 As a concerned citizen, I strongly
   oppose the proposed rule establishing a new “Schedule Policy/Career”

   proposed changes threaten the independence and stability of federal
   scientific agencies by allowing for at-will dismissal of career leaders, and
   eroding trust in nonpartisan, evidence-based leadership. I urge the Office of

   withdrawing this harmful proposal in its entirety.

   push their own agendas, and disallow freedom of speech and thought in the

   I am against this proposed change. As a recent former federal employee, I
   understand that it is difficult to remove career federal employees from their
   positions even with evidence of misconduct or poor performance, that is
   definitely an issue that needs to be addressed. However, removing an employee
   for not following Presidential directives is reflective of an authoritarian
   regime. This proposed policy change shows that fed workers must do as they
   are told no matter what. This is disgusting, anti-democractic, and
   anti-American. Fed workers should be trusted to do their jobs because of
   their demonstrated expertise, experience, and education, not because they are
   Trump loyalists.

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1002 characters):
   So these people that were already vetted for these jobs don't deserve it.
   These people that were veterans don't deserve them. These people that are
   educated in these fields don't deserve them. These people that were trained
   to become experts in these fields don't deserve them. Your position mskes no
   dense. They don't deserve their jobs, but your followers and your loyalists
   do? If they really, truly believe these sycophants deserve those jobs, have
   them apply like everyone else and compete for them. Why fire people that are
   already in their jobs to do favors for people? They have not applied or
   competed for anything but you want to hand them a federal job. It's not about
   efficiency or downsizing to save money. This administration is so mediocre
   that they want to take from someone else to give to their fans. They can't
   apply and get the open jobs on their own? The people in them have to be fired
   then so you can retire who you want? You are using your white privilege that

   QUOTE: "Civil service should be apolitical. Our bureaucracy should serve the people, not the politicians."

   TRUNCATED TEXT (463 characters):
   I am strongly opposed to this bill. The proposed rule risks politicization of
   the federal workforce and suggests no meaningful guardrails against this. The
   current administration will install political appointees which may suit those
   that voted for the current president. But it opens the door to allow the next
   president to appoint new people to serve their agenda. Civil service should
   be apolitical. Our cureacracy should serve the people, not the politicians.

   This order states Schedule Policy/Career employees: "are required to
   faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,
   consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive
   authority solely in the President. Failure to do so is grounds for
   dismissal." It also states that: "the President will make the final decision
   about which positions go into Schedule Policy/Career." And "guidance about
   positions agencies should consider in their Schedule Policy/Career positions"
   includes those with: "Substantive participation and discretionary authority
   in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the
   drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant
   applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients. Grantmaking is
   an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive
