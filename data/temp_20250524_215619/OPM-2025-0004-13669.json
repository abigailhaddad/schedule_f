    "key_quote": "It's a blatant attempt to stack the ranks of federal employees with loyalists, cowards, and yes-men who'll agree to any overreach by the executive branch, and who'll have no recourse if they don't choose to do that.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based civil service protections, and the lack of due process for employees. The language used indicates a clear stance against the rule's implications for nonpartisan governance."
