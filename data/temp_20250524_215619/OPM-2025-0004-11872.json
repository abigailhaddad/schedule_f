      "Merit-based system concerns",

    "key_quote": "I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about politicization, due process rights, and the undermining of a merit-based civil service system. The emphasis on protecting civil servants from political influence and maintaining their rights aligns with a strong opposition to the rule."
