    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the loss of experienced workers, the chilling effect on free speech and research, and the potential for increased costs due to legal challenges. These points align with themes of merit-based systems, due process, and politicization, indicating a clear stance against the rule."
