    "key_quote": "I strongly oppose the proposed rule because it would impair the functionality of the federal government as follows: The proposed category \"Schedule Policy/Career\" makes employees who work on policy or in a confidential capacity \"functionally at-will,\" eroding civil service protections that allow employees to work in an objective, evidence-based manner.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections and the potential for politicization of the workforce, which undermines the merit-based system and due process rights."
