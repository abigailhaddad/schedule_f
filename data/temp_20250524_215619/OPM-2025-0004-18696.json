    "key_quote": "Removing the civil service protections will not enhance accountability. In fact, it will diminish accountability by opening the door to graft, greed and the plundering of federal funds and resources by appointees secure in the knowledge that there will be no accountability for their actions as long as they remain in the good graces of the president.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, accountability, and the risks of politicization, which are all critical themes against the rule."
