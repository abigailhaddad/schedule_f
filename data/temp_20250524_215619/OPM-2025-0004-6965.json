    "key_quote": "The civil service is based in service to the people of the USA, not to a political party, or to a president. As such, civil servants should not be able to be fired on a whim or for political reasons.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of civil service protections, the risks of politicization, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge. It highlights concerns about job security and the integrity of federal employees, which align with a defense of the current merit-based system."
