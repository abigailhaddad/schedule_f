    "key_quote": "Since the proposed rule recognizes the \"value of a nonpartisan merit service that develops and maintains institutional knowledge and experience\", why does this proposed rule state that one of the necessities of its implementation and creation of schedule F is to ensure \"accountability to voters or their elected representatives\"? Please explain.",
    "rationale": "The comment raises significant concerns about the politicization of civil service and the erosion of merit-based protections, questioning the nonpartisan nature of the proposed rule and its implications for employee rights and institutional integrity."
