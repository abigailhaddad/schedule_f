    "key_quote": "I am writing to express strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) proposed rule OPM-2025-0004-0001, which seeks to reclassify approximately 50,000 federal employees into a newly designated Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) category.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of merit-based protections, increased risk of politicization, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge, all of which align with a defense of the current civil service system."
