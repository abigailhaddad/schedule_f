    "key_quote": "I am strongly opposed to politicizing over 12 times as many executive agency roles as are now politically appointed. I can see no way this will improve Americans' lives. Its only purpose is to make it easier for the leaders of the administration to impose their ideology on the government regardless of the objective facts.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based systems, and the potential negative impact on scientific integrity and employee rights."
