    "key_quote": "I express my unequivocal opposition to the implementation or reinstatement of the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal fundamentally threatens the merit-based civil service framework that has upheld a competent, apolitical federal workforce for over a century.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the implementation of Schedule F, citing concerns about its impact on the merit-based civil service system and due process rights, as well as the potential for politicization of federal employment."
