    "key_quote": "Civil servants should, by their very nature, be non-partisan. Permitting Trump, Vought, et al to replace all Federal civil servants with loyalists is not only counter-productive, it is undemocratic and un-American.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of non-partisan civil service and the dangers of politicization, which aligns with concerns about the integrity of the merit-based system and due process protections."
