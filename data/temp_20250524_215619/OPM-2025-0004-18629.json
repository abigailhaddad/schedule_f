    "key_quote": "The premise of this Schedule change is that the President\u2019s desires trump Congress\u2019s laws. This is a dangerous precedent, especially given this Administration\u2019s contempt for laws. That is why there is so much opposition to this Rule change.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of legal and constitutional principles, the potential for politicization of the civil service, and the undermining of merit-based systems. These themes clearly align with opposition to the rule."
