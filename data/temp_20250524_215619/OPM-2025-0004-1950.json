    "key_quote": "This rule seems to convert some of the civil service - intended to be independent and serving the Constitution - to de facto political appointees, incentivizing them to say only what the administration wants to hear and not actually speak truth, especially when the truth may be unpopular.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, cronyism, and the undermining of civil service independence, which aligns with the themes of merit-based system concerns and due process rights."
