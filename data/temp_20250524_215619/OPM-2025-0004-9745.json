    "key_quote": "Reinstating Schedule F will not only prevent/inhibit consistency, bipartisan objectivity and continuity from one administration to the next, but will further entrench and encourage the ongoing effort to replace our current \"quasi-democracy\"/ \"representative republic\" with a blatant fascist authoritarian government that relies on undying and unquestioning \"loyalty\"!",
