    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by arguing that it would allow for politically motivated firings, which undermines the merit-based system and due process protections for employees. Additionally, it highlights concerns about losing experienced workers who are essential for guiding political appointees, indicating a strong stance against the politicization of civil service."
