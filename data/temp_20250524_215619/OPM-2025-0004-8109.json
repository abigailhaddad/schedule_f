    "key_quote": "Reclassifying federal employees is a horrible idea that removes protections against the dismissal of employees at the whim of POTUS by reclassifying them as \"presidential appointees\".",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the removal of protections for federal employees and expressing concerns about the potential for politicization and abuse of power. The emphasis on due process and the dangers of unchecked presidential authority further solidifies its opposition."
