    "key_quote": "It violates the bedrock principle of a merit\u2011based civil service. By making tens of thousands of policy\u2011influencing employees at\u2011will, the rule enables mass firings based on ideology rather than competence.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its potential to undermine merit-based civil service principles and increase politicization, which aligns with concerns about due process and institutional knowledge loss."
