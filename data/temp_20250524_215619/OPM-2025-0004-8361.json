    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about politicization, the integrity of the civil service, and the potential negative impact on performance and accountability. It emphasizes the importance of a nonpartisan, merit-based system, which aligns with the themes of opposition to the rule."
