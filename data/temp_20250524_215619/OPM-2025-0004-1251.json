    "key_quote": "I object to the proposed new regulations that would formally revive Schedule F, a change that would strip civil service protections from around 50,000 federal employees and reclassify them as \u201cat-will\u201d employees.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the loss of civil service protections and the potential for politicization and arbitrary firings, which aligns with concerns about merit-based systems and employee rights."
