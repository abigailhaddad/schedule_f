    "key_quote": "Federal law has long said that civil servants must be hired, promoted, and retained based on merit. It is important that we use merit based systems to ensure that the brightest, most dedicated people serve to ensure the health, food safety, security, and services in the United States are the best in the world.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, emphasizing the importance of merit-based systems and the protections currently in place for civil servants. It raises concerns about the potential for politicization and loss of institutional knowledge, which aligns with the themes of merit-based system concerns and due process."
