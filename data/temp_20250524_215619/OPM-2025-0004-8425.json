    "key_quote": "Leave Federal auditing to actual qualified Federal auditors, maintain the status quo that protects the careers and non-partisanship of the Federal workforce. Do not approve the re-branded Schedule F, now Schedule P/C.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of non-partisanship, due process protections, and the risks of politicization in the federal workforce. It highlights concerns about the loss of institutional knowledge and the negative consequences of allowing political influence over federal employees."
