    "key_quote": "If it were easy for agencies to remove a civil servant, this would effectively make the position a politicized one, even if, on paper, they are said to be non-partisan.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the risks of politicization and the need for protections for civil servants, particularly in scientific fields. It emphasizes the importance of integrity and accuracy in research, which aligns with concerns about due process and merit-based systems."
