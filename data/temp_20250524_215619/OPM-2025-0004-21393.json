    "key_quote": "This proposal to convert 'policy-influencing' federal positions into at-will employment is not merely an administrative change; it is a dangerous step that threatens the very foundation of our impartial civil service, with severe repercussions for our nation's stability and economy.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the politicization of the civil service, the erosion of due process protections, and the potential negative impact on the merit-based system. The emphasis on maintaining impartiality and stability in federal employment clearly aligns with opposition to the rule."
