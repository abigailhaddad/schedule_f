    "key_quote": "Shifting some career civil servants into a new \u201cat-will\u201d category will not address this larger problem, in fact it will likely make matters worse.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing that the root issues in federal performance management stem from inadequate supervisory training and accountability, rather than the ability to remove employees. This aligns with concerns about maintaining a merit-based system and protecting employee rights."
