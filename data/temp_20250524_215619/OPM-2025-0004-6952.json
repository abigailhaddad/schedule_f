    "key_quote": "This proposed \u201cSchedule Career/Policy\u201d rule isn\u2019t just a bureaucratic change\u2014it\u2019s a betrayal of trust. It would give political leaders the power to fire experienced public servants with no cause, no due process, and no regard for the years they\u2019ve dedicated to our country.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about due process and the potential for politicization of the civil service, emphasizing the importance of protecting public servants from arbitrary political actions."
