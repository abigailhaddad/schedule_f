    "key_quote": "The point of having a career civil service is to make sure we have people working for our country who are NOT political appointees who will be swept out with the next election, but who are able to devote themselves to their jobs instead of flitting in and out like moths around a light.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a non-political, merit-based civil service and expressing concerns about politicization and the integrity of civil service roles."
