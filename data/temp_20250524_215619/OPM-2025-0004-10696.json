    "key_quote": "Schedule F would undermine that system. It opens the door for federal employees to be fired not for poor performance, but for refusing to ignore or enable corruption, misconduct, or reckless behavior by superiors or peers.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the politicization of the federal workforce, the erosion of merit-based systems, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge. It emphasizes the importance of due process and the integrity of civil service, which aligns with opposition to the rule."
