      "Merit-based system concerns",

    "key_quote": "A nonpartisan civil service is not a luxury. It is a safeguard against instability, favoritism, and dysfunction in government.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its potential to undermine merit-based civil service protections, remove due process rights, and invite politicization into roles that should remain impartial. The emphasis on safeguarding a nonpartisan civil service and the legal concerns raised further solidify the opposition to the rule."
