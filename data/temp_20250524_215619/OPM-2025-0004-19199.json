    "key_quote": "Civil service act of long ago cleaned most of the graft, cronyism and nepotism and now Trump wants to bring it back due to his need of payback against federal employees or kickbacks for donors.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the return of cronyism and nepotism, which aligns with a defense of the merit-based civil service system. Additionally, it expresses a clear concern about the politicization of federal employment under the current administration."
