    "key_quote": "The proposal to make these \"at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals\" is highly un-American;...making their employment \"at-will\" flies in the face of the trust that Americans place in their government to engage in a calm, dedicated, and clear process to evaluate government employees.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about due process and the politicization of civil service, emphasizing the importance of a merit-based system and the integrity of government service."
