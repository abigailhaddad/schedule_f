    "key_quote": "The proposed Schedule F rule would be a reversion to the political appointments of the spoils system era; federal employees would be hired, evaluated, promoted, or fired, based not on their merits - expertise and performance - but on their conformation to the political desires of the party in power.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about a return to politicization in federal employment, emphasizing the importance of a merit-based system and the dangers of political influence over hiring and evaluation."
