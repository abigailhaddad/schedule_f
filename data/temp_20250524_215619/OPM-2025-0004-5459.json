    "key_quote": "Implementing Schedule F (or whatever name this proposal now goes by) would undermine that independence and make civil servants the agents of politicians and their agendas, rather than Americans who pay their salaries through income taxes.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a nonpartisan civil service and the dangers of politicization, which aligns with concerns about maintaining a merit-based system and due process protections for employees."
