    "key_quote": "This proposed rule undermines the merit-based civil service system, increases political influence over federal workers, strips hard-working Federal employees including veterans of their due process rights, makes it easier to fire employees, and is the first step toward returning the United States to a broken political patronage system reminescent of the most corrupt governments in the world.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of the merit-based civil service system, the loss of due process rights, and increased politicization of federal employment, which aligns with the indicators for opposition."
