    "key_quote": "I believe employees have the right to due process, and it seems this sentiment is not shared with the current administration given the recent news of American citizens being sent to an El Salvadorian gulag without due process.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of due process and the risks of politicization in the civil service. It raises concerns about the erosion of merit-based protections and the potential for subjective evaluations of employee performance, which aligns with the themes of opposition."
