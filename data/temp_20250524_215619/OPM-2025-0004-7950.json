    "key_quote": "A 2024 survey by the Partnership for Public Service (800 US adults March 25 to April 1, 2024) found that 88% of Democrats, 87% of Republicans, and 79% of Independents agreed with the statement, \"Having a nonpartisan civil service is\u202fimportant for having a strong American\u202fdemocracy\u200b.\"",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a nonpartisan civil service and merit-based hiring, which directly counters the intent of Schedule F to politicize federal employment. It highlights concerns about public trust and the potential for corruption, aligning with themes of merit-based systems and politicization."
