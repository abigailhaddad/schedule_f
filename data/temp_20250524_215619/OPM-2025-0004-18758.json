    "key_quote": "This rule change, from me personal experience as a federal worker, lawyer and Judge, will dismantle the independent career civil service and reintroduce the corruption, patronage and cronyism that the Congress and Courts have historically found despicable since 1883.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about the erosion of merit-based hiring and the potential for increased politicization and corruption within the civil service. The author's extensive experience in federal service lends credibility to their arguments against the rule."
