    "key_quote": "Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections, the basic constraint against political interference.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its detrimental effects on civil service merit principles, job protections, and the risks of politicization, which undermine accountability and institutional knowledge."
