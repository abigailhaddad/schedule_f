    "key_quote": "Allowing the implementation of Schedule F will badly degrade the expertise and commitment of our federal workers and replace them with political actors who are gifted their jobs through a spoils system rather than earning it through their accomplishments in the relevant field, which is antithetical to the very fundamental values of our democracy.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a non-partisan civil service and expressing concerns about the degradation of expertise and merit-based hiring. It highlights the risks of politicization and the negative impact on democracy, aligning with themes of merit-based system concerns and politicization."
