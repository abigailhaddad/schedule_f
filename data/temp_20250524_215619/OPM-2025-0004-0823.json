    "key_quote": "The proposed \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d classification would be a disastrous policy to implement. By allowing political leadership to reclassify large numbers of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy development or analysis\u2014this measure would remove critical job protections and expose federal employees to politically motivated hiring and firing.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of merit-based hiring, due process protections, and the potential for politicization of civil service roles, which aligns with the indicators of opposition."
