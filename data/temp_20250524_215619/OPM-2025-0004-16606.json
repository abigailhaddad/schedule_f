It effectively dismantles legal safeguards for federal employees who refuse to engage in partisan activities or unlawful acts, opening the door to a system where personal or partisan loyalty overrides legal obligations.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the risks it poses to civil service protections, impartial governance, and institutional knowledge, which are all critical concerns against politicization."
