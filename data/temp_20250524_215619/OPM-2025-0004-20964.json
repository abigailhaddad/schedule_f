    "key_quote": "Denying these workers these rights to defend themselves will ultimately lead to a civil service that is partisan, as the president may remove civil servants at will for any reason and without ability to appeal or contest their removal.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of due process and the risks of politicization in the civil service. It highlights concerns about the loss of institutional knowledge and the integrity of nonpartisan service, which aligns with a defense of the current merit-based system."
