We don\u2019t need a government that\u2019s gonna take away our right to speak up. This rule needs to be stopped before it messes everything up even more.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the loss of experienced workers, the undermining of civil service protections, and the potential for politicization and fear among employees. These themes align with a clear stance against the rule."
