    "key_quote": "By making it easier to get rid of positions that are involved with policy it will make those positions more susceptible to policy of each administration rather than being able to serve the American people across administrations over the course of their career.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the rule by arguing that it would politicize career positions, making them vulnerable to the changing policies of different administrations, which undermines the principle of serving the American people consistently."
