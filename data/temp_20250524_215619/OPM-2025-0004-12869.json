    "key_quote": "If this rule is finalized as proposed, I expect to be reclassified as Schedule P/C, primarily due to my work described above. I anticipate that the rule will have a chilling effect on policy recommendations made by myself and other career civil servants because we fear retaliation for perceived political bias.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about its impact on due process, the integrity of policy recommendations, and the potential for politicization of civil service roles. The author's emphasis on the chilling effect on policy-making and the manipulation of regulatory analysis indicates a clear opposition to the rule."
