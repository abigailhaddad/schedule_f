    "key_quote": "Please provide a more full explanation of the need to remove civil service protections from employees in these positions, given civil service protections do not prevent an administration from terminating an employee that fails to uphold the constitution, fails to follow lawful instructions in faithfully uphold the law as directed by the executive branch, or engages in malfeasance or misconduct.",
    "rationale": "The comment primarily seeks clarification on the definitions and implications of the proposed rule rather than expressing a clear stance for or against it. It raises questions about the terms used in the rule and the rationale for removing civil service protections, which indicates a desire for more information rather than outright opposition or support."
