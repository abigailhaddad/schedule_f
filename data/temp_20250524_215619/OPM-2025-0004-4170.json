    "key_quote": "To undo almost 150 years of civil service reform to return to pre-reform corruption would be a massive step backwards for the country.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the risks of politicization and corruption associated with removing civil service protections. It emphasizes the importance of merit-based hiring and existing performance evaluation systems, which align with concerns about maintaining a nonpartisan civil service."
