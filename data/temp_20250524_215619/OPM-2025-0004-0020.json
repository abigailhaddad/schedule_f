      "Merit-based system concerns",
      "Due process/employee rights",

    "key_quote": "I do not trust that the proposed rule will improve the delivery of services by expert and experienced employees. I believe it will greatly reduce the quality of services (paid for with our taxes) provided by federal agencies.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based protections, and the potential negative impact on service quality. It emphasizes the importance of employee rights and the integrity of the civil service system."
