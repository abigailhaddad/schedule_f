    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures for diseases that impact all Americans, regardless of political ideology.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concerns about the politicization of the NIH and emphasizes the importance of having competent, educated employees making decisions based on merit rather than political influence, which aligns with opposition to the proposed rule."
