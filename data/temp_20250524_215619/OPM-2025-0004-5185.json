    "key_quote": "I strongly object to the Office of Personnel Management's proposed reclassification of federal workers via RIN 3206-AO80 to make these civil service workers vulnerable to being fired for political reasons, further eroding the American public's trust in the government.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization and the potential for political firings, which undermines trust in government and indicates a defense of employee rights."
