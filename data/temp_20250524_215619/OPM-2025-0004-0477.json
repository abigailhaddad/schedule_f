      "Merit-based system concerns",

    ],
    "key_quote": "I urge all government officials to fight against the Schedule F initiative and preserve what level of government efficiency we have remaining.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the Schedule F initiative by highlighting concerns about the loss of civil service protections, the inefficiency of replacing civil servants with political appointees, and the potential for politicization of the civil service. These themes align with a defense of the current merit-based system and emphasize the importance of institutional knowledge."
