    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed Schedule F changes by emphasizing the importance of job protections for maintaining a merit-based, non-partisan civil service. It raises concerns about politicization, employee rights, and the integrity of scientific research, all of which align with opposition to the rule."
