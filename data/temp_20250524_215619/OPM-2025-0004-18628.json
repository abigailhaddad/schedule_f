    "key_quote": "I believe that reclassifying the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements, and who oversee the review of grant applications, as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures for diseases that impact all Americans, regardless of political ideology.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong concerns about the potential politicization of the NIH and its impact on scientific integrity, indicating opposition to the proposed rule. The emphasis on maintaining public trust in science and the ability to innovate further supports the classification as 'Against'."
