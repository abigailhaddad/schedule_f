    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of merit principles, due process rights, and the risks of politicization in the civil service. The emphasis on protecting institutional expertise and nonpartisan governance further supports the classification as 'Against'."
