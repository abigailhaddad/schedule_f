    "key_quote": "In sum, the proposed rule would not only inhibit if not prevent successful presidential transitions, but it also would not improve but rather degrade the performance of government employees by replacing career civil servants with political appointees, and it would replace career civil servants loyal to the Constitution and rule of law with political appointees loyal only to the current president.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, arguing that it would undermine the merit-based civil service system and lead to politicization of government positions, which aligns with concerns about due process and employee rights."
