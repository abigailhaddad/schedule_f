    "key_quote": "I strongly oppose the proposed rule to allow the president to appoint Schedule F employees. This move represents a direct threat to the principles of an apolitical, professional civil service, undermining the long-standing norms of merit-based federal employment that are critical to the effective functioning of our government.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of nonpartisan expertise, destabilization of agency operations, and threats to accountability and transparency, all of which align with a defense of the current merit-based civil service system."
