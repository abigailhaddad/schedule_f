    "key_quote": "Under this proposed rule, the civil servants that stood up for the law at that time could have been reclassified and summarily fired. If this were to happen, the illegality may not have been uncovered in a timely manner and the intent of the laws covering EPA enforcement would have been violated.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the potential for politicization and the undermining of due process protections for civil servants, particularly in the context of historical abuses of power."
