    "key_quote": "I utterly oppose the Office of Personnel Management's Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 (aka \u201cRIN 3206-AO80\u201d.) It is unconstitutional; it is illegal; it is petty and punitive; and it will do irreparable damage to our country and our fellow Americans, especially to federal employees who have already been abused beyond belief.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about its constitutionality and the potential harm it would cause to federal employees. It emphasizes the importance of protecting civil service and due process rights, which aligns with a stance against politicization."
