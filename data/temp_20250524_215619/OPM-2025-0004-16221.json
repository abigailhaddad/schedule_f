    "key_quote": "I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw the Schedule Policy/Career proposal. By converting competitive\u2010service positions into at\u2010will appointments, this rule will inevitably shift federal decision\u2010making away from objective, law\u2010based analyses and toward political priorities.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based systems, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge, all of which align with a defense of current civil service protections."
