    "key_quote": "The proposed rule does not merely adjust personnel procedures; It fundamentally attacks the bedrock principles upon which the modern, professional federal civil service is built: Its provisions are irreconcilable with the historical evolution and statutory framework designed by Congress over nearly a century and a half to ensure a competent, nonpartisan, and accountable civil service.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses profound opposition to the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about its legality, potential violations of due process, and the undermining of merit-based civil service principles, which are central to the commenter's argument against the rule."
