    "key_quote": "Reclassifying rank-and-file FDA employees who occasionally work on policy issues into the excepted service would put our Nation\u2019s public health at unnecessary risk because these employees could be removed at any time without cause, thereby, jeopardizing the important work they do to protect the public by regulating industries that manufacture and sell our Nation\u2019s supply of food, drugs, medical devices, biologics, etc.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of civil service protections and due process for federal employees, particularly in the context of public health. It raises concerns about the politicization of the civil service and the potential negative consequences of the rule on the FDA's ability to function effectively."
