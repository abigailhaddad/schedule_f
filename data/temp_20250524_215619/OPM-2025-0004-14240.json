    "key_quote": "While the proposed rule claims to be trying to protect federal workers from increased politicization, the effect is the opposite: making it easier to terminate employees makes it easier to replace employees with people who are preferable to the current administration\u2019s proclivities.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization and the erosion of merit-based protections, particularly in light of recent layoffs that contradict the administration's claims about performance issues."
