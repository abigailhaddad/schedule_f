      "Institutional knowledge loss"
    ],
    "key_quote": "Better to have some stable people around who aren't all radical leftists but rather are just committed to doing their job because they love our country.",
    "rationale": "The comment supports the idea of retaining non-political hires to ensure stability and continuity in implementing an administration's agenda, which aligns with the proposed rule's intent to facilitate easier removal of career employees. The emphasis on having stable, non-political individuals in government positions suggests a preference for efficiency in governance."
