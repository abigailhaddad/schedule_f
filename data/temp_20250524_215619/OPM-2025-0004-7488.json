      "Merit-based system concerns",

    ],
    "key_quote": "This proposed rule makes clear that its goals are to ensure that all federal civil servants understand that they must do what the president says or risk losing their jobs.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about increased political control over civil servants, undermining merit-based systems, and the potential loss of due process protections. The emphasis on the need for non-partisan governance and the integrity of civil service further supports the classification as 'Against'."
