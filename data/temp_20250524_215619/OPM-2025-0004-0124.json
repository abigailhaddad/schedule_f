    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule, emphasizing the loss of due process protections and the risks of politicization in the civil service, particularly for scientists and statisticians. It highlights concerns about the integrity of data and the importance of nonpartisan governance, which aligns with opposition to the rule."
