    "key_quote": "I believe that the so-called Schedule F category is nothing more than a provision that allows removal of career civil servants without \"actual\" cause, allowing the President to insert employees who will carry out the President's political agenda without critical thinking.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the Schedule F rule by highlighting concerns about the removal of civil servants without cause and the potential for politicization, which aligns with themes of merit-based systems and due process."
