    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by emphasizing the need for non-partisan staff and stability, highlighting concerns about politicization and the potential for unfair treatment of employees. It advocates for a merit-based system and employee support rather than a system that allows for arbitrary dismissal."
