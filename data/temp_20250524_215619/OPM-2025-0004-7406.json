    "key_quote": "This is a dangerous rule written in purposefully vague and broad language, disgusting the true intent of those who drafted it - to politicize the career public servants.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based systems, and the elimination of due process protections for federal employees. It emphasizes the negative implications for democracy and the integrity of the civil service."
