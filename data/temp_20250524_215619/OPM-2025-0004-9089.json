    "key_quote": "Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections, and the basic constraint against political interference.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its departure from merit-based principles and the risks of politicization, which undermines civil service protections and organizational performance."
