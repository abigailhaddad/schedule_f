    "key_quote": "I oppose adoption of proposed rule to adopt \u201cSchedule F\u201d (now renamed Schedule Policy/Career). It is an executive order that would be a sharp break with long-standing, and effective civil service merit principles, which assume that career employees should be retained on the basis of performance and protected against political coercion.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about its impact on civil service merit principles and the potential for increased politicization, which aligns with the indicators for opposition."
