    "key_quote": "Reinstituting Schedule F would mark a regression toward a spoils system that prioritizes political loyalty over professional competence.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes Schedule F by highlighting its potential to undermine the merit-based civil service system, increase politicization, and threaten institutional integrity. It emphasizes the importance of nonpartisan governance and the risks associated with allowing political appointees to dismiss career employees based on ideology rather than performance."
