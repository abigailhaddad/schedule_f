    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures for diseases that impact all Americans, regardless of political ideology.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses clear opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization and its potential negative impact on scientific integrity and public trust in federally-funded science."
