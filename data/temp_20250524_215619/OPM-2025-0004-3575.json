      "Merit-based system concerns",

    "key_quote": "Difficulty removing problematic employees is not impossibility, and for me to agree that it is necessary to reclassify employees to make them easier to fire, I would need to believe that it is otherwise impossible to remove a problematic employee.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing that current systems for managing employee performance are sufficient and that the issue lies with managerial follow-through rather than the protections in place. This reflects a defense of the merit-based system and due process rights for employees."
