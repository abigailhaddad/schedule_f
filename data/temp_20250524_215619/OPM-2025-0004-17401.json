    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures, and treat existing illnesses that have or will impact every single American, regardless of political ideology.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the reclassification of civil servants into Schedule F, citing concerns about politicization and its negative impact on scientific integrity and public trust in federally funded research."
