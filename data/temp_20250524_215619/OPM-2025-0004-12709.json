    "key_quote": "I urge the Office of Personnel Management to rescind this rule in its entirety. If any elements are retained, they must be significantly amended to: \u2022 Preserve full due process and appeal rights; \u2022 Protect whistleblowers and independent adjudicators; \u2022 Reinforce merit-based hiring and promotion; \u2022 Prevent political retaliation; \u2022 Uphold statutory checks and constitutional balances.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule, citing concerns about the erosion of due process, merit protections, and the potential for politicization of the civil service. It emphasizes the need to uphold constitutional principles and protect the integrity of the federal workforce."
