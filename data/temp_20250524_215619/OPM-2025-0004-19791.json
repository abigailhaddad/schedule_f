    "key_quote": "The United States depends on a professional, merit-based civil service that puts public interest above politics. Politicizing career roles would degrade the effectiveness of government, introduce instability, weaken legal safeguards, and discourage long-term public service careers.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the undermining of merit-based systems, and the erosion of due process protections for federal employees. It emphasizes the importance of a nonpartisan civil service and the potential negative impacts of the rule on government effectiveness and employee rights."
