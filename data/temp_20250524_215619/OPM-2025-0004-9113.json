    "key_quote": "All federal employees take an oath to the constitution not to a political party, not to a president. They are there to do the work of the people and by making it so the sitting president can get rid of them and install people he favors, or those that align with his views is a terrible idea.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of nonpartisan service and the potential for politicization of federal employees, which aligns with concerns about merit-based systems and due process."
