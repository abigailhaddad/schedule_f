It is critical that those supporting and leading research remain independent and outside the sphere of political influence.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of independence in scientific research and the risks of politicization, which could undermine the integrity of the scientific process and disrupt long-term research leadership."
