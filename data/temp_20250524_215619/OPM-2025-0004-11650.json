    "key_quote": "The proposed rule would remove civil-service protections from a new category of federal employees called 'Schedule Policy/Career' (P/C). These P/C employees would be at-will workers without the right to challenge terminations or appeal reclassification to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the removal of civil service protections, the potential for politicization of the civil service, and the negative impact on institutional knowledge and public service delivery."
