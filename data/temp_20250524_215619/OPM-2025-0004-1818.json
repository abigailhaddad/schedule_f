    "key_quote": "But when career civil servants are classified as \"at will\" employees, they will lose this right to appeal and their independence.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the risks of politicization, loss of due process protections, and the potential negative impact on the merit-based system and institutional knowledge. It emphasizes the importance of independence for civil servants in maintaining trust and effectiveness in government functions."
