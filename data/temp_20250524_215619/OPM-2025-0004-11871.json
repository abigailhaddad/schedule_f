    "key_quote": "Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee's belief that the employee has failed to \"faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability.\"",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about politicization, due process rights, and the undermining of a merit-based civil service system."
