    "key_quote": "The potential replacement of these highly experienced career civil servants, whose subject-matter expertise has been developed over many years of specialized government service, with individuals who would not normally be considered qualified to assume these roles or undertake these responsibilities under existing civil service procedures would pose grave risk to the functioning of the U.S. government.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the integrity of the civil service, the potential for politicization, and the loss of institutional knowledge. It emphasizes the importance of due process and the merit-based system, indicating a clear stance against the changes proposed."
