    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the potential return to a politicized system of hiring and firing, which undermines the merit-based civil service protections established by law. It emphasizes the importance of upholding constitutional principles and the rule of law, indicating a clear opposition to the politicization of civil service."
