    "key_quote": "This proposed change is completely and wholly unnecessary as it goes way too far in giving the president too much power to weaponize his partisanship and pettiness to make it easier to purge the government of the people and services that hold corporations accountable, protect labor rights, ensure clean air and water, provide healthcare and Social Security benefits, and enforce the safety regulations that improve the lives of Americans.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about excessive presidential power and the potential for politicization of civil service, which undermines the merit-based system and due process protections for federal employees."
