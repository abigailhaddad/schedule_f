    "key_quote": "Maintaining protections for career civil servants enhances the functioning of American democracy because such federal workers have institutional memory, subject matter expertise and technical knowledge 'that incoming political appointees may lack.'",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes Schedule F by emphasizing the importance of protections for career civil servants and the risks of politicization and loss of institutional knowledge. It highlights concerns about due process and the potential for chaos in the federal government, which aligns with a stance against the proposed rule."
