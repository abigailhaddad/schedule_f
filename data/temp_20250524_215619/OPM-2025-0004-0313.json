    "key_quote": "I respectfully urge the withdrawal of any rulemaking that would establish or reinstate the \u201cSchedule\u202fF\u201d classification for federal employees. Such a change would imperil the merit\u2010based civil service system that has sustained a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for more than a century.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the implementation of Schedule F, citing concerns about its impact on the merit-based civil service system and due process protections for federal employees. It emphasizes the risks of politicization and the undermining of professional integrity within federal agencies."
