    "key_quote": "I strongly urge that federal workers not be reclassified by the Office of Personnel Management in order to make it easier to fire them... Reclassifying them will erode trust in our government, weaken or delete services, and widen the divide among our people that the current administration has caused by its catastrophically destructive actions.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the reclassification of federal workers, emphasizing the importance of nonpartisan service and the potential negative consequences of politicization, which aligns with concerns about merit-based systems and employee rights."
