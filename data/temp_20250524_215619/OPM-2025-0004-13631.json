    "key_quote": "Allowing thousands of policy-implementing positions to become at-will erodes the fundamental principle that civil servants serve the public interest, not political whims.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about due process protections, the risk of politicization, and the erosion of a merit-based civil service system. It emphasizes the importance of nonpartisanship and the integrity of the federal workforce, which aligns with opposition to the rule."
