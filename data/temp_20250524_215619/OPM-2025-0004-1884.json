    "key_quote": "Allowing this regulation to move forward sets the stage for rewarding political favoritism, rather than the merit system we have now, which only rewards those who are high performers and do the job they were hired to do impartially and without any political motivations.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, due process violations, and the undermining of the merit-based system. It emphasizes the legal and ethical implications of the rule, indicating a clear stance against it."
