    "key_quote": "The danger of eroding the separation between politics and administration cannot be overstated. It risks transforming a merit-based civil service into a patronage workforce where expertise is subordinated to loyalty tests.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based systems, and the importance of due process for civil servants. It emphasizes the need for an independent civil service free from political interference, which aligns with the themes of opposition."
