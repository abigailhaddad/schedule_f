    "key_quote": "This rule change will do nothing but endanger American lives. It is completely irresponsible, and no one who cared in the slightest for the general welfare---you know, one of those things that the Constitution says the government is to promote---would even consider doing away with the long-established procedures for hiring the best and the brightest to serve the nation.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of maintaining a merit-based civil service system and the dangers of politicization, particularly in terms of public safety and expertise. The author expresses concern about the potential loss of institutional knowledge and the negative impact on public welfare."
