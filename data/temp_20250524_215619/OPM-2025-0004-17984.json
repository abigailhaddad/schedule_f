      "Politicization concerns",
      "Scientific integrity"
    ],
    "key_quote": "Making Institute and Center Directors and most division directors at NIH appointees who serve at the will of the President directly counters this philosophical ideal and undermines the global scientific leadership that this nation has enjoyed over the last 75 years by eroding trust in one of the world's most respected biological and medical research organizations.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about politicization and its negative impact on scientific integrity and leadership. The emphasis on the importance of following evidence and maintaining trust in scientific institutions further supports the classification as 'Against'."
