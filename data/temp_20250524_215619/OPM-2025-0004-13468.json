    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the motivations behind it and framing it as a deceptive attempt to undermine federal employees. The mention of 'Christo-fascist authoritarian state' and 'gaslighting' indicates a strong opposition to the politicization of civil service."
