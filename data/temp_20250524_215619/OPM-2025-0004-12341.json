This plans intent is to stack the deck in favor of the current President/administrations agenda and make it easier for them to remove those who dare to think critically and earn the salary that they are getting paid.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the importance of merit-based hiring, and the value of institutional knowledge, indicating a strong defense of existing civil service protections."
