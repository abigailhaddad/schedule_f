    "key_quote": "Undermining a significant element of this unspoken agreement is not only unfair (and unwarranted) for people who have chosen a career that comes with less pay, but it also will undermine the effectiveness of the USG and our efforts to advance the President\u2019s policy agenda.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting the importance of job stability and the social contract between civil servants and the government. It raises concerns about fairness and the potential negative impact on the effectiveness of the government, which aligns with themes of merit-based systems and politicization."
