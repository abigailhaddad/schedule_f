    "key_quote": "I strongly believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees (especially at the NIH) who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH tremendously and with irreparable harm and reduce public trust in Federally-funded science.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization and its negative impact on public trust in science, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and the integrity of federal service."
