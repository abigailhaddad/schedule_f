    "key_quote": "Moving career civil servants into a category of 'at-will' employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee's belief that the employee has failed to 'faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability.'",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about political manipulation and the erosion of civil service protections, which aligns with themes of merit-based systems and due process rights."
