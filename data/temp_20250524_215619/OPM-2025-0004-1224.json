    "key_quote": "The whole idea of a civil service system is to ensure nonpartisan, professional, and consistent delivery of services. Politicizing it defeats the very purpose and turns government into an extension of campaign machinery.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, erosion of public trust, and the undermining of merit-based systems. It emphasizes the importance of a nonpartisan civil service, which directly contradicts the goals of the proposed rule."
