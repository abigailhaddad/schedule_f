    "key_quote": "By stripping many employees of their protections and potentially replacing them with at-will positions, this proposal could weaken the civil service, which relies on a skilled and independent workforce to serve the public interest.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, the potential for political influence in hiring and firing, and the impact on scientific integrity, all of which align with themes opposing the politicization of the civil service."
