    "key_quote": "The broad and vague definitions of 'policy-influencing' positions open the door to reclassifying career civil servants at the GS-13, GS-14, GS-15\u2014and potentially even GS-12 or lower\u2014levels into an at-will status. This undermines statutory merit protections, invites arbitrary removals, and violates both the purpose and the structure of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA).",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about undermining merit protections and inviting arbitrary removals, which aligns with themes of protecting the civil service and preventing politicization."
