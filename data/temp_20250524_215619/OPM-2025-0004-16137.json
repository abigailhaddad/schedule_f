    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in federally funded science, and reduce their ability to identify future cures, and treat existing illnesses that have or will impact every single American regardless of political ideology.",
