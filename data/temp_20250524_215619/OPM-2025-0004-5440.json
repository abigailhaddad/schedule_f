    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the importance of civil service protections and their role in maintaining a nonpartisan and effective federal workforce. It raises concerns about politicization and the potential loss of institutional knowledge, aligning with themes that inherently oppose the rule."
