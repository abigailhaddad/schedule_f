    "key_quote": "I object to this policy that removes due process from employee accountability and amounts to a thinly veiled \u201cloyalty\u201d requirement to Presidential directives, regardless of their scientific merit.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the removal of due process and the implications for loyalty to presidential directives, which suggests a politicization of civil service. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of scientific merit and evidence-based public service."
