    "key_quote": "Making it easier to fire hundreds of thousands of federal employees and replace them with political loyalists would make it easier to purge the government of the people and services that hold corporations accountable, protect labor rights, ensure clean air and water, provide healthcare and Social Security benefits, and enforce the safety regulations that took Americans out of the Gilded Age.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, accountability, and the potential loss of essential services and protections, which aligns with a defense of the current merit-based system and employee rights."
