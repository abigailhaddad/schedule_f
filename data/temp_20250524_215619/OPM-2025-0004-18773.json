    "key_quote": "I believe reclassifying career civil service employees involved in developing funding announcements and overseeing grant application reviews as Schedule F would reduce America's science and technology leadership... politicize the NIH, erode public trust, and hinder our ability to discover future cures and treat existing illnesses that affect all Americans, regardless of political affiliation.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of the NIH and the negative impact on scientific integrity and public trust, which aligns with the themes of opposition to the rule."
