    "key_quote": "The rule would create a new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d (Schedule P/C) classification that could be used to get rid of thousands of additional civil servants at SSA, giving the Administration even more power to undermine Social Security.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its potential to politicize the civil service, undermine due process protections, and harm the quality of public services, which aligns with concerns about the integrity of the merit-based system."
