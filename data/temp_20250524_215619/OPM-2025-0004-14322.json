    "key_quote": "The proposed reclassification of civil servants to at-will employees directly undermines the stated goal of preserving merit hiring.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of merit-based protections, due process rights, and the potential for increased politicization within the civil service. The emphasis on the integrity of the current system and the dangers of reverting to a spoils system further solidifies the opposition."
