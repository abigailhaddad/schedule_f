    "key_quote": "Schedule F would decimate the careers of civil servants like Serventi, whose knowledge and expertise have nothing to do with political loyalties or leanings, but everything to do with knowledge, excellence, and service to the rich history and artistic legacy of our great, and still aspiring democracy.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based systems, and the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise among civil servants. It emphasizes the importance of nonpartisan governance and the detrimental effects of political loyalty tests."
