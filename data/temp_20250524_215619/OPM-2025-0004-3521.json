    "key_quote": "Drop this insane, authoritarian power-grab. Continue to fill these positions with true civil servants, who will obey their oath to the Constitution, not the guy who wants to be a dictator.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by criticizing the intent behind it as a power grab for political loyalty rather than merit. It emphasizes the importance of constitutional duty and the need for qualified civil servants, which aligns with concerns about politicization and the integrity of the civil service."
