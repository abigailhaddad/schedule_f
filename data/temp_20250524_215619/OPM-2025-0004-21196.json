    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures, and treat existing illnesses that have or will impact every single American, regardless of political ideology",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concern that the proposed reclassification would politicize the NIH and undermine public trust in science, indicating a strong opposition to the rule and its implications for scientific integrity."
