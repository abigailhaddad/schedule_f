    "key_quote": "The proposed rule would facilitate just such substitution. By removing due process protections and enabling the removal of grantmaking professionals who disburse funds in ways disfavored by political leadership, the regulation creates a chilling effect on the lawful and neutral administration of congressionally approved programs.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of scientific integrity, due process protections, and the potential for politicization of federal grantmaking, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and constitutional governance."
