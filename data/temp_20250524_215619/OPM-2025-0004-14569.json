    "key_quote": "This proposal is a solution in search of a problem. It offers no compelling evidence that existing civil service protections are the root cause of performance issues, nor does it demonstrate that the proposed changes would improve outcomes.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of merit-based systems, due process protections, and the risks of politicization in the civil service. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity and public trust in federal agencies, which aligns with opposition to the rule."
