    "key_quote": "The proposed rule represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of public service. Civil servants pledge allegiance to the Constitution and the American people, not to any particular administration or political figure.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the politicization of civil service, the importance of a merit-based system, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge. It emphasizes the need for civil servants to remain independent and serve the public rather than political interests."
