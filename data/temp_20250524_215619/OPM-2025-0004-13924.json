    "key_quote": "By upending federal protections to these workers - you create a workforce that is vulnerable to gusts of political winds and you create an environment where workers will constantly consider the impacts to their job tenure instead of focusing on the mission.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the loss of federal protections, the potential for politicization of the workforce, and the detrimental impact on institutional knowledge and mission focus. These themes align with a defense of the current merit-based system and employee rights."
