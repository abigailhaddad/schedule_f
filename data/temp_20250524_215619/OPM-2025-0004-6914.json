      "Merit-based system concerns",
      "Due process/employee rights",

    "key_quote": "Civil servants take an oath to the Constitution and the rule of law. They are trained, and retrained, on their responsibilities when it comes to mission execution and adherence to law, policy, and principle.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of civil service protections, accountability through development rather than threats of firing, and the need for nonpartisan governance. It raises concerns about the politicization of civil service roles and the potential negative impact on employee rights."
