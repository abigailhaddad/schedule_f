    "key_quote": "There are employee problems everywhere - trying to blame and then get rid of Federal employees with so little understanding and changing the rules to make it \"easier\" is costly (currently over a Billion!! Dollars) is just plain stupid.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about breaking the contract with government employees, the existing processes for addressing non-performance, and the potential for politicization and misunderstanding of government employment. These points align with the themes of merit-based systems and due process rights."
