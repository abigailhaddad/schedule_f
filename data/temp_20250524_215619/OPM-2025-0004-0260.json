    "key_quote": "Removing the prerequisite protections that federal workers have in regard to not being \"fired at will\", and \"unable to speak truth to authority\" for \"fear of losing their job\", will create a spoils system that will reward unethical, illegal, and immoral behavior and subsequently fail to provide the very services our fellow Americans paid their taxes to receive.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the loss of due process protections for federal workers, the potential for politicization and cronyism, and the detrimental effects on institutional knowledge and service quality."
