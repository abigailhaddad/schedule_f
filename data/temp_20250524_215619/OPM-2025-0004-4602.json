    "key_quote": "I firmly believe that the action proposed which is designed to make it easier to remove these types of employees will not work at all and will simply serve as a feel-good measure but that is not the fault of the new administration, it is the fault of incompetent high-level federal bureaucrats who don\u2019t understand federal human resources well enough to actually explain why it won\u2019t work nor provide any reasonable alternatives.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by arguing that it will not effectively address the issues of poor performance and will instead perpetuate existing problems within the supervisory structure. It emphasizes the importance of due process and the need for competent supervisors, which aligns with concerns about merit-based systems and the potential for politicization."
