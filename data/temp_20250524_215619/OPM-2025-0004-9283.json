    "key_quote": "Schedule F is a dangerous tool that a President with criminal intent could use to replace talented, skilled, and experienced federal workers with people whose only qualification is complete loyalty to him.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to Schedule F, highlighting concerns about politicization and the potential for unqualified individuals to be placed in federal positions based solely on loyalty rather than merit. This aligns with the themes of politicization and the dangers of undermining the integrity of the civil service."
