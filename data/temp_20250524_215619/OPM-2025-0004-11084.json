    "key_quote": "I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based protections, and the potential loss of due process for employees. These themes align with a strong opposition to the rule."
