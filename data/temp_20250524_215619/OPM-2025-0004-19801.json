    "key_quote": "Making it easier to fire federal employees for political reasons will discourage federal employees from offering expert opinions on anything if they are afraid that their opinions could - even if those opinions are not actually politically motivated - be perceived as politically motivated and thus be a cause for termination.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, due process, and the detrimental impact on the federal workforce and public safety. It emphasizes the risks of firing employees for political reasons and the loss of institutional knowledge, which aligns with themes opposing the rule."
