    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about arbitrary dismissal and the loss of appeal rights, which aligns with a defense of due process and employee rights. Additionally, it raises issues about the potential loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, indicating a broader concern about the politicization of the civil service."
