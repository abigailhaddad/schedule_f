    "key_quote": "Of course, I agree that civil servants should be allowed to remain as nonpartisan experts, rather than loyalists to Trump\u2019s political agenda.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the idea of civil servants being politicized and emphasizes the importance of nonpartisan expertise, which aligns with concerns about the politicization of civil service. Additionally, the mention of feeling unprotected by the court system suggests a concern for due process and employee rights."
