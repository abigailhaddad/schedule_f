    "key_quote": "Stripping career protections from experts in policy roles isn\u2019t going to improve performance. It\u2019s going to install fear, suppress dissent, and turn the civil service into a political costume party where anyone who doesn\u2019t clap hard enough for the current administration gets tossed like an expired yogurt.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections and the potential for politicization of nonpartisan roles. It emphasizes the negative impact on merit-based systems and due process rights, clearly aligning with opposition to the rule."
