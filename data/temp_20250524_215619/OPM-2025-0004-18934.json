    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by expressing concerns about the erosion of the merit-based civil service system and the potential negative impact on institutional knowledge and employee performance. The reference to the 'spoils system' and the need for experienced civil servants indicates a clear opposition to politicization."
