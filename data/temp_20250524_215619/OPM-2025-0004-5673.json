    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the Schedule F rule, highlighting concerns about politicization and the importance of maintaining a non-biased civil service. It emphasizes the need for career civil servants to operate independently of political pressures, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and due process."
