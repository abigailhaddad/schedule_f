    "key_quote": "I am also very concerned that, because this order came from President Trump, it violates the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) and, thereby, the power of Congress to establish, define, and regulate the civil service system to protect the public interest in ensuring Americans have a federal workforce grounded in merit and free from corruption, political bias, and improper influences.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the undermining of merit-based systems, due process, and the potential for politicization of the civil service, particularly referencing the Civil Service Reform Act."
