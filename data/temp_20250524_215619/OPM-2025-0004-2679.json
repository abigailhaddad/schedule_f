    "key_quote": "Giving the President unilateral authority to reclassify positions into a new schedule with no real due process protections is not reform. It is not efficiency. It is patronage politics repackaged in bureaucratic language.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, lack of due process, and the undermining of merit-based civil service principles. The language used indicates a clear rejection of the rule's intent and implications."
