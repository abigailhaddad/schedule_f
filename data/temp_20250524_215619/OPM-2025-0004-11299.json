    "key_quote": "The beauty of the civil service, especially since its reforms from being a patronage system, has been to allow employees to think and act impartially, without fear of repercussion from recommending a course of action or acting in a way that was not aligned with the 'powers that be.'",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of impartiality and the ability of civil servants to act without political pressure, which aligns with concerns about politicization and the erosion of merit-based systems."
