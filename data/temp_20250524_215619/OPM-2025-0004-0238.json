    "key_quote": "This rule is awful, and should be shredded as soon as humanly possible.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the dangers of politicization and the importance of merit-based hiring, particularly in critical positions. It raises concerns about the potential for unqualified individuals to replace competent staff based on loyalty rather than qualifications, which aligns with the themes of merit-based system concerns and politicization."
