    "key_quote": "For these reasons, I strongly recommend that this rule change not be implemented. Should it be approved, it would work to deteriorate the quality of the bureaucracy while also weakening checks and balances that are the backbone of and have helped sustain America\u2019s healthy democracy.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule change by highlighting its potential to undermine democratic accountability and weaken the bureaucracy, which aligns with concerns about politicization and the erosion of merit-based systems."
