    "key_quote": "Overall this rule change will destroy the well-working, apolitical, civil service we have come to rely on for the past 50 years.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a protected civil service to prevent politicization and corruption, highlighting concerns about due process and the merit-based system. It also warns of the potential loss of institutional knowledge and best practices, which further aligns with opposition to the rule."
