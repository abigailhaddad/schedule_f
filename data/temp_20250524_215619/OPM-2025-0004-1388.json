    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of civil service, the integrity of scientific decision-making, and the potential loss of merit-based protections for civil servants. It emphasizes the importance of nonpartisan expertise in grantmaking and warns against the dangers of undermining democratic processes."
