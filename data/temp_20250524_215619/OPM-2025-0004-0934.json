    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the elimination of procedural protections for civil servants, which could lead to politicization and undermine scientific integrity and environmental compliance. The emphasis on the need for a NEPA analysis further indicates a stance against the rule."
