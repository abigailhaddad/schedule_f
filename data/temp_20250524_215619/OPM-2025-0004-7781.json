    "key_quote": "The proposed rule would instead codify politicization, diminish technical excellence, and jeopardize the return on every federal research dollar.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based protections, and the potential negative impacts on scientific integrity and technical capacity. The emphasis on the need for career civil service protections and the dangers of political influence clearly aligns with an opposition stance."
