    "key_quote": "Introducing political instability through Schedule F would: undermine the merit-based grant review process at NIH, including NEI; threaten evidence-based policymaking in public health and scientific agencies; disrupt career pathways for young scientists entering government service; cause significant staff attrition and institutional knowledge loss at federal agencies.",
