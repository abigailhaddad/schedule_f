    "key_quote": "This rule is unnecessary, unfounded, and unwise. Federal employees have already shown extraordinary resilience and dedication under immense pressure. To respond to that commitment by removing their basic workplace rights is both unjust and counterproductive.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about due process, the integrity of the merit-based system, and the potential for politicization of the civil service. It emphasizes the importance of existing protections and the commitment of federal employees to public service."
