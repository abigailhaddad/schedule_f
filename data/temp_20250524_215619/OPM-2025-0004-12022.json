    "key_quote": "This should be a bipartisan decision as it has been since incorporation. Stand up for our constitution, your children and grandchildren and be able to look yourself in the mirror and sleep at night by rejecting this amazingly HORRIBLE choice.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by expressing concerns about replacing career civil servants with partisan employees, which indicates a defense of the merit-based system and civil service protections. Additionally, it raises issues of politicization and the integrity of governance."
