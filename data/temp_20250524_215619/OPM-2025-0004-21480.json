    "key_quote": "Bureaucratic autonomy ensures that invaluable knowledge is carried over from administration to administration and that an incoming president cannot subject civil servants--government employees who serve the American people and protect the constitution--to loyalty tests or punish them for political reasons by stripping them of their employment.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of bureaucratic autonomy, constitutional protections, and the dangers of politicizing civil service, which aligns with concerns about merit-based systems and due process rights."
