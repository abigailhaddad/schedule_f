    "key_quote": "I believe reclassifying career civil service employees who develop funding announcements and oversee grant application reviews as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, erode public trust in federally funded science, and hinder our ability to discover future cures and treat existing diseases that affect every American, regardless of political affiliation.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the reclassification by highlighting concerns about politicization and its negative impact on public trust and scientific integrity, which aligns with the themes of opposition to the proposed rule."
