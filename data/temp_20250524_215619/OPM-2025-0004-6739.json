    "key_quote": "I am very concerned about this proposal's removal of civil-service protections from a new category of federal employees called \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\" (P/C) and that it gives the President sole authority to reclassify federal employees as P/C and removes their ability to challenge reclassification.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the removal of civil service protections, the potential for increased partisanship, and the impact on scientific integrity and public service delivery, all of which align with themes opposing the politicization of civil service."
