    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the loss of due process protections, and the importance of maintaining a merit-based civil service system. It argues that the rule would allow for arbitrary decision-making by political appointees, which undermines the integrity and professionalism of civil servants."
