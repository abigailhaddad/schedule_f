    "key_quote": "Federal employees cannot be in fear of losing their jobs because they do not compromise their integrity.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of due process rights, and the potential harm to the integrity of federal employees. It emphasizes the need for a non-partisan civil service and the protection of employees who provide factual assessments, which aligns with opposition to the rule."
