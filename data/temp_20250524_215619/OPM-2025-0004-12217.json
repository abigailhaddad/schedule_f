    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of scientific expertise in federal positions and expressing concerns about politicization and the potential for underqualified staff. It highlights the merit-based system and the integrity of scientific decision-making, which aligns with opposition to the rule."
