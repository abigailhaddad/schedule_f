    "key_quote": "This proposed rule is deeply troubling. Just focusing on its impact on scientific integrity: It would dilute the definition and enforcement of scientific integrity across agencies, remove key safeguards against political interference, and create an environment in which federal science can be manipulated or suppressed based on ideological pressures rather than empirical evidence.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, the potential for politicization of science, and the negative impact on governance and institutional knowledge."
