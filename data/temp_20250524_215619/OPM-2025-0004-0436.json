Weaken job security and due process rights for federal employees. Create instability and the risk of political purges. Harm the expertise and effectiveness of federal agencies.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its potential to undermine merit-based hiring, weaken due process rights, and politicize the federal workforce, which aligns with concerns about the integrity and effectiveness of civil service."
