      "Merit-based system concerns",

    "key_quote": "By elevating loyalty to the President above loyalty to Congress, the proposed rule is based upon a mistaken and harmful understanding of federal employees' appropriate role in American government.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about regulatory instability, the politicization of the civil service, and the undermining of the merit-based system. It emphasizes the importance of loyalty to Congress over the President, which aligns with themes of nonpartisan governance and employee rights."
