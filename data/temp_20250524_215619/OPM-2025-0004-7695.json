    "key_quote": "It's laughable that the PMO claims this is about removing poor-performing employees or that empty roles will be filled on a nonpartisan basis.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about politicization and the potential for abuse in removing employees based on political disagreements rather than merit. It questions the motivations behind the rule and emphasizes the importance of protecting hard-working Americans from arbitrary dismissal."
