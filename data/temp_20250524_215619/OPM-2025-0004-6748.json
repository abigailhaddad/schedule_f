    "key_quote": "In short, the career civil servants of this country are, by and large, dedicated, hardworking, and obedient to political leadership, providing important unbiased and apolitical analysis, research, and services to the American people. This proposed rule would only undermine that resource.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about its negative impact on performance, accountability, and the integrity of unbiased policy analysis. It emphasizes the importance of civil service protections and the potential for politicization, which aligns with the themes of merit-based system concerns and due process."
