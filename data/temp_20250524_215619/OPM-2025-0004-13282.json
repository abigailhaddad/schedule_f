    "key_quote": "Loyalty to a President, or to an administration, should not be a requirement for employment in these policy-connected jobs--on the contrary, with loyalty to the Constitution being the right and proper job criterion, along with intelligence, critical thinking skills, experience, and collaborative willingness to seek the best solutions, trying to make more, not less, positions appointed (at the whim of one regime or another) is counter to what the Founders had in mind.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of loyalty to the Constitution over political loyalty, highlighting concerns about politicization and the integrity of the civil service system."
