    "key_quote": "I strenuously oppose bringing back the Schedule F classification for federal employees. This proposal is the polar opposite of a merit-based civil service system that made the US the envy of the world in building a professional, non-partisan federal government workforce for more than a century.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the Schedule F classification, citing concerns about its impact on the merit-based civil service system and the potential for politicization in hiring and firing practices. It also raises legal concerns regarding due process and employee rights."
