    "key_quote": "The whole point of a merit-based civil service system is to ensure a qualified workforce that operates for the good of this country. The new process and flexibility in the proposed regulation is more likely to return to a spoils system and to promote the political biases the proposal claims to want to address.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about its inconsistency with existing civil service protections and the potential for politicization of the workforce. The authors emphasize the importance of a merit-based system and due process rights for federal employees."
