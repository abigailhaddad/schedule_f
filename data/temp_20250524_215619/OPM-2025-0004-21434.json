It bypasses Congress's clear intent in establishing a merit-based system, threatening to transform the professional bureaucracy into a partisan instrument, accountable to a single individual rather than the Constitution and the laws of the land.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about its constitutionality, the undermining of the merit-based civil service system, and the potential for politicization of the federal workforce."
