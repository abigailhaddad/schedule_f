    "key_quote": "I urge the Office of Personnel Management to withdraw its proposed \"Schedule Policy/Career\" classification rule. The proposal fundamentally contravenes constitutional principles of separation of powers and due process, exceeds statutory authority, cannot withstand judicial scrutiny, and undermines the merit-based civil service system established by Congress.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its constitutional issues, potential violations of due process, and the undermining of the merit-based civil service system, which are all critical concerns against the politicization of federal employment."
