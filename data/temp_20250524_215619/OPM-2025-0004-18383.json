    "key_quote": "Federal law has long said that civil servants must be hired, promoted, and retained based on merit\u2014basically: expertise, not political loyalty.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of merit-based hiring and the protections that allow civil servants to exercise professional judgment without fear of political retaliation. It raises concerns about politicization and the potential loss of experienced employees, aligning with themes that inherently oppose the rule."
