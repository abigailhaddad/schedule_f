    "key_quote": "Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections, the basic constraint against political interference.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes Schedule F by highlighting its departure from merit-based principles and the potential for increased political interference in civil service, particularly in scientific agencies."
