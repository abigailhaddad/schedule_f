    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures and treatments for diseases that could impact all Americans, regardless of political ideology,race or gender.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concerns about the politicization of the NIH and its impact on public trust and scientific integrity, which aligns with opposition to the proposed rule."
