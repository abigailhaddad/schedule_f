    "key_quote": "I fear that the proposed reforms to the OPM would result in federal employees being replaced in mass between presidential administrations and would unnecessarily politicize aspects of the government that work best when they are non-political.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concern that the proposed changes would lead to a less professional federal workforce and increase politicization, which opposes the rule. It emphasizes the importance of expertise and continuity in critical agencies, aligning with merit-based system concerns."
