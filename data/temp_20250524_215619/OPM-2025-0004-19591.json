    "key_quote": "It is completely unnecessary and would be incredibly dangerous and short-sighted to suddenly reclassify scientific personnel involved in developing, announcing, reviewing and enacting grant funded opportunities for scientists all over our great country as political appointees.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of scientific roles and the importance of maintaining a non-partisan civil service. It emphasizes the need for continuity and integrity in scientific work, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and due process."
