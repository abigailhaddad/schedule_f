    "key_quote": "The reclassification of some federal workers at 'at will' employees is a blatant attempt to politicize the federal work force so as to ensure that the Trump agenda will not face any opposition from employees - particularly those in policy related positions - who do not fall in line with this administration's wishes.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of the federal workforce and the erosion of job security for competent employees, which aligns with themes of merit-based systems and due process."
