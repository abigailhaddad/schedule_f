    "key_quote": "The proposed rule would reclassify federal policy roles\u2014making it easy to fire civil servants without cause. It removes protections based on merit and forces political loyalties into jobs meant to be nonpartisan.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of merit-based protections, the potential for politicization of civil service roles, and the loss of institutional knowledge. It emphasizes the importance of nonpartisan governance and the dangers of allowing political loyalty to dictate employment in civil service."
