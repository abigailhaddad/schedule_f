    "key_quote": "Please *do not* convert any Civil Service jobs into political appointments. These jobs rely on earned experience and expertise, and even a smart and well-meaning appointer or group of appointers cannot possibly have the range of subject area knowledge necessary to judge who will be the right fit for all of these specialized roles.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the conversion of civil service jobs into political appointments, emphasizing the importance of expertise and the risks of politicization, which aligns with concerns about merit-based systems and due process."
