    "rationale": "The comment questions the assertion that career employees insert partisanship into their duties, indicating a concern about the potential politicization of civil service roles. This aligns with opposition to the proposed rule, as it emphasizes the need for evidence before implementing changes that could undermine nonpartisan governance."
