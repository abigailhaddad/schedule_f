    "key_quote": "This change not only hands over unprecedented control over the civil service to politically motivated administrations, it also downgrades the conditions of employment that kept many career civil servants performing public service, notwithstanding better options in the private sector.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based employment, and the potential for corruption, which aligns with the themes of defending civil service protections and due process."
