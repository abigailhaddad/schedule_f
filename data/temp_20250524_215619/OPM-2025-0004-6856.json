    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based civil service protections, and the potential for authoritarianism. It emphasizes the importance of upholding the Constitution and maintaining institutional integrity, which aligns with opposition to the rule."
