    "key_quote": "Under this proposed regulation, I assume that a position such as a Congressional Relations Officer would be classified as Schedule F, which could result in having a new Congressional Liaison Officer with each change in administration, resulting in the need to build relationships from scratch, which wouldn\u2019t serve the new administration or the Congressional offices.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concern about the potential for increased politicization of civil service positions and the loss of institutional knowledge, as it suggests that frequent changes in key roles would hinder effective governance and relationships with Congress."
