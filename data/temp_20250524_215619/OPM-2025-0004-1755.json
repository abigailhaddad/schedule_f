    "key_quote": "I strongly oppose the proposed move to reclassify all management officials from the competitive service to the excepted service, effectively making them fire-able at will. This shift represents a dangerous step backward towards a spoils system of patronage, undermining the merit-based principles that have long been the bedrock of a nonpartisan and professional public service.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of merit-based principles, due process rights, and the potential for politicization of the civil service. It emphasizes the negative implications for democracy and the integrity of public service."
