    "key_quote": "I strongly oppose any effort to implement or revive the \u201cSchedule F\u201d classification for federal employees. This proposal would dismantle the merit-based civil service system that has protected a professional, nonpartisan workforce for over a century\u2014and would do serious harm to agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Center for Disease Control, where scientific independence is critical to public health.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the implementation of Schedule F, citing concerns about the dismantling of the merit-based civil service system and the potential for politicization of critical scientific roles, which aligns with the themes of merit-based system concerns and politicization."
