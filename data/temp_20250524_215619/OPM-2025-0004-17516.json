    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who administer review and allotment of research funding appropriated by the legislative branch for thousands of institutions across America as Schedule F employee would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures for diseases that impact all Americans, regardless of political ideology.",
