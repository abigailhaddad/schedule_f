    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, due process rights, and the potential for politicization of the federal workforce. The author's emphasis on the negative impact on veterans and the integrity of government functions further solidifies the opposition."
