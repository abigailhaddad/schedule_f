    "key_quote": "This regulation would throw this important and extremely useful tradition of nonpartisan support away, politicizing the civil service in a harmful way, and creating a reality whereby new administrations of both parties will be tempted to view civil servants as political animals that can or perhaps should be fired and replaced.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of the civil service and the potential loss of nonpartisan support, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and due process rights."
