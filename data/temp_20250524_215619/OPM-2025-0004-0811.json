    "key_quote": "The proposed rule will foster an environment where loyalty to the President becomes the determining factor in job security, rather than professional qualifications, expertise, and dedication to public service.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the undermining of civil service protections, and the potential erosion of a merit-based system. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining an independent and neutral federal workforce, which aligns with the themes of opposition."
