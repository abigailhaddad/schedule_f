    "key_quote": "A politically neutral civil service is essential for a robust democracy. Civil servants are entrusted to uphold the Constitution and serve the public interest, not to advance the agenda of any individual leader or political party.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a nonpartisan civil service and the risks of politicization, including the suppression of dissent and loss of institutional knowledge. These themes align with concerns about the erosion of merit-based systems and due process protections."
