    "key_quote": "The proposed rule, while it purports to preserve merit hiring, is fundamentally opposed to this goal, because it will reclassify career civil servants as at-will employees for the express purpose of making them easier to fire, regardless of merit, if they are perceived as pushing back on Presidential directives.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its potential to undermine merit-based hiring and civil service protections, emphasizing the importance of non-partisan civil service in maintaining trust in government."
