    "key_quote": "Making it easier to fire government workers at will, and without recourse is an expeditious way of turning 'non-political roles' into roles that by definition have to pay closer attention and be beholden to the whims of the political leadership.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of civil service protections, and the lack of due process for employees. It emphasizes the importance of professional career civil servants in maintaining government stability and integrity."
