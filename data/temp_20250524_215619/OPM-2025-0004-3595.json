    "key_quote": "I am strongly against this proposal, as it undermines the rights of Federal employees entitled to protection against arbitrary job losses - there are already policies and procedures to dismiss poor performing employees, this just creates an incentive to get rid of employees to make jobs for the President's supporters, which in turn defeats the purpose of the Pendleton Act.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about employee rights and protections, as well as the potential for politicization of federal employment, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and due process."
