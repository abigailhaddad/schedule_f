    "key_quote": "Schedule F, as proposed by Executive Order 14173, does the opposite. For the civil servants who faithfully perform their jobs on behalf of the American people, this order strips them of established workplace protections, leaving their continued employment to the whim of whoever has power over them.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes Schedule F by highlighting the loss of workplace protections and the potential for politicization of civil service roles, which aligns with concerns about merit-based systems and due process rights."
