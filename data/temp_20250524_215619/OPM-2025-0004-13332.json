    "key_quote": "Protections for Civil Service employees in non-political positions is critical for a healthy democracy. Otherwise, as is expected to happen if these proposed rules are enacted, the partisan political process can result in employees who face pressure to provide the public with political propaganda rather than FACTS.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of civil service protections and the risks of politicization, which could undermine the integrity and accountability of federal employees."
