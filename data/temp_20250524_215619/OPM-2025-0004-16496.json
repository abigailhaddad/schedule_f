The reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would do so IMO, and reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures for diseases that impact all Americans, regardless of political ideology.",
