    "key_quote": "Schedule F represents a sweeping change to the civil service system that bypasses the competitive hiring process and allows for the removal of career professionals without cause.",
    "rationale": "The comment clearly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, erosion of merit-based protections, and the loss of due process rights for federal employees. It emphasizes the need for a nonpartisan civil service and the importance of institutional knowledge, which aligns with a stance against the rule."
