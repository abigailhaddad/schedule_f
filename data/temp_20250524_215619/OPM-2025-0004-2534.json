    "key_quote": "My experience in the civil service has shown me that the vast majority of civil servants (all currently in career positions) perform their duties in a completely non-partisan manner. A large part of the reason we are able to do so and keep the country running so smoothly is due to career protections.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based protections, and the lack of due process for employees. The emphasis on non-partisan service and the potential for abuse aligns with a strong opposition to the rule."
