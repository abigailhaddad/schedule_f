    "key_quote": "The only 'problem' it addresses is the fact that the qualified professional civil service we now have may refuse to carry out the unlawful and unconstitutional whims of Donald Trump.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by criticizing its intent and expressing concerns about politicization and the integrity of the civil service. It emphasizes the importance of accountability to the American people rather than to political figures, aligning with themes of merit-based systems and due process."
