    "key_quote": "By stripping job protections from tens of thousands of experienced civil servants and opening the door to mass politicization of federal agencies, this rule would undo the merit-based system that has long kept science and public service focused on facts, not political agendas.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the loss of job protections, the potential for politicization of federal agencies, and the negative impact on scientific integrity and public health. These themes align with a clear opposition to the rule."
