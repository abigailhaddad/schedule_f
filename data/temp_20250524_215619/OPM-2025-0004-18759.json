    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the dangers of politicizing federal service and emphasizes the importance of a non-partisan, merit-based system. The concerns about credibility and decision-making based on political affiliation further align with the themes of politicization and the need for employee protections."
