    "key_quote": "If a particular administration is making unfair budget cuts and unduly firing people that do some of the hardest work -- it is failing those employees.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of job protections for federal employees, their nonpartisan service, and the need for due process. It raises concerns about politicization and the potential for unfair treatment of employees, which aligns with opposition to the rule."
