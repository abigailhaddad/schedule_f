    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of employee protections, and the potential negative impact on the merit-based system. The emphasis on the need for civil servants to remain unbiased and serve the American people further supports the classification as 'Against'."
