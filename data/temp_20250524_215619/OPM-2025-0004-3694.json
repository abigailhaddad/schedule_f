    "key_quote": "This rule does not fix performance issues--it weaponizes them. It enables sweeping reclassification of positions and eliminates the safeguards that protect employees from partisan retaliation and coercion.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of due process protections, and the undermining of merit-based systems. The author's emphasis on the dangers of loyalty tests and the chilling effect on civil service further supports the classification as 'Against'."
