    "key_quote": "The proposed regulation would erode the CSRA and return the government to the era of the 'spoils system' of the nineteenth century, when government jobs were gifts to the allies of elected leaders and their primary loyalty was to those leaders, not to the Constitution of the United States.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections and the potential for politicization of government jobs, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and due process rights."
