    "key_quote": "A central reason for having a meritocractic civil service is to eliminate patronage and to shield employees from arbitrary management actions not reasonably related to performance.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of merit-based protections, the lack of due process for reclassified employees, and the potential for increased politicization of the civil service. The emphasis on protecting employees from arbitrary management actions indicates a clear opposition to the rule."
