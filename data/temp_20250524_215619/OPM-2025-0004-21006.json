    "key_quote": "federal employment that is granted on the basis of a transient political agenda is prone to hiring individuals that will be conflicted in serving citizens that were in opposition of the executive currently in office",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a merit-based system, the risks of politicization in federal employment, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge. The concerns raised about the impact on long-term employment and the ability to attract talented individuals further align with opposition to the rule."
