    "key_quote": "Ensure that the best and brightest are in our public agencies \u2014 that science is the determining factor \u2014 not loyalty to one man and his agenda - do not allow the precepts of \u201c2025\u201d to become the norm and the rule of law for the United States.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of expertise and merit in public service, while criticizing the potential for politicization and loyalty over qualifications. This aligns with concerns about maintaining a merit-based system and protecting the integrity of civil service."
