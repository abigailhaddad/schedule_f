    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the importance of a merit-based system, and the potential negative impact on scientific integrity and public health. The explicit mention of being appalled by the policy and the consequences it would have on expertise and nonpartisan service further solidifies the opposition."
