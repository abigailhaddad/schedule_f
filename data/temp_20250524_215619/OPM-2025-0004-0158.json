    "key_quote": "This proposal would NOT improve performance and accountability BUT WOULD dangerously erode the merit-based foundations of the federal workforce and risks politicizing what has historically been a nonpartisan, professional civil service who only answers to the constitution NOT to a person or political party.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of merit-based systems, due process protections, and the risk of politicization within the civil service. The emphasis on nonpartisan governance and the integrity of the federal workforce further supports the classification as 'Against'."
