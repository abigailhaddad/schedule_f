    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of scientific funding and the potential negative impact on scientific integrity and public trust. The emphasis on expert oversight and the dangers of political influence clearly aligns with an anti-rule stance."
