    "key_quote": "Civil servants should worry about their duty to citizens and their oath to uphold the Constitution - not whether a mercurial administration will decide an employee has been loyal enough to deserve to stay employed.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of merit-based protections and expressing concerns about politicization and due process for civil servants. It critiques the potential for loyalty to the administration to overshadow objective performance standards."
