    "key_quote": "The reintroduction of Schedule F would dismantle a cornerstone of American democracy: an independent, expert, and apolitical civil service.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, the potential for politicization, and the negative impact on the quality of government services. It emphasizes the importance of a merit-based system and the risks associated with allowing political loyalty to dictate employment decisions."
