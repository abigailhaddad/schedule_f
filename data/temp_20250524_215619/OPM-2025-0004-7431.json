    "key_quote": "A return to the spoils system will make the federal government more wasteful, more corrupt and much, much less effective in delivering the congressionally mandated services to the American people which these agencies are intended to perform.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the return to a spoils system, which undermines merit-based civil service protections and emphasizes the need for nonpartisan governance. It critiques the potential for increased waste and corruption, aligning with themes of politicization and the importance of due process."
