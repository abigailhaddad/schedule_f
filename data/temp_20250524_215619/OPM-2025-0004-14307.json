    "key_quote": "The proposed rules are nothing but a blatant power grab by this administration to stock the entire government with political partisans, most of whom are willing to break the law and do a huge disservice to dedicated civil servants, and the public that they serve by making nearly every position into one that is highly politicized and under the control of the particular elected official in office as president.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about politicization, the undermining of merit-based hiring, and the erosion of due process protections for federal employees."
