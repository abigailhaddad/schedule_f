    "key_quote": "The public deserves the professional nonpartisan services civil service ensures and provides; most programs and services are only successful and get the results Congress intended by the enabling legislation when it is apolitical and independent of political interference to make decisions based on the evidence and science and not swayed by partisan preferences often opposed with what the law actual requires.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of nonpartisan civil service and the dangers of politicization, which aligns with concerns about merit-based systems and due process protections."
