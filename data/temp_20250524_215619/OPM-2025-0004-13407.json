    "key_quote": "Schedule F will remove these protections and render the employee an \"at will\" employee which means that they could be fired for no reason without the right to appeal.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of due process and protections for federal employees, highlighting concerns about politicization and the loss of institutional knowledge. It argues that the rule undermines democratic principles and the merit-based system."
