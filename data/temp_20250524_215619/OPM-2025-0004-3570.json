    "key_quote": "Add to this another 50,000 political appointees needed every 4 or possibly 8 years, and we have a recipe that guarantees that many, many more positions will go unfilled, hamstringing to an even greater degree, agencies that are supposed to be supporting the American public.",
    "rationale": "The comment discusses the challenges of filling political appointee positions but does not explicitly support or oppose the proposed rule. It focuses on the operational issues within government agencies without addressing the implications of the proposed rule on civil service protections or politicization."
