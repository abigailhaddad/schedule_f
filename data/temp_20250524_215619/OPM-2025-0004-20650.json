    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F has the risk of politicizing the NIH, reducing public trust in Federally-funded science, and impact the pace and ability to identify future cures for diseases that impact all Americans.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concerns about the potential politicization of the NIH and its impact on public trust in science, which aligns with opposition to the proposed rule. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity in federally-funded science."
