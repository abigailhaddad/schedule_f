    "key_quote": "Given that incoming Presidents often freeze, rescind, or replace the regulatory initiatives of their predecessors, why wouldn't an outgoing Presidential administration fire most of its Schedule Policy/Career employees?",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the potential for politicization of the civil service and the loss of institutional knowledge, as well as the lack of due process protections for employees. It emphasizes the risks of increased turnover and the negative impact on agency effectiveness, which aligns with a defense of the current merit-based system."
