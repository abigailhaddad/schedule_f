    "key_quote": "I strongly oppose the immediate implementation or revival of Schedule F. This proposal urgently threatens the merit-based civil service, risking politicized hiring and undermining the Pendleton Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), and due process protections under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the implementation of Schedule F, citing concerns about the threat to merit-based civil service and due process protections, which aligns with the indicators of opposition to the rule."
