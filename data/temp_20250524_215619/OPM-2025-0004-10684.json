      "Merit-based system concerns",

    "key_quote": "Federal law has long said that federal employees must be hired, promoted, and retained based on merit and expertise-- not political loyalty.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of merit-based hiring and the protections that allow federal employees to act without political pressure. It raises concerns about the potential for politicization and cronyism in the civil service, which aligns with the classification of 'Against'."
