    "key_quote": "This Regulation proposing that career civil servants be moved to Schedule F will ensure that all rank and file employees moved to Schedule F will be subject to this kind of intimidation and dismissal for simply adhering to laws, conceding to facts, calling out malfeasance, and performing their jobs in professional manners, when these lawful and ethical actions conflict with the goals and policies of the Administration in power, even when those goals and policies are unlawful.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed regulation, emphasizing the importance of a merit-based civil service system and expressing concerns about politicization and the erosion of employee rights. It highlights the potential harm to institutional knowledge and the integrity of the federal workforce."
