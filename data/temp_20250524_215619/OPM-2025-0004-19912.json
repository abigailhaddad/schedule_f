    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the reclassification of career civil servants, citing concerns about due process, merit-based hiring and firing, and the potential for politicization of the civil service. It emphasizes the importance of institutional knowledge and the risks of creating a 'Deep State' that undermines constitutional values."
