    "key_quote": "To change a system that IS NOT broken, and is in direct support to ALL our citizens is WRONG.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a merit-based system, the need for due process in employee removal, and the necessity of maintaining an apolitical civil service. These themes align with concerns about the potential politicization of the federal workforce."
