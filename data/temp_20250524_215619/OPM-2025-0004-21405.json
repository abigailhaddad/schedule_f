      "Merit-based system concerns",

    "key_quote": "This proposed rule reaches too far and undermines an efficient, effective and non-political federal workforce.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the potential for politicization of civil service roles and the erosion of due process protections for employees, particularly in providing honest legal advice. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a merit-based system and the risks of creating a workforce that is fearful of providing frank advice."
