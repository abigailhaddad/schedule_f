    "key_quote": "It perpetuates they mistaken belief that all government workers are tics on the body politic, giving nothing but disease at best and getting fat in the meantime.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by defending the effectiveness and efficiency of government workers, highlighting the unfair blame placed on them and criticizing the notion of gutting the workforce. This aligns with concerns about merit-based systems and the potential politicization of civil service."
