    "key_quote": "The proposed rule, while it purports to preserve merit hiring, is fundamentally opposed to this goal, because it will reclassify career civil servants as at-will employees for the express purpose of making them easier to fire, regardless of merit, if they are perceived as pushing back on Presidential directives.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, loss of merit-based protections, and due process rights for federal employees, indicating a clear stance against the rule."
