    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the functions of government, reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify the trust of government employees.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the reclassification by highlighting concerns about politicization and its negative impact on public trust in government functions, which aligns with themes of merit-based systems and integrity."
