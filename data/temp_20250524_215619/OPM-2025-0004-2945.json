    "key_quote": "The proposed rule poses a significant threat to the effectiveness of all federal agencies--and especially federal statistical agencies. By undermining the principles of merit-based employment and threatening the job security of many career civil servants, the proposed rule could lead to politicization, loss of trust and expertise, decreased morale, and disruption of agency operations.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses deep concern about the proposed rule's potential to erode protections for federal employees, undermine merit-based systems, and lead to politicization, which aligns with opposition to the rule."
