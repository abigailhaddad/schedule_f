    "key_quote": "Current law insists, correctly, on an impartial civil service. This effort to redefine the civil service terms of employment lacks any sort of clear, measurable, elements, and as such, should be rejected.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed regulation by emphasizing the importance of maintaining an impartial civil service and expressing concerns about politicization and the lack of due process protections. It critiques the regulation's potential to undermine existing laws and the integrity of the civil service system."
