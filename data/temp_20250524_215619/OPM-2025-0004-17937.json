    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about the reintroduction of a spoils system, the vulnerability of civil servants to political manipulation, and violations of due process rights. These points align with strong opposition to the rule's potential for politicization and erosion of merit-based protections."
