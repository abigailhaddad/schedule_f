    "key_quote": "This proposal is a terrible idea. It degrades the ability of the government to retain knowledgeable employees, whose value to agencies depends on their apolitical subject matter knowledge and insight, and who are often crucial to the functioning of their organizations due to their accumulated institutional knowledge.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the loss of institutional knowledge, the politicization of civil service roles, and the degradation of merit-based systems. It emphasizes the importance of objectivity and the detrimental effects on scientific integrity and agency functionality."
