      "Merit-based system concerns",

    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about the reintroduction of a spoils system, the vulnerability of civil service positions to political manipulation, and violations of due process rights. These themes align with a strong opposition to the rule's potential for politicization and erosion of merit-based protections."
