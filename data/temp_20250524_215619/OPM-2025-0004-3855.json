    "key_quote": "This proposed rule threatens the very principles that have guided that service for over a century. By allowing career civil servants to be reclassified as at-will employees and stripped of critical protections, it risks replacing professionalism with political patronage and undermines the core merit-based foundation of the federal workforce.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, due process rights, and the potential for politicization of the federal workforce."
