    "key_quote": "This change would not only irreparably injure the affected civil servants by subjecting them to capricious, potentially retaliatory firings, or other prohibited personnel practices. More importantly, it would jeopardize the goals of civil service reform, exposing the public to corruption, inefficiency, and unsafe practices.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the loss of civil service protections and due process rights for career employees, which aligns with concerns about politicization and the integrity of the civil service system."
