    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of civil service protections, the risks of politicization, and the potential negative impact on public health and effective governance. The themes of merit-based systems, due process, and scientific integrity are clearly articulated, indicating a clear stance against the rule."
