    "key_quote": "This rule is a dangerous proposal that would politicize the federal workforce, undermine scientific integrity, erode public trust, and reduce government effectiveness.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its potential to undermine civil service protections, merit-based hiring, and scientific integrity, while emphasizing the importance of a nonpartisan civil service. The concerns raised about politicization and due process further solidify the opposition to the rule."
