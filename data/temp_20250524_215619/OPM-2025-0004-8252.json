    "key_quote": "Politicizing public work will lead to even greater incompetence from our federal government. It will lead to a brain drain, a loss of wisdom and experience, and create even more personnel issues that will make it even harder for these government orgs to deliver services to the American people.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, loss of institutional knowledge, and the erosion of protections for public workers, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and due process."
