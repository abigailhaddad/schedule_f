    "key_quote": "The new Schedule F is shorthand for an executive order that will change policy away from one based on merit which means that career employees are therefore retained on the basis of performance and protected against political coercion.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of merit-based protections, increased politicization of the civil service, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge and efficiency. These themes align with a clear opposition to the rule."
