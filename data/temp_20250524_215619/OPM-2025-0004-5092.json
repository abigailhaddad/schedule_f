    "key_quote": "It politicizes public service. Many career employees are in their jobs through many different administrations. Having them politicized means every four years, there would be turnover throughout government, making it dysfunctional, not to mention a huge waste of taxpayer dollars.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of the civil service, the potential for decreased accountability, and the undermining of the merit-based system. These themes align with a strong opposition to the rule."
