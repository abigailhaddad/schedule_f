    "key_quote": "Changing the requirements would result in high turnover as each administration chooses its own, lower standards as the added requirement for loyalty rewards those of lesser merit, and higher costs since tenure results in greater efficiency and effectiveness.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a non-partisan civil service and the potential negative consequences of politicization, such as lower standards and inefficiency. It advocates for merit-based hiring and retention, which aligns with concerns about the rule's impact on civil service protections."
