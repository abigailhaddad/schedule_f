    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about its impact on federal employees and framing it within a broader critique of politicization and anti-democratic sentiments. The emphasis on the value of federal employees and the critique of the motivations behind the rule further supports the classification as 'Against'."
