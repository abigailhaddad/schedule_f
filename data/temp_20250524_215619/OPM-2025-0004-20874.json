    "key_quote": "Replacing them with political appointees would trigger constant turnover with each new administration, wipe out that deep knowledge base, and force entire research communities to re-justify foundational work every few years.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposal by highlighting the risks of politicization in scientific roles and the importance of maintaining a merit-based system with expert scientists. It emphasizes concerns about the loss of institutional knowledge and the potential negative impact on scientific integrity and public health."
