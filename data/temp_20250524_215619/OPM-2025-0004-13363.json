    "key_quote": "Transforming federal positions into an \"at-will\" category could significantly erode the due process rights currently afforded to these employees and create an environment where violations of key federal employment laws, particularly the Civil Service Reform Act, the Hatch Act, and the Whistleblower Protection Act, could occur more readily and be more challenging to address.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the potential erosion of due process rights and the risks of violating existing federal employment laws, which aligns with concerns about the politicization of civil service and the integrity of the merit-based system."
