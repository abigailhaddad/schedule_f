    "key_quote": "Schedule F is appalling! We've already seen Trump fill his cabinet and advisory position with unqualified toadies simply because of their loyalty to him.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by expressing concern over politicization and the potential for unqualified individuals to be favored based on loyalty rather than merit. It emphasizes the need to protect institutions and maintain a separation of powers, which aligns with themes of merit-based systems and due process."
