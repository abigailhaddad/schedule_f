    "key_quote": "Please rescind Trumps ruling and keep Bidens ruling in place.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by advocating for the retention of Biden's ruling, which implies support for existing civil service protections and merit-based systems. The mention of federal workers deserving better salaries and benefits suggests a concern for the welfare of civil servants, aligning with opposition to the proposed changes."
