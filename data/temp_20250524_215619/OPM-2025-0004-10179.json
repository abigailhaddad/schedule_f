    "key_quote": "Schedule F is an obvious and bad move to assert political control over essential work that can be effective only if done in response to the facts, rather than promoting the interests of whoever happens to be president at the time.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes Schedule F by emphasizing the importance of impartiality and independence in government work, highlighting concerns about politicization and the erosion of merit-based systems. The reference to historical context further underscores a stance against political control over civil service."
