    "key_quote": "This rule is gonna make it so people can\u2019t speak up anymore. If you can get fired just for speaking your mind or standing up for what\u2019s right, that\u2019s gonna make people scared to even say anything.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about employee rights, the potential for politicization, and the undermining of merit-based hiring and firing practices. The emphasis on fear of retaliation for speaking out and the ethical obligations of government employees further supports the classification as 'Against'."
