    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, due process rights, and the risk of politicization in federal employment. The emphasis on maintaining a nonpartisan and merit-based civil service further supports the classification as 'Against'."
