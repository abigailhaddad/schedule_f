    "key_quote": "This proposed rule- to give the President the authority to move career competitive service employees to Schedule F - will facilitate the politicization of the workforce, as the President will have the ability to fire anyone for any reason, unrelated to merit, and fill open positions with only those who agree with his political world view.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, due process, and the integrity of the merit-based system, indicating a clear stance against the implementation of Schedule F."
