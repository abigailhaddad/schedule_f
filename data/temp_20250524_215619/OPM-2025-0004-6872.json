    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by criticizing the administration's actions and suggesting that they undermine the integrity and effectiveness of the federal workforce. The themes of political decline and the negative impact on governance indicate a clear stance against the politicization of civil service."
