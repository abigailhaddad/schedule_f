    "key_quote": "I am strongly against employees serving at the will of one person, such as their supervisor or even the president. This is not democratic.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of due process and the democratic principles that protect federal employees from arbitrary removal by supervisors or political figures. It raises concerns about the potential for politicization and unlawful directives, aligning with themes of employee rights and protections."
