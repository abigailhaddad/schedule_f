    "key_quote": "Civil Service is indeed civil service and must be non partisan. We must keep our federal work force free to do their jobs without needed to take a loyalty oath to the current president.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization and the importance of a merit-based civil service. It emphasizes the need for nonpartisan governance and the potential harm of implementing loyalty tests, which aligns with the themes of merit-based system concerns and politicization."
