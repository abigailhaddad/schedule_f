    "key_quote": "I do not support this change and urge leaders to remove the clause allowing civil employees to be terminated because their actions do not align with presidential directives.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of hiring and retaining civil servants based on expertise and job performance rather than loyalty to the administration. It raises concerns about politicization and the undermining of democratic processes, aligning with themes of merit-based systems and employee rights."
