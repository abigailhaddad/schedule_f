    "key_quote": "OPM is proposing to replace a 2024 final rule that was promulgated after OPM published an NPRM with a 60-day comment period... and proposes to strip civil service protections from an estimated 50,000 federal employees, but OPM is providing half of the time to submit comments.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the reduction of civil service protections and the inadequate comment period, which suggests a defense of merit-based systems and due process rights for federal employees."
