    "key_quote": "This is a ridiculous overuse and overstep of power. Each federal civil servant was hired as the very best candidate to take an oath to the Constitution and perform their duties to the best of their ability.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the undermining of merit-based hiring, and the potential for abuse of power by political appointees, which aligns with the themes of protecting civil service integrity and employee rights."
