    "key_quote": "Designating more agency employees, like scientific program directors, as Schedule Policy/Career employees will make them easy to replace and increase the likelihood that science will be designed, selected, and carried out to suit political aims.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of science and the potential erosion of merit-based systems and due process protections for federal employees. The emphasis on the objectivity of scientific work and the risks of replacing experts with political loyalists further underscores the opposition to the rule."
