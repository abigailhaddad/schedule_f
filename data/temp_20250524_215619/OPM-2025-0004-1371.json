    "key_quote": "This simply makes workers more likely to be fired for nakedly partisan reasons, which is the exact opposite of the effect this rule claims to have.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, due process, and the integrity of the merit-based system. It argues that the rule would undermine non-partisan governance and lead to arbitrary firings based on political loyalty rather than job performance."
