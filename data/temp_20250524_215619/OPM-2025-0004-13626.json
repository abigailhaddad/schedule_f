      "Merit-based system concerns",

    "key_quote": "Unless you want to see a complete breakdown of belief in government as a reliable source of honest information, reject this proposed rule.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization and the potential for misuse of power to remove employees based on political motives rather than merit. It emphasizes the importance of a reliable civil service and the integrity of government statistics, which aligns with a defense of current merit-based protections."
