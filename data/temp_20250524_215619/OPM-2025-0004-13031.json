    "key_quote": "The proposed Schedule rule undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which institutionalized merit-based hiring; By creating an at-will employment category for policy-influencing roles, this rule violates the spirit and letter of 5 U.S.C. 2301 Schedule process afforded under U.S.C_ 7513, which guarantees notice, an opportunity to respond, written decision for adverse actions such as removal, demotion, suspension.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by detailing how it undermines existing civil service protections and due process rights, indicating a strong stance against the politicization of federal employment."
