    "key_quote": "This executive order will allow a large swath of civil service jobs to be handed out as favors to political cronies and donors without regard to qualifications, a system more often seen in poorly functioning states like Russia and developing nations with authoritarian leaders.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about merit-based employment, the potential for politicization, and the threat to American values and public health. It emphasizes the importance of expertise and qualifications in civil service roles, which aligns with a defense of the current merit-based system."
