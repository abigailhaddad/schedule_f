    "rationale": "The comment satirically critiques the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about loyalty over merit, the lack of due process, and the potential for politicization in federal service. The tone and content clearly oppose the idea of reclassifying civil servants in a way that undermines their rights and professional integrity."
