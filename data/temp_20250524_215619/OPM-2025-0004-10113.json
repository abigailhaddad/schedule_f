    "key_quote": "Civil servants are meant to be loyal to the rule of law, to facts, and to the constitution, not to a president.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of the civil service and the potential loss of integrity and accountability. It emphasizes the importance of civil servants' loyalty to the law rather than to political figures, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and due process."
