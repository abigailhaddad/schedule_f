    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about undermining civil service protections, politicization of federal employment, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge. The emphasis on non-partisan service and the importance of making decisions based on science and fact further supports the classification as 'Against'."
