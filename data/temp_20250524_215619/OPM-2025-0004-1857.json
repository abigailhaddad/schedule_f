    "key_quote": "The definition of \u201cpolicy affecting positions\u201d is too open ended and creating at-will employees will decrease the efficiency of the government where each administration will insert their people every 4 years undermining the government\u2019s ability to respond to the needs of the nation.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concerns about the potential for politicization of civil service and emphasizes the importance of constitutional adherence and professional service, which opposes the proposed rule's intent to create at-will employment."
