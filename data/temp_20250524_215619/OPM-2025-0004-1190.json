    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the loss of expertise, the potential for politicization, and the inefficiency it would introduce into federal processes. It emphasizes the importance of a merit-based system and the negative implications of allowing political influence over civil service positions."
