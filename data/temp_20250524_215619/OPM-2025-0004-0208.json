    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong concerns about the politicization of civil service roles, particularly in grantmaking, and emphasizes the need for nonpartisan expertise and protections for career civil servants. This aligns with opposition to the proposed rule, which could undermine merit-based systems and due process."
