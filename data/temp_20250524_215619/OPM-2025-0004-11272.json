    "key_quote": "Moving more government positions to appointed positions takes America back to the spoils system of the early 1800s, where the incentives were for the party in power to offer such positions not for merit but for bribes or favors.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about reverting to a spoils system, which undermines merit-based hiring and promotes politicization. It emphasizes the need for reform rather than increasing presidential power, aligning with themes of merit and nonpartisan governance."
