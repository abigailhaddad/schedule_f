    "key_quote": "This regulation would allow or even encourage supervisors to fire employees before the courts have the opportunity to rule, and this means it would undermine its own stated mission.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of the civil service and the erosion of due process rights for employees. It emphasizes the need for a merit-based system and the importance of protecting employees from being fired for resisting potentially illegal or unconstitutional directives."
