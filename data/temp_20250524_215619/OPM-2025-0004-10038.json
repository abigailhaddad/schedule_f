    "key_quote": "Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections, the basic constraint against political interference.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service merit principles, the potential for increased politicization, and the negative impact on scientific integrity and public service outcomes."
