    "key_quote": "Bureaucratic autonomy PROTECTS democracy, when, for example, civil servants respond to other legitimate authority, for example congress or the courts, and not the president.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of bureaucratic autonomy and the potential for politicization of civil service roles, particularly in scientific research. It raises concerns about the ability of civil servants to resist political pressures, which aligns with themes of merit-based systems and due process."
