    "key_quote": "The proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule is unnecessary, unjustified, and legally indefensible. It risks returning the federal government to the worst excesses of the spoils system under the guise of reform.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its legal flaws, potential for politicization, and threats to due process and the integrity of the civil service. It emphasizes the importance of merit-based systems and procedural safeguards, which align with a stance against the rule."
