    ],
    "key_quote": "The proposed rule, while it purports to preserve merit hiring, is fundamentally opposed to this goal, because it will reclassify career civil servants as at-will employees for the express purpose of making them easier to fire, regardless of merit, if they are perceived as pushing back on Presidential directives.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of job protections, merit-based hiring, and the risks of politicization in civil service. It highlights concerns about the potential loss of expertise and integrity in government positions, which aligns with the themes of merit-based system concerns and politicization."
