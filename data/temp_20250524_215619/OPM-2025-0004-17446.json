    "key_quote": "This OPM proposal would mean that the US grant process is more of a matter of deceiving inexperienced non-experts into giving you an empty promise of money that might get taken away at any moment.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the undermining of merit-based evaluations, and the potential negative impact on scientific integrity and funding stability. The emphasis on the need for protections against political interference further supports the classification as 'Against'."
