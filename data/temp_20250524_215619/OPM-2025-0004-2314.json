    "key_quote": "Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the Schedule F classification, citing concerns about politicization and the undermining of merit-based employment principles, which aligns with the indicators for opposition."
