    "key_quote": "The proposed regulation\u2019s broad and ambiguous language raises the alarming possibility that positions such as mine could be reclassified under the newly defined \u201cSchedule Policy/Career.\u201d Such reclassification would eliminate longstanding statutory civil service protections, including critical due process rights under Title 5 of the U.S. Code, thereby undermining the merit-based foundation of the federal workforce.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, due process rights, and the potential for politicization of nonpartisan roles, which aligns with the indicators of opposition."
