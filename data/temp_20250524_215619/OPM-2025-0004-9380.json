    "key_quote": "Currently, the Civil Service system limits direct political interference. The proposed action would convert an estimated 50,000 Feds to political appointees... This is ridiculous and will only serve to politicize our federal bureaucracy and lead to unqualified individuals running highly technical programs and agencies.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization and the potential loss of merit-based protections in the civil service, indicating a clear stance against the rule."
