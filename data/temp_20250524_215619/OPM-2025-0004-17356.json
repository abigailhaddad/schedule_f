    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes Schedule F by emphasizing the importance of due process and the merit-based system for civil servants. It raises concerns about politicization and the potential for arbitrary firings, which aligns with the themes of protecting employee rights and maintaining a non-partisan civil service."
