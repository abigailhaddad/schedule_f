    "key_quote": "President Trump and Musk\u2019s DOGE have not demonstrated that there is waste or inefficiency at the EPA. They are recklessly cutting budgets, firing workers, and eliminating vital federal agencies so that they can cut taxes for their donor friends (the wealthy and for corporations).",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concern about the reduction of government agencies like the EPA and criticizes the actions of President Trump, indicating a defense of the current merit-based system and civil service protections. This aligns with opposition to the proposed rule."
