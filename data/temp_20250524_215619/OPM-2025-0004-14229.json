    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of experienced civil servants and criticizing the potential for politicization and inefficiency in government. It highlights concerns about replacing skilled workers with less qualified individuals, which aligns with a defense of the merit-based system."
