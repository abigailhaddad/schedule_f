    "key_quote": "I write to respectfully oppose the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (\u201cOPM\u201d) proposed amendments to 5 CFR Parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, and 752, which would establish a new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d classification, reclassify career employees into this schedule, and strip affected employees of critical civil service protections guaranteed under Title 5, including Chapters 75 and 43.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about the removal of civil service protections and due process rights, which aligns with themes of merit-based systems and politicization of the civil service."
