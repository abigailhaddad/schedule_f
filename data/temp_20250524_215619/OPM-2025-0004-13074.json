    "key_quote": "This rule illegally strips federal employees of their appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 7511-7515), runs afoul of 142 years of precedent, and as-applied, will allow agencies to falsely reclassify positions as policy-making.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its potential to undermine employee rights, violate established merit-based systems, and facilitate politicization of the civil service, which aligns with the indicators of opposition."
