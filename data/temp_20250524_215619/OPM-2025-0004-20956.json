    "key_quote": "Scientists in science roles should enjoy robust protection from the perennially - and necessarily - changing opinions and interpretations of whoever is in executive or legislative roles.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the need for scientists to be protected from political influence and to maintain their roles as fact-based advisors rather than political appointees. It highlights concerns about politicization and the integrity of scientific work, which aligns with opposition to the rule."
