    "key_quote": "In sum, there are many mechanisms available to better align employee efforts with Administration priorities, but OPM fails to discuss any of those other mechanisms.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the existing mechanisms that ensure career employees can effectively implement Administration priorities without the need for reclassification. It raises concerns about due process, politicization, and the potential negative impact on career employees' independence and effectiveness."
