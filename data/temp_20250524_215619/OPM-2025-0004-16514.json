    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures, and treat existing illnesses that have or will impact every single American, regardless of political ideology.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses clear opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization and its negative impact on scientific integrity and public trust, which aligns with the themes of opposition."
