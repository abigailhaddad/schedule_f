    "key_quote": "Making these positions unstable will purposefully enshittify them - meaning only people who cannot get other positions (or are political in nature) will want them.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of stability and expertise in civil service positions, highlighting concerns about politicization and the loss of institutional knowledge. It argues that the current system provides necessary accountability and protections that would be undermined by the proposed changes."
