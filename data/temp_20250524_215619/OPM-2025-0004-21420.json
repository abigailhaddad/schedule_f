    "key_quote": "Making these positions political appointees takes away 1) the inherent subject matter expertise of the individuals serving in these positions, 2) the understanding of the policies in place that impact said agencies and divisions and programs, and 3) makes the implementation of various policies critical to the missions of these agencies/divisions/programs subject to the whim of whoever happens to be in charge.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the loss of expertise, politicization of civil service roles, and the detrimental impact on agency effectiveness, which aligns with the indicators of opposition."
