    "rationale": "The comment raises significant concerns about the legal rights and protections of federal employees under the proposed rule, emphasizing the need for due process and the potential for politicization of civil service roles. This aligns with opposition to the rule, as it highlights the risks of undermining employee rights and constitutional duties."
