    "key_quote": "Turning grant-making into a political loyalty test would cripple innovation, jeopardize public health, undercut economic growth, and diminish U.S. global leadership.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of scientific grant-making, the erosion of merit-based evaluations, and the potential loss of due process protections for grant reviewers. The emphasis on maintaining scientific integrity and independence further aligns with opposition to the rule."
