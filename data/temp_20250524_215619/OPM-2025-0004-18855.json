    "key_quote": "Changing this merit-based program, which has worked extremely well, to an 'at will' spoils system will create chaos (even more than we have had) and allow any administration to get rid of good, qualified employees solely because they do not follow the administration's political ideology.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of the merit-based system and expressing concerns about politicization and the potential loss of qualified employees. It highlights the risks of undermining civil service protections, which aligns with the classification of 'Against'."
