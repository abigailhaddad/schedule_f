    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the reintroduction of patronage and its negative impact on the integrity and professionalism of civil service positions, particularly in scientific fields. It emphasizes the importance of a merit-based system and the risks of politicization."
