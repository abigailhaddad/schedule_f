    "key_quote": "The proposed rule seeks to remove significant procedural protections for a specific category of career employees ('policy-influencing' positions placed in Schedule Policy/Career), effectively making them at-will employees without the right to appeal adverse actions to the MSPB or through Chapter 43 and 75 procedures.",
    "rationale": "The comment raises significant constitutional concerns regarding due process and the removal of protections for career employees, emphasizing the importance of merit-based systems and the risks of politicization, which clearly opposes the proposed rule."
