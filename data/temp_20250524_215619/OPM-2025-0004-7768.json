    "key_quote": "I urge OPM to withdraw this rule entirely. If any changes proceed, positions requiring advanced STEM expertise, professional engineering licensure, or responsibility for research portfolios and regulatory analyses must be explicitly exempted, and any adverse actions against technical staff should require independent scientific-integrity review.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of due process protections and the potential for politicization of civil service positions, which undermines the merit-based system and scientific integrity."
