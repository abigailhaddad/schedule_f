    "key_quote": "If civil servants feared discipline for voicing professional opinions that Administration leadership did not like, why would anyone reasonable sign up for a career where they weren't a valued, thinking, contributing team member?",
    "rationale": "The comment clearly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a merit-based system and the potential negative impact on civil service professionalism and employee rights. It raises concerns about politicization and the ability of civil servants to express their professional opinions without fear of retribution."
