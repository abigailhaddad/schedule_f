    "key_quote": "The proposed rule does not create or uphold a merit-based employment system for federal employees. The proposed rule would encourage politically-motivated hiring and firing decisions, which directly opposes the principles of merit-based employment.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of federal employment, the erosion of merit-based systems, and the potential for due process violations. It emphasizes the importance of nonpartisan civil service and the detrimental effects the rule would have on federal agencies and their ability to function effectively."
