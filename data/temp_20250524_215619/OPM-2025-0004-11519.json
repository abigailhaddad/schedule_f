    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based civil service protections, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge. It emphasizes the need for nonpartisan public servants and warns against the dangers of allowing political whims to dictate personnel decisions."
