    "key_quote": "Reclassifying them as \u2018policymaking positions\u2019 would subject these vital and non-partisan positions to presidential appointment and removal of those who occupy these positions. This would politicize fundamental science and life-saving discoveries and increase the turnover of key positions, and prevent longer-term planning and execution.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of non-partisan positions and the potential loss of expertise, which aligns with the themes of politicization and institutional knowledge loss."
