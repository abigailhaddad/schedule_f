    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures, and treat existing illnesses that have or will impact every single American, regardless of political ideology.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concern that the proposed rule would politicize the NIH and undermine public trust in science, indicating a strong opposition to the rule. It highlights the potential negative impact on scientific integrity and the ability to address health issues, which aligns with the themes of politicization and scientific integrity."
