    "key_quote": "Stripping career protections from experts in policy roles isn\u2019t going to improve performance. It\u2019s going to install fear, suppress dissent, and turn the civil service into a political costume party where anyone who doesn\u2019t clap hard enough for the current administration gets tossed like an expired yogurt.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, the potential for politicization, and the negative impact on merit-based performance. The language used indicates a clear rejection of the rule's intent and implications."
