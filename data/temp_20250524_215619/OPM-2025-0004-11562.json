    "key_quote": "The proposed change of removing civil-service protections from the new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\" category of federal employees would mean those workers would lose their right to challenge terminations or appeal reclassification to the Merit Systems Protection Board and would give the President sole authority to reclassify federal employees as P/C and remove their ability to challenge reclassification.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the loss of civil service protections, due process rights, and the potential for increased politicization of government functions, which undermines the integrity and efficiency of public service."
