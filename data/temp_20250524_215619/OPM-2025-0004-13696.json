    "key_quote": "I think it would be a huge mistake to create a system where these employees get replaced with administration loyalists - regardless of the party - as it would inject a huge amount of uncertainty into the regulatory process and subject our industry to being whipsawed by temporary changes.",
    "rationale": "The comment clearly opposes the proposed rule by expressing concerns about replacing career civil servants with political appointees, highlighting the importance of professionalism and expertise in regulatory agencies. This aligns with themes of merit-based systems, politicization, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge."
