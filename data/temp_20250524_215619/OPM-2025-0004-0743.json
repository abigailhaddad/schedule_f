    "key_quote": "It is a flatly unethical, anti-founding action to allow the executive the ability to freely fire most government employees on a whim.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting ethical concerns, potential for corruption, and risks to governmental efficiency, which align with themes of merit-based systems and politicization. It emphasizes the importance of protections for government employees and the dangers of politicizing civil service."
