    "key_quote": "Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections, the basic constraint against political interference.",
    "rationale": "The comment clearly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its detrimental impact on civil service merit principles and the potential for increased political interference, which aligns with concerns about politicization and the erosion of due process protections."
