    "key_quote": "Reclassifying large numbers of career civil servants, enabling the executive to fire them at will is not only an egregious overreach and likely a breach of the Civil Service Reform Act, it is nothing short of a naked power grab and should be opposed at every turn.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based systems, and the potential violation of employee rights. The language used indicates a clear stance against the rule, emphasizing the importance of an independent civil service."
