    "rationale": "The comment expresses clear opposition to the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of protections for federal employees and the negative consequences of politicization, as well as the value of institutional knowledge. The concerns raised about continuity and the effectiveness of government operations further align with a stance against the rule."
