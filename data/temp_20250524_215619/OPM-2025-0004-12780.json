    "key_quote": "I ask that the 'Schedule F with its directive falsely labeled, \u201cRestoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce\u201d be rejected since it doesn't provide for actual accountability for an employee's role and position, only skewed accountability to a temporary authority figure.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a nonpartisan civil service and the dangers of politicization, as well as concerns about the loss of skilled workers and the integrity of the federal workforce."
