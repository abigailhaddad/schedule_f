    "key_quote": "I strongly oppose moving more civil service positions into the Schedule Policy/Career category. This undermines the purpose of a merit-based civil service system and makes obtaining Federal jobs more partisan not less.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about undermining the merit-based civil service system and increasing partisanship in federal employment. It emphasizes the importance of qualifications over political connections, which aligns with a stance against politicization."
