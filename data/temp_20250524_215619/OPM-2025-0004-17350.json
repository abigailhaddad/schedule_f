    "key_quote": "My heart goes out to the employees that had to write this rule knowing that the rule strips them of their right to appeal separation to the MSPB and means the each future president may fire them for no reason.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses clear opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the loss of employee rights and due process, as well as the potential for increased politicization of the civil service. The emphasis on the negative impact on employees' rights and the integrity of the civil service indicates a strong stance against the rule."
