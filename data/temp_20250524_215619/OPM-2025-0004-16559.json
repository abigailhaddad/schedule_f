    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of non-partisan career civil service protections to maintain accountability and prevent politicization in procurement processes. It highlights concerns about potential coercion and the negative impact on taxpayer interests, aligning with themes of merit-based systems and due process."
