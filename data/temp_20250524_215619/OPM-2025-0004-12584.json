    "key_quote": "How is the public to know whether career employees at OPM, perhaps those drafting this very Proposed Rule, are the same career employees injecting their personal partisanship into their work and undermining the President?",
    "rationale": "The comment raises concerns about the potential for career employees to inject partisanship into their work, which indicates a fear of politicization within the civil service. This aligns with opposition to the proposed rule, as it suggests a lack of trust in the current merit-based system."
