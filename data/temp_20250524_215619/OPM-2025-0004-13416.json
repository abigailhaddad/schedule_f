    "key_quote": "This regulation will support the firing of persons at whim and labeling it as 'at will' employment. It moves the U.S. government workforce toward toadyism and away from non-partisan merit-based government and should not be approved.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed regulation, highlighting concerns about the erosion of due process protections and the potential for politicization of the civil service. It emphasizes the importance of a merit-based system and the risks of arbitrary dismissals, which align with the themes of opposition."
