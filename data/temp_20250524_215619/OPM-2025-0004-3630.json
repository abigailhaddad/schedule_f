    "key_quote": "There are already politically-appointed positions throughout the federal government to aid in implementing the President's agenda, while being balanced by statutorily-mandated agencies and their workforce who are at the service of the US Constitution.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting the importance of existing merit-based protections and expressing concerns about the potential for increased politicization of the civil service. It argues against the removal of employee protections and emphasizes the need for accountability and due process."
