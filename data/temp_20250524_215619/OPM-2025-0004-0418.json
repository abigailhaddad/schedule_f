    "key_quote": "The proposed change will endanger us in a variety of ways, including our current health and well being, as well as our future health and well being (the impact on science will be tremendously negative if unqualified individuals are allowed to lead scientific agencies).",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the importance of a merit-based system, and the potential negative impacts on scientific integrity and institutional knowledge. It emphasizes the need for civil service independence from the executive branch, which aligns with opposition to the rule."
