By reclassifying positions into a newly defined 'policy-influencing' category and removing core procedural protections, the rule could render veterans ineligible for the job stability and advancement opportunities they were led to expect.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, the potential for politicization, and the impact on public trust, particularly for veterans. These themes align with a strong opposition to the rule."
