    "key_quote": "The bottom line is: if you want honest opinions, if you want true accountability to the people (and not just to the president and his or her appointees) via transparency and the ability to speak truth to power \u2013 then respecting a certain level of independence within the professional career public service is essential.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed regulation, highlighting concerns about potential abuses, lack of accountability, and the undermining of civil service protections. It emphasizes the importance of independence in the public service and warns against politicization, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and due process."
