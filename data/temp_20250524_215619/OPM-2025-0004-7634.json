    "key_quote": "The proposed rule lays out a very dangerous plan that would politicize the civil service in a way that would undermine the work of the government.",
    "rationale": "The comment clearly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of the civil service, loss of institutional knowledge, and the importance of maintaining a merit-based system. The emphasis on the need for an apolitical civil service and the critique of the rule's justification further solidify its opposition."
