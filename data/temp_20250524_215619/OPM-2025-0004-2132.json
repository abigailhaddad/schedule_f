    "key_quote": "I strongly oppose this change as this reclassification of over 50,000 federal workers would leave so many essential federal workers in extremely vulnerable positions to be fired for political reasons.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the vulnerability of federal workers to political firings and the erosion of trust in government. It emphasizes the importance of non-partisan roles and the need for a supportive work environment, which aligns with themes of merit-based systems and due process."
