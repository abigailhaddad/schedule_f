    "key_quote": "This in turn allows for GREATER politicization of the positions rather than reducing it, as the employees would be immediately responsible to the political regime du jour, rather than to the Constitution or to the purpose of the agency for which they work.",
    "rationale": "The comment clearly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about increased politicization and the undermining of constitutional responsibilities, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and due process."
