    "key_quote": "First, the Rule seems to be unlawful. It conflicts with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d), so the proposed rule exceeds the President\u2019s statutory authority.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about its legality and the potential for abuse in determining employee misconduct and performance. This aligns with themes of protecting merit-based systems and due process rights."
