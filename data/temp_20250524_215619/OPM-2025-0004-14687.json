    "key_quote": "For a President to single-handedly decide that a group of Federal employees in policy-influencing positions should be done away with *because of the specific positions they hold* is not only not within his scope legally, it's a transparent play to get rid of people the President perceives as a threat to his bid for total power.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the legality and potential politicization of the civil service, emphasizing the need for accountability and checks and balances in government."
