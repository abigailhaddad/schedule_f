    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong concerns about the influence of political appointees on scientific grantmaking, indicating a belief that this would harm scientific progress and disrupt the integrity of the scientific process. This aligns with opposition to the proposed rule, which could lead to increased politicization of civil service roles."
