    "key_quote": "If civil service is increasingly subject to the pleasure (read: whims) of whomever is in office, then civil service will have too much turnover to be effective.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of experienced civil servants and the risks of politicization, which would undermine the integrity and effectiveness of the civil service. It raises concerns about due process and the potential for increased turnover and legal issues, aligning with themes of merit-based systems and employee rights."
