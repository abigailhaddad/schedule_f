    "key_quote": "Making scientific leaders at NIH political appointees, characterizing them as policymaking positions is detrimental to the mission of the NIH, and threatens the health and economic bases on which our nation depends.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concern about the politicization of scientific leadership, indicating opposition to the proposed rule that would allow for political appointments in positions traditionally held by career civil servants. This aligns with a defense of scientific integrity and the importance of keeping politics out of the grant-making process."
