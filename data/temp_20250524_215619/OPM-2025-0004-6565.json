    "key_quote": "If the real intent is to improve performance and conduct and to eliminate corruption -- as opposed to the opposite: corrupt retribution and retaliation to advance the parochial interests of the Chief Executive -- then shouldn't Inspector Generals, whose statutory role is oversight and who have a degree of independence from the Chief Executive, be best suited to neutrally and objectively identify poor performance and/or misconduct as part of their agency audits?",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, lack of due process, and the integrity of the merit-based system. It questions the motivations behind the rule and emphasizes the potential for corrupt practices, which aligns with a stance against the rule."
