    "key_quote": "I oppose the reinstatement of Schedule F, Docket (OPM-2025-0004), 2025-06904. Changing positions to \"at will\" sets a precedent for political appointees that will be severely underqualified and will undermine various federal laws set in place to protect the American people.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the reinstatement of Schedule F and raises concerns about the implications of politicizing federal positions, which aligns with themes of merit-based systems and due process protections."
