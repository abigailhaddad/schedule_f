    "key_quote": "In short, this rule is a solution in search of a problem. It would politicize the civil service, compromise the independence of expert professionals, and move the federal workforce dangerously close to a loyalty-based system that rewards obedience over competence.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its potential to undermine merit-based employment and due process protections, while also expressing concerns about the politicization of the civil service. The emphasis on maintaining integrity and nonpartisan governance further supports the classification as 'Against'."
