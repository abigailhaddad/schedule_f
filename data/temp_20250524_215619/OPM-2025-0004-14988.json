    "key_quote": "Under the guise that the proposed rule provides 'flexibility to expeditiously remove poorly performing employees' it is simply instituting a loyalty test and will remove the ability to voice valuable critical debate on any policy decision that is supported by the current administration.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the erosion of merit-based systems, and the potential loss of due process for employees. It emphasizes the importance of critical debate and the dangers of loyalty tests, which align with the themes of opposition."
