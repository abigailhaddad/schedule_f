      "Merit-based system concerns",
      "Due process/employee rights",

    ],
    "key_quote": "This NPRM doesn\u2019t improve government. It makes it less stable, less effective, and more vulnerable to partisan abuse.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about destabilizing government operations, undermining nonpartisan service, and the potential for arbitrary firings based on political loyalty rather than performance. It emphasizes the importance of civil service protections and accountability, which aligns with a stance against the proposed reclassification."
