    "key_quote": "This rule would muzzle the most experienced civil servants and turn them into little more than yes men giving cover to the administration's ideas, regardless of their relative merits.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concern that the proposed rule would undermine the ability of career civil servants to provide honest and critical feedback, which aligns with themes of politicization and the importance of a merit-based system. It highlights the potential negative consequences of discouraging employees from raising legal or operational concerns, indicating opposition to the rule."
