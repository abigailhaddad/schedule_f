    "key_quote": "Efforts to politicize the employees of government agencies by making them all political appointees will tend to make government inefficient and ineffective because a high rate of turnover replaces experienced and dedicated workers free of political interest into more politically attuned and ideologically driven people instead of devoted public servants of the public interest.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the politicization of government employees, highlighting concerns about inefficiency and the loss of experienced workers, which aligns with themes opposing the proposed rule."
