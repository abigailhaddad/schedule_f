    "key_quote": "I strongly oppose any effort to implement Schedule F or analogous policies such as the proposed P/C classification. This approach undermines the fundamental principles of the federal civil service, which is intended to be apolitical, merit-based, and protected from political interference.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the implementation of Schedule F, emphasizing the importance of a merit-based, apolitical civil service and the dangers of politicization. It raises concerns about due process and the integrity of the federal workforce, aligning with themes of opposition to the proposed rule."
