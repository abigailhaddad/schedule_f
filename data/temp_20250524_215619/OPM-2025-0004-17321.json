      "Merit-based system concerns",

    "key_quote": "Civil servants are expected to remain neutral, professional, and loyal to the Constitution and the rule of law \u2014 not to any individual leader.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of nonpartisan civil service and expressing concerns about politicization and the erosion of public trust in government. It highlights the role of civil servants as neutral implementers of laws rather than political appointees, which aligns with the themes of merit-based systems and due process."
