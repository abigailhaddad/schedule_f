    "key_quote": "If this rule passes, they\u2019ll be able to fire people just because they don\u2019t like someone\u2019s opinion. And don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s not what this is about. I know how these things work. It\u2019s a way to make sure folks don\u2019t push back against the political bosses, and that\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to be.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about the loss of experienced workers, potential politicization of the civil service, and the undermining of due process rights. The emphasis on protecting merit-based employment and the integrity of scientific research further supports the classification as 'Against'."
