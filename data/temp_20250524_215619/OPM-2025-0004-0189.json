      "Merit-based system concerns",

    "key_quote": "I do not support changing Federal workers into at-will employees. I think it is a poorly thought out idea that will destroy our American services and hurt ALL Americans.",
    "rationale": "The comment clearly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the negative impact of politicizing federal jobs and the importance of maintaining a consistent, merit-based civil service. It raises concerns about fairness, employee rights, and the potential for politicization, which aligns with the indicators for opposition."
