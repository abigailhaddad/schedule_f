    "key_quote": "This reclassification could lead to politicizing our federal statistical workforce. Imagine if Bureau of Labor Statistics leaders could be fired simply for releasing job or inflation numbers that don't match a President's talking points.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong concerns about the potential for politicization of federal statistical agencies and the loss of protections for civil servants, which aligns with opposition to the proposed rule. It emphasizes the importance of integrity and nonpartisan governance in the context of federal statistics."
