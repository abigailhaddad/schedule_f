    "key_quote": "By allowing heads of institutes, along with other officials, at the National Institutes of Health and other government institutions that distribute federal funds to be filled by political appointees, this policy would lead to federal funding not being granted to science with the most merit and potential to help Americans, but to scientists who are willing to advance a political agenda which may not have any scientific merit.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization and the potential harm to the merit-based system in scientific funding, indicating a clear stance against the rule."
