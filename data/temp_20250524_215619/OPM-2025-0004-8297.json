    "key_quote": "This re-categorizing is clearly due to the current administrations paranoia, a general abuse of power to only focus on loyalists, and a degrading act to the current innocent, hard working, non-partisan civil servants in an effort to target a specific few who have been disloyal in the eyes of the current administration.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about politicization, the targeting of non-partisan civil servants, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge. It emphasizes the importance of merit-based systems and due process, indicating a clear stance against the rule."
