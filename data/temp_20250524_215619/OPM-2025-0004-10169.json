    "key_quote": "This Proposed Rule threatens that foundation. By expanding the ease with which federal employees can be disciplined or dismissed and by weakening due process protections, OPM opens the door for political interference in what should be evidence-based governance.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, highlighting concerns about due process, politicization of civil service, and the importance of maintaining a merit-based system. The author emphasizes the negative impact on public trust and institutional knowledge, which aligns with a strong opposition to the rule."
