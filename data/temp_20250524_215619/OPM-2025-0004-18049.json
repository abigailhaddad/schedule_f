    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career of civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in federally funded science, and reduce our ability or identify future cures and treat existing illnesses that have or will impact every single American, regardless of political ideology.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concerns about the politicization of the NIH and its impact on public trust in science, which aligns with opposition to the proposed rule. It emphasizes the importance of nonpartisan governance in scientific endeavors."
