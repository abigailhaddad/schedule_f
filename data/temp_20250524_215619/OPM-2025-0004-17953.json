    "key_quote": "Do not reclassify career civil service employees to schedule F; I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures, and treat existing illnesses that have or will impact every single American, regardless of political ideology.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the reclassification of career civil service employees, citing concerns about politicization and its negative impact on public trust in science, which aligns with themes opposing the proposed rule."
