    "key_quote": "Introducing political instability through Schedule F would: \u2022 Undermine the merit-based grant review process at NIH, including NEI; \u2022 Threaten evidence-based policymaking in public health and scientific agencies; \u2022 Disrupt career pathways for young scientists entering government service; \u2022 Cause significant staff attrition and institutional knowledge loss at federal agencies.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the integrity of scientific research, and the potential loss of merit-based systems and due process protections for federal employees."
