    "key_quote": "The goal of Schedule F is simple: to replace functional governance with performative obedience. It is not reform. It is regression. It is not patriotic. It is plutocratic. And it is un-American.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization, the undermining of merit-based civil service, and the threat to constitutional principles. The language used indicates a clear stance against the rule, emphasizing the dangers it poses to governance and democracy."
