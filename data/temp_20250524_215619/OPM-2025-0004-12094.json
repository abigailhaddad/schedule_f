    "key_quote": "If civil servants were hired not based primarily on expertise, their work would not be done correctly and timely. Better ways of doing the work would not be found if civil servants feared they would be disciplined for offering professional opinions that administration leaders did not like.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, emphasizing the importance of hiring based on expertise and the potential negative impact on work quality and timeliness due to fear of political repercussions. This aligns with concerns about merit-based systems and the politicization of civil service."
