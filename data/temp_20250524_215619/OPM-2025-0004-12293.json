    "key_quote": "This rule is not a benign administrative adjustment\u2014it is a blatant power grab that authorizes the President and political appointees to summarily remove career federal employees in policy-adjacent roles without cause, without process, and without regard for the constitutional and statutory protections that have long undergirded the merit-based civil service system.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its potential to undermine the nonpartisan nature of the civil service and due process protections, indicating a clear stance against politicization and in favor of maintaining merit-based systems."
