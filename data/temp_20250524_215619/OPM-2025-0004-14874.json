    "key_quote": "In sum, I believe that the Proposed Rule should be rejected outright, for two main reasons: (1) it undermines the well-being and job security of a class of government professionals whose competence, conduct, and loyalty to 'the democratic process' have never been questioned, through a long succession of Democrat and Republican presidents, until now, by the Trump administration; and (2) it will have (at best) harmful and (at worst) an irreversibly damaging effect on the well-being of America and the American people as it undermines the stabilizing influence of a nonpartisan civil service that is crucial to our national governance.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about undermining civil service protections, politicization, and the potential negative impact on governance. The themes of merit-based systems and due process are strongly emphasized, indicating a clear opposition to the rule."
