    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing its potential to re-politicize the civil service and undermine the non-partisan nature established by civil service law. It highlights concerns about the loss of merit-based hiring and the negative impact on federal efficiency, which aligns with the themes of politicization and merit-based system concerns."
