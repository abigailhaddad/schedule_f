    "key_quote": "I feel that reclassifying the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH or any other agency that funds research that may fall under this reclassification now or in the future.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concern that reclassifying civil service employees would lead to politicization of agencies like the NIH, which directly opposes the intended goals of the proposed rule. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining public trust in federally-funded science, indicating a strong opposition to the rule."
