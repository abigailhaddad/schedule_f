    "key_quote": "To remove these protections would make them subject to the same political winds that swing the pendulum of congress and the presidency back and forth, bringing more chaos and uncertainty to an already precarious system.",
    "rationale": "The comment clearly opposes the rule by emphasizing the importance of civil service protections and the potential for politicization and unfair treatment of federal employees. It highlights concerns about due process and the merit-based system, indicating a strong opposition to the proposed changes."
