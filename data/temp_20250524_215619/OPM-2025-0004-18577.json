    "key_quote": "Implementing Schedule F will burn down the civil service system. Trump\u2019s plan will cause us to lose scientific knowledge, program design and implementation by forcing career employees to choose between being fired and serving Trump\u2019s authoritarian agenda.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of civil service protections, merit-based employment, and the dangers of politicization, particularly under the Trump administration. It expresses concerns about the potential loss of scientific integrity and the coercive environment that Schedule F would create."
