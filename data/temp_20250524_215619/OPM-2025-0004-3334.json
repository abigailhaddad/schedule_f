    "key_quote": "The proposed rule\u2019s resistance to define which specific positions\u2014or attributes thereof\u2014would categorize these positions as 'policy-influencing' to be moved to Schedule F leaves room for vast inconsistencies in the rule\u2019s application across government agencies and removes guardrails for accountability.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule due to concerns about the lack of clear definitions and the potential for politicization and arbitrary firings, which undermines merit-based systems and employee rights."
