    "key_quote": "The proposed regulation will greatly weaken the American research enterprise. By removing scientific leaders and experts and placing 'drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients' at the discretion of political appointees, the proposed regulation will destroy the excellence of American science.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about the reintroduction of a spoils system, the removal of due process protections, and the potential for politicization of civil service roles, particularly in scientific research."
