    "key_quote": "This proposal is a blatant attempt to stack the federal government with MAGA loyalists and gut the independent civil service in which I proudly worked for over thirty years.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of the civil service, the erosion of due process rights for employees, and the undermining of a merit-based system. The explicit mention of 'MAGA loyalists' and the potential for widespread firings without due process indicates a clear opposition to the rule."
