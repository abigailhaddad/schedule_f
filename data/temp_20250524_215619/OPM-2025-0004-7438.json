    "key_quote": "\"The proposed rule is legally vulnerable on multiple fronts: 1. It conflicts with statutory rights under Title 5. 2. It potentially violates due process protections under the Constitution. 3. It exceeds OPM\u2019s statutory authority and is ultra vires. 4. It threatens the integrity of the merit-based civil service.\"",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting its legal deficiencies, including conflicts with existing statutory protections and constitutional due process, which indicates a strong stance against the rule's implementation."
