    "key_quote": "Removing these protections, particularly for so-called 'policy-influencing' positions, would dangerously politicize what should be impartial work and undermine the integrity and effectiveness of government decision-making.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of civil service protections for maintaining nonpartisan governance and preventing politicization of the civil service. It highlights concerns about due process, merit-based systems, and the potential loss of institutional knowledge, all of which align with opposition to the rule."
