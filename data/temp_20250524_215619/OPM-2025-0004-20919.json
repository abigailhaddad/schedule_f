    "key_quote": "Federal workers have job security precisely because they need to be non-partisan. Those who remain in Federal service for their careers work for several Presidents, typically of both parties. They work for WE THE PEOPLE, not whoever is President at the time.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of non-partisanship and job security for federal workers, which aligns with concerns about politicization and the loss of institutional knowledge. The critical tone towards the proposal and the call to maintain the current system further indicate opposition."
