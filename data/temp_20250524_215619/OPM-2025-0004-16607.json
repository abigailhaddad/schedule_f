    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the rule by highlighting concerns about the replacement of career civil servants with political appointees, which undermines merit-based systems and institutional knowledge. It also raises issues of bureaucratic efficiency and the risks of politicization, aligning with themes that oppose the proposed rule."
