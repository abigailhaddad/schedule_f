    "key_quote": "Giving the administration power to politicize career appointments is unconstitutional - it undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act and is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the implementation of Schedule F, citing concerns about politicization, constitutional violations, and the undermining of merit-based civil service protections."
