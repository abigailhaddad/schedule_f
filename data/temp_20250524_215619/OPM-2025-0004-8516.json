    "key_quote": "I oppose this proposed rule in its entirety, and every section of the proposed rule, because it allows any given Administration to replace the nation's professional cadre of policy experts who serve the Constitution with individuals whose primary loyalty is not to the Constitution and the law, but rather to partisan politics and powerful individuals.",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule, citing concerns about politicization of civil service and the erosion of due process rights for federal employees. It emphasizes the importance of loyalty to the Constitution over partisan interests, aligning with themes of merit-based systems and employee rights."
