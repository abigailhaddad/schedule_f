    "key_quote": "Instead of converting this number of federal employees into political employees, please consider reforming how employee reviews, disciplinary actions and terminations are currently handled under civil service procedures and federal employee unions.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a non-partisan civil service and the historical context of moving away from political patronage. It advocates for reforming existing processes rather than implementing a system that could politicize federal employees."
