    "key_quote": "I urge you to withdraw the proposal to create an excepted-service category (\u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d) that would reclassify hundreds of competitive-service positions as at-will. This change would strip front-line federal employees of long-standing due-process rights, open the door to politicized dismissals, and ultimately undermine the impartial delivery of critical services.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of due-process rights, the potential for politicization of dismissals, and the negative impact on the integrity of federal services, which aligns with the indicators of opposition."
