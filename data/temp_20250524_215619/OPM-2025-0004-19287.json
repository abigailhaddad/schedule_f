    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F would politicize the NIH, reduce public trust in Federally-funded science, and reduce our ability to identify future cures for diseases that impact all Americans, regardless of political ideology.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about politicization of the NIH and the potential negative impact on scientific integrity and public trust, which aligns with themes opposing the rule."
