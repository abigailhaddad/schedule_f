    "key_quote": "This regulation undermines those principles by suggesting that civil servants are employees of the president rather than servants of the Constitution.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of civil service protections, the nonpartisan nature of federal employees, and the potential for politicization and loss of integrity in government. It raises concerns about accountability and the role of civil servants, which aligns with a defense of the current merit-based system."
