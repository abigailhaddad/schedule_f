    "key_quote": "Civil servants should be confident that their knowledge and expertise will be respected, regardless of who is \"in charge\" - those elected to public office or appointed by elected officials know nothing of how agencies operate and should not have control over hiring and firings.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses strong opposition to the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of respecting civil servants' expertise and the need for proper procedures in employee termination, which aligns with concerns about politicization and due process."
