    "key_quote": "By converting them to at-will employees, we will lose that stable workforce, as they are pushed out to seek more stable employment in the wider market.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of career civil servants and their expertise, which would be undermined by politicization and the removal of due process protections. The concerns about losing stability and institutional knowledge further align with a defense of the current merit-based system."
