    "key_quote": "Making it so that policy is always political is criminal. It goes against the constitution, and it is a smack in the face for hardworking US citizens - allowing their federal workers to be replaced at the whim of the executive branch so that they can better control the government.",
    "rationale": "The comment strongly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of nonpartisan loyalty and the constitutional role of federal civil servants, indicating concerns about politicization and undermining of ethical standards."
