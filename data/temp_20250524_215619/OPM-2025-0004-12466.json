    "key_quote": "This rule is clearly meant to be yet another means of applying pressure, reeling a federal agency in further under the direct control of our current executive, and undermining structures meant to keep critical government work from going undone because everyone without a figurative Ph.D in boot-licking has been fired.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses significant concerns about the potential for politicization of civil service and the erosion of merit-based protections, indicating opposition to the proposed rule. It questions the definitions of misconduct and poor performance, highlighting fears of arbitrary removals that undermine democratic processes."
