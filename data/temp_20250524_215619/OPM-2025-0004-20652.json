    "key_quote": "I believe the reclassification of the career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee the review of grant applications as Schedule F has the risk of politicizing the NIH, reducing public trust in Federally-funded science, and impact the pace and ability to identify future cures for diseases that impact all Americans.",
    "rationale": "The comment expresses concerns about the potential politicization of the NIH and its impact on public trust and scientific integrity, which aligns with opposition to the proposed rule."
