    "key_quote": "Changing the status of federal employees, who receive civil protection, into at-will-employees will reduce the stability of the federal civil service, turn over decades of experience as civil servants leave for more reliable work, and encourage a workplace culture of nepotism over the current merit based system.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about the erosion of civil service protections, the potential for nepotism, and the negative impact on the quality of work and public confidence. These themes align with a defense of the current merit-based system and due process rights."
