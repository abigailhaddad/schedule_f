    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of hiring civil servants based on merit and experience, and it expresses concerns about politicization and the potential loss of institutional knowledge. The overall tone and content reflect a strong defense of the current merit-based system and civil service protections."
