    "key_quote": "If we don\u2019t have a civil service talented in more than being loyal to the billionaires in the Trump regime, how are such blessings of the collective to be administered?",
    "rationale": "The comment explicitly opposes the proposed rule by emphasizing the importance of a professional civil service and expressing concerns about politicization and loyalty to political interests over public service. It also references human rights and the need for government to protect citizens, which aligns with merit-based and due process concerns."
