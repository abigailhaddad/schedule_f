    "key_quote": "The main reasoning the Trump admin has given for this change is that it resolves a current issue with the federal workforce of being unable to fire people who ought to be fired for poor performance and the like. While this is understandable as a reason, that reasoning is clearly untrue; OPM-2025-0004 would be ineffective at doing that.",
    "rationale": "The comment opposes the proposed rule by highlighting concerns about its effectiveness and potential negative impacts on the federal workforce, including the politicization of civil service and loss of institutional knowledge."
