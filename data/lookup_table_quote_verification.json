This rule threatens to damage scientific progress and the standing the US has as the leader in innovation in science and technology. Only experts in each field can discern the value of a proposed project. When I serve on NSF panel I draw on the full extent of my expertise in my sub-field to evaluate whether a proposed project is scientifically sound, whether it fills an actual need in the field, the degree to which it will contribute valuable outcomes for public interest, and whether the team is sufficiently prepared to carry out the proposed project. Such reviews depend on the leadership of career program officers and their deep expertise in each subfield to navigate debates about these issues. Science, engineering, technology, and education must be free of political influence and laser focused on the merit of each proposal as a contribution to innovation to maintain our standing as the world's leader in research and development and...",

The rule, if finalized, would inflict serious harm on career civil servants in at least the following ten ways:\n\nI. Elimination of Due Process Rights\nThe proposed rule exempts Schedule Policy/Career employees from Chapter 75 and Chapter 43 procedural protections (5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7512, 4303)\u200b.

We instituted a fair system of hiring the best qualified individuals regardless of their political affiliation.  The current Administration wants to eliminate that system and replace it with an antiquated system of appointing \"loyal\" workers into our federal workforce.  In the meantime, they want to eliminate the protections afforded under the current system.  All of this strikes me as unfair, backwards, and subject to political influence.  We can't continue to dismantle our government and make it less efficient, more likely to be politically influenced and less likely to be populated with workers who are experts in their jobs.

This ensures that science can reveal objective truths that are based on data without fear of political interference or bias. This objectivity also is essential for building and maintaining public trust. It has allowed scientists and science as a whole to innovate and develop new technologies and cures unforeseen even a few years ago.

This is a barely disguised attempt to politicize the federal workforce and force federal employees to put loyalty to the President above adherence to law and the Constitution, and above the best interests of the country and public they serve. Federal employees are politically neutral public servants. They are not an extension of the executive branch of government. This proposed regulation seeks to reshape the federal workforce into a tool of the President\u2019s, instead of as the valuable civil service it\u2019s been for decades. It is summarily wrong to equate unwillingness to implement unjust, illegal, or otherwise harmful policy with misconduct or poor performance when it is exactly the opposite. Federal workers who refuse to comply with corrupt and lawless practices are doing exactly what they should be doing and should not be penalized for it. This is such a blatant attempt to expand executive power and push our country..",

The politics of patronage may work for the wealthy and the elite, but normal Americans need government administrators and workers who will do their jobs as required by law regardless of which party occupies the executive branch. If there are issues with how these jobs are being performed or defined, beyond anything that might be handled by internal human resources such as chronic tardiness or harassment, then that can be addressed through legislation from Congress. Far from seeking improved \"performance,\" this rule will plainly be used to further politicize what should be apolitical.

The Civil Service Reform Act promises that federal employees will be \u201cprotected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes.\u201d The proposed policy suggests that the Trump administration will welcome principled disagreement that help to craft better policies. However, it is clear that this administration make clear the Policy/Career Schedule will be used in ways that increase politicization while undermining the conditions of good administration. A series of abuses have occurred, and contrary to the promise of the proposed rule, OPM has not stepped in to resolve politicization.\n\nThe selection of political appointees and the gross negligence in hiring qualified candidates could not be more clear than the recent appointment of the DHS head of Terrorism Prevention.

By reclassifying approximately 50,000 positions into Schedule P/C, the proposed rule would allow these employees to be dismissed without cause or due process, effectively politicizing roles that have traditionally been nonpartisan. This shift threatens to erode the foundational principles of a merit-based civil service. \nThe reclassification to at-will status removes critical protections that shield federal employees from political retaliation. Without the ability to appeal adverse actions, employees may be vulnerable to dismissal based on political considerations rather than performance. This environment could discourage employees from providing candid advice or whistleblowing, undermining the checks and balances essential to effective governance. \nThe proposed rule raises questions about its...",
