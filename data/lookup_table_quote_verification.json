The Trump administration has so far done a terrible job at appointing people with actual experience and qualifications in their fields. For example, RFK Jr, Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, Matt Gaetz, etc. Trump appointees in the field of science would likely also be unqualified (lacking degrees in basic science, publications, leadership, editorial work, speaking appointments, teaching, lab research, or mentorship.) For any other job this would be considered unacceptable but it is especially dangerous in science, a field that pushes humanity forward by providing lifesaving care and world-enriching discoveries. \n\n-A concerned American citizen and neuroscience staff at Princeton University",
