   LLM Rationale: The comment discusses the challenges of filling political appointee positions but does not explicitly support or oppose the proposed rule. It focuses on the operational issues within government agencies without addressing the implications of the proposed rule on civil service protections or politicization.
   Text: I am commenting on the proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management Docket ID OPM-2025-0004

Currently the Federal Government employs 2.5 to 3 million civilian personnel.  Of these, only about 4,000 are political appointees.

   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the proposed rule by expressing a desire for accountability and the removal of abusive civil servants, indicating a belief that the current system fails to address misconduct.
   Text: I want to detail my experience working under abusive civil servants at NASA. I worked for NASA Goddard 553 and during that time I was harassed by a civil servant who wanted to "abuse contractors," because of my major depressive condition.

   Text: I have such mixed feelings.  On one hand I personally have seen employees use EEO/DEI as a weapon against being held accountable or drive people who try to hold them accountable or are not liberal out of government.  On the other hand, I don't know how government is effective if positions become politicized and flip every 4 years.

   Text: If you guys want to destroy the federal workforce then just do it already. Stop playing around with these nonsensical regulations and proposals. We can see through the writing on what you actually want to do. Heck I could've done a better job doing what you wanted to do at a cheaper, faster and less intrusive basis.

   Text: I would like to see the research and studies that support this decision over continued use of executive orders.

   Text: As a retired Federal employee, I understand the need to improve perforance, accountability and responsiveness. I have seen management having to go through a long laborious process to remove an employee for unacceptable performance.

   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the proposed rule, arguing for accountability in federal employment and suggesting that current civil service protections hinder the ability to remove underperforming employees.
   Text: I am a Fed and I support this rule. As Federal employees we answer to the American people, and that means we have to report to the President and his agency heads. The current system makes it almost impossible to fire tenured Feds, and that is a problem if America is supposed to be a democracy with government by consent of the governed.

   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the idea that the current civil service system makes it difficult to remove poor performers, aligning with the goals of Schedule F to address this issue. The author emphasizes the need for efficiency and accountability in federal employment.
   Text: I am a current Federal employee, with more than three years of Federal service. I just want whoever is reading these comments to know that the discussion about how hard it is to fire poor performers is entirely correct. One of the things you realize when you become a Federal employee is that some employees have "retired in place."

As a prior Federal Employe Employee, I agree with the reasoning and legal support provided in this proposal. 

During my ~30 years of service, I found that organizations tended to follow their own direction when the leaders did not agree with elected officials and there was little to no accountability when they followed their own direction.

   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports actions that would reduce the influence of unelected bureaucrats, aligning with the proposed rule's intent to allow for easier removal of federal employees in policy-influencing positions.
   Text: I’m passing along my comments on this proposed rule based on my 40 years of federal government service for the HEW/HHS OPDIVs: SSA, OFA, OCSE, FSA, ACF, HCFA, and CMS. I had the opportunity to gain experience in fifteen job classification series while serving at these agencies.  During the earlier years of my career the agencies were solely interested in serving the American citizens, the latter was all about management building personal empires.

The mention of the current civil service system being a 'mess' further indicates a desire for change that the proposed rule would facilitate.
   Text: I support this proposal. I have worked several years in the Federal government, in a component excluded from chapter 75 and where security clearances are required for most jobs.

   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the implementation of Schedule F, arguing that it is necessary for accountability and oversight of federal employees. The author expresses a belief that the current civil service system is outdated and abused, which aligns with the rule's goals.
   Text: This is very interesting. Every comment I browsed, maybe 20+, was against this regulation. And every comment except one, played the anti Trump, DOGE and Musk cards. This, alone, makes me think that Schedule F implementation is necessary. Something’s amiss here.

   Key Quote: "Given the substantial implications of these changes—for employee rights, agency operations, and the merit-based foundations of the civil service—it is critical that stakeholders have adequate time to analyze the proposal and submit meaningful comments."
   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily requests an extension of the public comment period without explicitly supporting or opposing the proposed rule. It emphasizes the need for thorough analysis and input, which does not indicate a clear stance on the rule itself.
   Text: I write to respectfully request that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) extend the public comment period for the above-referenced proposed rule for an additional 30 days, for a total of at least 60 days.

The proposed rule seeks to fundamentally restructure the accountability framework for career civil servants in policy-influencing roles by creating a new “Schedule Policy/Career” in the excepted service. The rule would remove these positions from the procedural protections of 5 U.S.C. cha...

As an engaged citizen with direct experience in rule-making, I have no predisposed stance on the Schedule F proposal. To evaluate its legality, scope, and practical effects, I respectfully request detailed information on the rule’s design, implementation, and oversight. The following questions are intended to elicit clear, specific explanations that will inform a thorough legal analysis.

It focuses on the need for cost calculations related to recruitment and retention, which does not align with the themes of support or opposition.
   Text: In Section D. Costs on page 17219, OPM states that implementing Schedule Policy/Career would not affect agency recruitment and retention efforts. Doing so also assumes that the likelihood of being fired under Schedule Policy/Career is identical to the current system - otherwise, pay would need to increase to attract employees and offset the reduced job protections. Because OPM does not propose a pay increase, OPM needs to assume that recruitment and retention will be unchanged.

   LLM Rationale: The comment supports the idea that public servants should follow orders without exercising personal political preferences, aligning with the proposed rule's intent to streamline accountability and remove employees who do not comply with directives.
   Text: When you are a public servant in a position where you are obligated to follow orders or direction from your superiors, you do not have the right to exercise your own political or cultural preferences in doing your job. For example, if a warrant for someone's arrest is sworn, signed by a judge and given to a policeman to make the arrest, the policeman's job is to serve that warrant and make that arrest. If the policeman believes that the person he is to arrest is innocent, he may not take it upon...

   Text: I have worked as an NSF and NIH funded researcher for 40 years.  I wholeheartedly agree with the president’s plan to redefine certain positions as presidential appointees.

Re: Docket ID: OPM–2025–0004

Grant-making is crucial to the strengthening of science by allowing experts to research new and innovative life-saving technologies, science, and medicine. As scientists who base research rooted in the scientific method, the nature of science is non-partisan and requires qualified experts to review and lead grant decisions that best serve the American public through their work.

   LLM Rationale: The comment expresses a general concern about government workers and economic inequality but does not directly address the proposed rule or its implications for civil service protections or politicization.
   Text: Our government workers are for essential services to our country and not surplus . They do jobs that help the middle class and lower class and children! 
    Cutting money so the rich have more is only for the rich! It’s the rich who should be helping the middle class and poor since we are the workers of this country!

   Key Quote: "I believe in the description "public servant" when it comes to our elected officials and the people they pick to help them in our government."
   LLM Rationale: The comment expresses a general belief in the concept of public service and loyalty to the USA, but it does not explicitly support or oppose the proposed rule regarding Schedule F. It lacks specific references to civil service protections or the implications of the rule.
   Text: I believe in the description "public servant" when it comes to our elected officials and the people they pick to help them in our government. We, as a people, hire them--not any single person. They are truly servant leaders--leading all of us to form a more perfect union so that the United States of America is and will be a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom.  Their loyalty is to no one person or group but to the USA.

   Key Quote: "Such behavior undermines democracy, as it enables government power to be wielded without accountability to the voters or their elected representatives."
   LLM Rationale: The comment supports the proposed rule by arguing that career federal employees misuse their positions for personal political agendas, which the commenter believes undermines democracy and accountability. This aligns with the rule's intent to enhance accountability and align federal employees with the elected President's agenda.
   Text: As discussed in greater detail later in this proposed rulemaking, it is well documented that many career federal employees use their positions to advance their personal political or policy preferences instead of implementing the elected President's agenda. Such behavior undermines democracy, as it enables government power to be wielded without accountability to the voters or their elected representatives.

   Text: Thank you for bringing these unaccountable “civil servants” to heel. One quick glance at any of the places that these supposedly “nonpartisan” employees gather (such as /r/fednews) makes it immediately clear that they do NOT share the can-do attitude and scrappy work ethic that the men who built this country embody.

   LLM Rationale: The comment expresses strong support for significant cuts to the federal government, implying a belief that federal employees should not have protections against layoffs. This aligns with the efficiency goals of the proposed rule.
   Text: Our federal government is a bloated, wasteful, repetitive ponzi scheme. Why should federal employees get to avoid layoffs all other employment sectors have been hit with over the last decade? Honestly the cuts are not nearly deep enough. The entire federal government needs to be slashed by a minimum of 1/3,with a goal slashing 1/2.

   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports increasing accountability for career employees, suggesting that it is necessary for the country's best interest, which aligns with the goals of the proposed rule.
   Text: Increasing accountability for career employees in the civil service will be in the best interest of this country. Career employees rely too much on their years of service for job security. Employee misconduct is often overlooked. The government should be able to hold career employees accountable for any misconduct.

I strongly support this Proposed Rule, if it is enacted as actually described and not simply as a cover to eliminate or gap additional positions.

   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily consists of questions seeking clarification and information about the proposed Schedule F regulation, without expressing a clear stance for or against it. The themes of scientific integrity and politicization are present, but the overall intent remains neutral.
   Text: I have several questions about how the proposed Schedule F regulation would impact the integrity and effectiveness of federal agencies, particularly those involved in science grantmaking, such as the NIH if numerous government jobs are reclassified as “policymaking positions” subject to presidential appointment and removal.
What is the evidence that supports schedule F will result in better management of grantmaking processes?
Concerning the NIH, scientific grants are awarded on merit and soundn...

   Key Quote: "On page 17220, OPM should provide estimated appeal costs if an employee files an EEO complaint."
   LLM Rationale: The comment is a request for information regarding estimated appeal costs related to EEO complaints and does not express a clear stance for or against the proposed rule.
   Text: On page 17220, OPM should provide estimated appeal costs if an employee files an EEO complaint. Then, OPM can provide an upper bound estimate of the costs (or reduced savings) by assuming that all future dismissals are routed through EEO to resolve disputes.

   Key Quote: "Recommend OPM cite data detailing the number of MSPB appeals in a given year to provide the reader with context and know whether this assumption is reasonable."
   LLM Rationale: The comment requests additional information and context regarding MSPB appeals without expressing a clear stance for or against the proposed rule. It focuses on data transparency rather than the implications of the rule itself.
   Text: When discussing MSPB appeals, OPM "assumes that one-quarter of those [112] separations would have otherwise resulted in initial MSPB appeals, or 28 in total (pg. 17220)." Recommend OPM cite data detailing the number of MSPB appeals in a given year to provide the reader with context and know whether this assumption is reasonable. 

If this information is unavailable, recommend providing a range of estimated appeal percentages, along with their associated costs.

   LLM Rationale: The comment does not explicitly support or oppose the proposed rule; instead, it calls for a thorough evaluation process before any terminations, which does not directly address the themes of civil service protections or politicization.
   Text: Before humans are terminated from their jobs, an appropriate evaluation needs to be done to find out what each department does and how it overlaps and effects other functions.

   Text: Have supervisors spend at least 30% of their working hours performing the same work as the employees they supervise.  Too many supervisors spend their time attending unnecessary meetings, performing administrative tasks far below their pay grade (e.g., approving leave requests, unnecessary micro-management), and generally doing non-productive that does not further legally required workloads.
