   Text sample: I am in complete opposition to this proposed regulation for “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil  Service “ (Regulation) submitted by the Office of Management and Budget under the Trump Administration.
The federal civil service system , which is based on merit, was established by The Pendleton Act ( Act) of 1863. This Act was in response to the ineffectiveness and inefficiencies of the “Spoils System “ in which federal employment was based upon political loyalties or personal relationships. Career Civil Servants were further protected by enactment of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, which stated that removal actions must be for merit-based reasons and not inappropriate causes, such as whistleblowing. Furthermore, under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the concerns that the merit-based civil service rules impeded agencies’ abilities to effectively manage employees and remove poor performance were addressed. 
This proposed Regulation is simply a ploy to...

   Text sample: I strongly object to the proposed Schedule F regulation. Reclassifying NIH grantmaking roles as "policymaking positions" subject to political appointment risks severely damaging the integrity of federal science funding.
 
Politicizing leadership positions like Institute and Center Directors would undermine merit-based grant decisions, increase disruptive turnover, and jeopardize long-term research planning. Scientific expertise, not political considerations, should guide the allocation of federal research funds.
 
Schedule F threatens to erode the scientific integrity of agencies like NIH, hindering progress and undermining public trust in science. I urge the exclusion of these critical science-related roles from this regulation.

"are required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the President. Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal."

It also states that:

And "guidance about positions agencies should consider in their Schedule Policy/Career positions" includes those with:

"Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions."

   Text sample: I have serious concerns with the implications of this new regulation that would institute Schedule F, specifically as it relates to grantmaking. I refute the policy's language that "grantmaking is an important form of policymaking." In our society, grantmaking is merit-based and is meant to solve a demonstrable problem to improve the lives of citizens. It is not, and should not, be an instrument used for the implementation of any policy handed down from government. Reclassifying government jobs as policymaking positions risks serious waste in a few major forms: (i) time-consuming waste dealing with the turnover of positions with each new administration wanting to install their own picks for these positions; (ii) waste of investment as new administrations cancel existing federal funding however they deem fit based on whether it serves their policies; and (iii) research workforce erosion as investigators lose faith in the stability of federal grants with the change in policies from...

If passed, this regulation would return us to a spoils system, in violation of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. This act was passed to rid us of the corruption rampant in the executive branch of government during the Gilded Age and was a direct response to the assassination of President Garfield, who was shot by a disappointed donor promised an ambassadorship. The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act ensured that the hiring and promotion in the executive branch of the government is based on merit; it also ensures stability in our federal government as hirings are non-partisan and not based on loyalty or patronage to any specific politician. 

Additionally, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F...

   Text sample: I am writing to express my concern over OPM-2025-0004, or as it is rather deceptively called "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service." The concern, it seems, is that Civil Service employees are not subject to the vagaries of hiring and firing suffered by "at will" employees.  This is a feature, not a bug. It is designed to ensure continuity of service in essential government functions, giving the taxpayers confidence that the services for which they pay will be effectively administered.  The introduction of a "Schedule F" status strikes at the root of government stability.

We have already seen the abuse of probationary status for employees with less experience across the board of taxpayer facing services, leading to longer hold times with services that citizens actually use, delays in getting Social Security, failures of aid to reach people experiencing disasters, and a general reduction in overall reliability.

   Text sample: As a current federal employee and PMF alumni, I can say this move is not wise. The original intent of the EO that started this process listed numerous positions that could qualify under this new codification of the rule. Contracting in particular is at great risk. The FAR indicates that the contracting officer has independence in the contracting process. Also, it prevents supervisors from ordering contracting officers to sign contracts that they do not agree with. This new provision of "schedule F" or "Policy/Career" is not going to help out the government. Employees will be afraid to be independent or speak out if in policy roles. This is crucial to the enforcement of the intent of congressional and presidential policies. There are other ways than using this new authority to achieve that goal. The use of political positions is better suited to achieving the directive desired here. Please do not lump in supervisors, contracting staff, anyone who touches policy, etc, that is in the...

   Text sample: Legislation is often difficult to understand for people without legal training. However the following statement stands out:"These positions will remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis. Yet they will be at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals." The experience in other democracies is that even when there is a drastic change in administration, it's precisely the civil service that keeps the government's functions running. Somehow "career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis" and "at-will positions" is kind of an oxymoron. Keep these positions out of the reach of politicians please.

   Text sample: A bedrock principle of our republic is a professional and nonpartisan civil service, a system carefully constructed on merit since the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883. The proposed "Schedule F" classification poses a significant threat to this enduring foundation. By potentially allowing the reclassification and dismissal without cause of a broad spectrum of career civil servants, particularly those engaged in crucial policy formulation and analysis, this initiative opens a dangerous pathway for political considerations to unduly influence hiring and firing decisions. This directly contravenes the spirit and letter of 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which clearly mandates that federal employment decisions must be rooted in merit-based principles, shielded from the vagaries of political influence.

Furthermore, the imprecise and expansive criteria for inclusion under "Schedule F" raise serious concerns regarding the fundamental due process protections currently afforded to career federal...

   Text sample: I am writing to express my strongest opposition to the Office of Personnel Management's proposed rule implementing Executive Order 14171, which would create a new "Schedule Policy/Career" in the excepted service and remove procedural protections and appeal rights for employees designated as occupying "policy-influencing" positions.

This proposed rule would significantly disrupt the functioning and effectiveness of the federal government in several critical ways:
1.	Compromising the Merit System and Operational Continuity: The proposed changes undermine foundational merit principles while threatening the professional, non-partisan civil service that ensures continuity across administrations. Career civil servants with institutional knowledge are essential for maintaining operations during transitions of power.

   Text sample: The proposed “Schedule Policy/Career” classification would be a disastrous policy to implement.By allowing political leadership to reclassify large numbers of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy development or analysis—this measure would remove critical job protections and expose federal employees to politically motivated hiring and firing. Career civil servants take an oath to serve the public in a nonpartisan way. 
Federal jobs should be awarded based on merit, not political allegiance. Civil servants are hired for their expertise, and they’re protected from being fired without cause—so they can give honest advice and keep government running smoothly through political transitions.
The “Schedule Policy/Career” classification would reverse that progress. It would let agencies reclassify civil servants in policy-related roles, removing due process protections and turning them into at-will employees. In practical terms, that means thousands of experts could be...

   Text sample: Dear Director Ahuja:

I write to raise serious concerns with the cost-benefit analysis accompanying OPM’s proposed rule to establish “Schedule Policy/Career” in the excepted service. While this rule has been designated a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866, its accompanying cost-benefit analysis does not meet the standards required for such actions. The analysis suffers from speculative assumptions, methodological gaps, and an absence of empirical support for projected benefits.

1. Unbalanced and Speculative Benefit Estimates
The proposal suggests that the primary benefits of the rule stem from "increased accountability" and faster rulemaking due to improved employee performance. However, OPM acknowledges that it "does not have a reasonable basis for estimating the magnitude of these gains" and therefore does not quantify them​. These unquantified benefits are described as likely to “vastly outweigh” any administrative cost savings—yet no data or modeling is...

   Text sample: I am writing to express my concern over OPM-2025-0004, or as it is deceptively called "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service." The concern, it seems, is that Civil Service employees are not subject to the vagaries of hiring and firing suffered by "at will" employees.  This is a feature, not a bug. It is designed to ensure continuity of service in essential government functions, giving the taxpayers confidence that the services for which they pay will be effectively administered.  The introduction of a "Schedule F" status strikes at the root of government stability.

We have already seen the abuse of probationary status for employees with less experience across the board of taxpayer facing services, leading to longer hold times with services that citizens actually use, delays in getting Social Security, failures of aid to reach people experiencing disasters, and a general reduction in overall reliability.

   Text sample: Schedule F (now revived as **Schedule Policy/Career**) is problematic for several key reasons:

---

 **Threat to Merit-Based Civil Service**
- **Breaks from over a century of merit protections** dating back to the Pendleton Act (1883).
- Enables **removal without cause or appeal**, weakening job security for career officials.
- Risks turning a nonpartisan workforce into one more vulnerable to **political influence or loyalty tests**.

---

 **Politicization of Career Roles**
- Although described as “nonpartisan,” Schedule F allows agencies to fire employees without following traditional due process.
- Critics fear it **opens the door to partisan purges**, especially in agencies that regulate politically sensitive issues.
- Potential for **ideological litmus tests** in hiring/firing decisions—favoring loyalty over expertise or independence.

   Text sample: The rule of law is the cornerstone of the US system.

Our founders designed the system to ensure we did not have rule by any single body or person. The organization of government that we have had since the Pendleton Act was passed in 1883, has helped to ensure our democracy is of, by, and for the people, and not for any single person. To engage schedule F would turn our merit system, which has worked for 150 years to ensure a professional and well functioning government, into a morass of incompetence, corruption, and ineptitude. The American people deserve better. They deserve administration of policies and programs that is as far removed from partisan politics as humanly possible. Schedule F as described here is Orwellian.

I worked under 6 presidents, both Democrat and Republican. In 31 years of service, I never once learned or discussed any of my colleagues' political parties or views. We are professionals, experts in our fields, hired to provide advice, recommendations, background, based on our years of experience and training. By politicizing the civil service, you will not get unfiltered advice. I did not always agree with the final policy but I ALWAYS IMPLEMENTED IT. I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution and I never wavered from that. This is a terrible idea, a step toward autocracy.

   Text sample: Executive Order 13957 outlines a process for revoking civil service protections for certain federal workers who traditionally discharge their responsibilities consistent with the priorities of the administration in office.

The proposed rule claims that employees in this category will not have to “personally or politically support the president.” However, that assertion seems dubious. Just last week, the Office of Special Counsel, an independent watchdog agency whose previous head was fired by Trump in February, reinstated a 2020 advisory opinion that allows civil servants to wear or display swag (like a MAGA hat) overtly supportive of an incumbent officeholder, while continuing to prohibit such partisan displays on behalf of candidates for office - a distinction that is overtly in opposition of the Hatch Act. Moreover, Trump has shown little tolerance for any hint of political disloyalty, hesitation about policy agendas, or questioning of legality of administration actions. Trump...

These are important people they know where things are and how to get them done. They are the core of the government.

Political appointees are subject to the directives/whims of the current administration, whatever party it might be... and these directives/whims come and go while good science, law, and other critical work depend on stability and focus over time. Accountability in the civil service already exists, as well as mechanisms to ensure performance. The past few weeks of the current administration have already made abundantly clear the damage that can be done to essential public services by political appointees who lack the requisite knowledge and depth of experience to make decisions in the best interest of the American people.

As a retired federal employee, I know how changes in political appointees leading a department or agency can disrupt ongoing priorities. That was before all the unqualified appointees of the current administration were sworn in. Making significantly more positions accountable to the sitting president would cause chaos, as highly qualified, knowledgeable and experienced employees are replaced by people off the street with no knowledge or experience. Agencies will become much less capable of meeting their missions. This will result in financial loss to the government as well. Civil service policies must remain merit based and not sabotaged as this proposed regulation would do.

 Titled; Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service would be a huge mistake.  
As proposed the rule would significantly reduce the quality of our government workforce by making civil service positions more difficult to fill with qualified, dedicated public servants. Our nation faces many complex, difficult problems which requires day-to-day management by individuals with significant expertise. The proposed changes would make it more difficult to compete for talented people who would have little job security.  This competition would require higher salaries to attract the same level of talent.  
An alternative response from the US government would be to settle for less qualified personnel within their available salary structure.  This situation plays out in many states were government employees are poorly paid.  Such...

   Text sample: I have worked in the military (RA Officer: Infantry, Chemical Corps; in command and R&D positions), the federal government (Chemist, GS-12), and private industry (Environmental and Power Engineer positions) and have seen all 3 systems up close: Military, Federal, Private Industry. Many of the most outstanding people I worked with were federal employees.

Of all three areas, I saw dedicated, competent personnel, and some who were incompetent as well, but the worst area was the private sector, by far, where nepotism and favoritism ran wild. The myth that Federal workers are slackers, unnecessary, unworthy of professional respect, etc., should be exploded and put to rest; it is a story made up by anti-government politicians and ignorant voters who have singularly narrow, uninformed views, possibly based on their contact in one-on-one situations in their own town offices, people they helped to place in their positions. They know nothing of the wider government, except that they don't...

   Text sample: Reinstating **Schedule F** is an outright declaration of war on the **nonpartisan integrity of the U.S. civil service**. It would obliterate the merit-based protections that have long shielded federal employees from political coercion, and replace them with a system where **loyalty to a political leader trumps competence, experience, and the rule of law**.

Schedule F was originally designed to reclassify tens of thousands of career federal employees—especially those in policy-related or advisory roles—as *at-will employees*, stripping them of due process protections and making them vulnerable to **arbitrary firing and political purges**. This effectively turns what should be a stable, professional civil service into a patronage system—exactly what the **Pendleton Act of 1883** was passed to prevent after the rampant corruption of the spoils system in the 19th century.

If reinstated, Schedule F would:

* Allow any administration to **sweep out career experts** and install loyalists...

   Comment IDs: OPM-2025-0004-12361
   Text sample: As a retired employee with 30+ years of experience in federal government, I strongly oppose this proposed rule.

The rationale for the rule is that many in federal service believe that it is too difficult to fire underperforming employees.  Further, there are multiple examples of employees, regardless of competence, opposing or resisting the implementation of policies determined by an Administration with no consequence.

As I understand it, the proposed solution to these problems is to create a new class of excepted service employees, mostly consisting of employees involuntarily classified from competitive positions.  These reclassified employees would not be provided any means of challenging their reclassification and could be fired at will from their new positions.  This problem is compounded by the considerable discretion that agencies are given in determining the particular positions that are subject to reclassification.

A central reason for having a meritocractic civil service...

As an employee of the federal government, my comment is from a personal level.  I strongly object to introducing or reviving the "Schedule F" classification for federal workers. This plan jeopardizes the civil service system's foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit. Notably, President Trump has supported this merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which aimed to end the spoils system and ensure hiring and promotion based on merit.
I disagree with the conclusion that employees who faithfully perform their jobs to the best of their ability have little to fear from Schedule Policy/Career. The order expressly prohibits discrimination based on political affiliation, and agencies have strong incentives not...

   Text sample: To Whom it must concern:
There is a pernicious idea in the administration that must be checked.  that is the notion that government service will be better by having more political appointees in supervisory positions.
That would be a return to the old patronage system, very inefficient and open to corruption, as we already see that Mr Young of Musks company has a severe conflict of interest, running the consumer financial protection bureau into the ground while also serving as  musk supervisor in businesses that are regulated by government mandate.

Do not use the so-called schedule F as Mr Trump proposes. Our civil servants deserve protection from arbitrary political whims about DEI and "wokeness".

   Text sample: During my time working in the federal government, I observed 100’s of my fellow workers striving to accomplish the agency mission without regard to their party affiliation or their personal political philosophy. Although I was friendly with many supervisors, I never observed nor heard of a supervisor frustrated by the inability to fire an underperforming employee. Supervisors presently have adequate authority to address underperforming employees.

Enabling the firing of employees “for poor performance or misconduct, such as corruption or for injecting partisanship into the performance of their official duties.” will inject partisanship into the federal workforce.

The rationale for this rule is bogus and the impact will decrease the effectiveness of the federal workforce. It will amplify the problem that it claims to address.

   Text sample: I oppose the reimplementation of Schedule F as proposed in Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service."

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and other science based agencies . These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System, National Parks and other public lands and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the USFWS Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would...

   Text sample: I oppose politicizing the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from many thousands of dedicated public servants, as proposed in the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service." 
Federal employees are and should remain committed to the missions of the agencies through which they serve the American citizens and should be loyal to the Constitution, not to any individual person or political party.
This proposed change will erode American’s trust in the government. It will also result in a less efficient government. OPM should provide an analysis of how this will impact agency staffing in terms of retention, costs, and recruitment.

   Text sample: I whole-heartedly agree with the great Republican President Theodore Roosevelt that "what you know, not who you know" should determine who gets a government job. This rule change would return the U.S. to the political "spoils" system that Teddy Roosevelt fought to replace with the merit-based systems we have now. President Trump did not campaign on making these drastic changes to the century-old approach to staffing the federal government. Making such a fundamental change without Congressional (or voter) approval is executive over-reach. I am familiar with our nation's science agencies where federal positions are highly competitive "dream jobs" that one aims to achieve after many years of education and training in science. The premise of this rule change does not align with my experience with federal scientists and other science agency professionals. I do not believe this proposed rule change would address the identified problem of removing poor performers. It would only serve to...

   Text sample: I am opposed to this proposed change. Reclassifying federal employees as “Schedule F” violates the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, captured in 5 U.S. Code § 2301 and 5 U.S.C. § 7513. The CSRA was established to fairly and equitable govern civil service and established a merit system and its principles. Civil servants work for, and on behalf of, the American people and need to place the well-being of our nation first.  They are being paid by the American people and their service is to them and not an individual, political party or political agency.  

Expanding Schedule F will most likely place thousands of civil services into bondage to a set of politicians and would remove the necessary protections from reprisals due to perceived disloyalty. As a result, reclassified employees will face the choice of continuing to serve the American people or performing as beholden servants of a specific set of politicians or parties. 

This proposal will compromise the ability of civil service...

Comment Opposing OPM Proposed Rule OPM-2025-0004-0001: Constitutional, Statutory, and
Doctrinal Objections
I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw its proposed rule to create a “Schedule Policy/Career” classification
and alter removal protections for federal employees. The proposal is unconstitutional, ultra vires, and
incompatible with Congressional intent, established statute, and controlling precedent.
1. ⁠Separation of Powers and Congressional Prerogative Congress has exclusive constitutional authority
to structure the civil service and establish removal protections. See U.S. Const. art. I, §8; Myers v. United
States, 272 U.S. 52, 123 (1926); Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 627–29 (1935);

Subject: Comment on Proposed Rule – Opposition to Schedule F (Docket No. OPM-2025-0004)

To Whom It May Concern:

I am submitting this comment in response to the Office of Personnel Management’s proposed rule, Docket No. OPM-2025-0004, published in the Federal Register on April 23, 2025. I am a federal civilian employee working in contracting and acquisition for a major Department of Defense agency, and I strongly oppose any attempt to reinstate or expand the Schedule F excepted service category.

Reintroducing Schedule F is like putting lipstick on a pig. No amount of rebranding—“modernization,” “efficiency,” or “accountability”—can hide the fact that this proposal is an effort to erode the core merit principles of the civil service. Schedule F would give political appointees broad authority to reclassify and remove career employees without due process, threatening the stability, neutrality, and institutional expertise that are vital to good...

   Text sample: By reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, Schedule F would do away with merit principles and add up to 50,000 appointees from the current 4000.It's a terrible idea and one that all Americans should oppose. Civil servants are already accountable in several ways, and research tells us that politicizing public service leads less honest communication from appointees, more ideologically radical appointees, greater turnover in the workforce, and - as a result - to riskier and lower value outcomes and increased inefficiency and waste. It would harm scientific research and policy making, including medical, safety, and defense programs. It would allow elected officials to do away with the best research from the most qualified people, subject to rigorous peer review and public scrutiny, and replace it with something close to a politburo. In short it's not only a terrible idea; it's antithetical to better and less wasteful government - and moreover completely un-American.

Not only did he use the app but he used it to discuss confedential information.  He has no background for his position and his appointment to it is completely without merit.  It's unfortunate that his existence continues to be a national security risk that is not being addressed.

   Text sample: Docket (OPM-2025-0004)
The proposed "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" is ill-conceived. In my 30-year experience working for the Federal Government, I witnessed that employees who did not perform according to the evaluation criteria were given feedback on how to improve their performance, including taking additional training, coaching, and frequent feedback from their supervisors. If the support provided did not result in improved performance, the employee was terminated. In some cases, an employee was terminated for blatant poor performance, or misconduct, after receiving reasons for the termination. Therefore, it is unlikely that Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct. 

However, what is happening now across Federal Agencies is NOT providing steps for Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service. Instead, skilled, expert, scientific employees can...

1- Lacks clear definition of what constitutes a "policy-influencing position," creating potential for arbitrary application and undermining fair enforcement. 

2 - Duplicates existing accountability mechanisms without first evaluating their effectiveness. The Senior Executive Service (SES) already provides a framework for leadership accountability that balances administrative priorities with institutional continuity.

3 - Threatens government functionality by politicizing a traditionally nonpartisan workforce. This undermines the institutional knowledge essential for consistent service delivery through administrative transitions.

   Text sample: As a longtime federal employee, who wishes to remain anonymous lest I be unfairly branded as a “rogue” or “disloyal” employee just for raising concerns, I believe that the Proposed Rule is too vague, which is going to lead to issues both foreseeable and unforeseeable. There is significant vagueness in its key terminology, which creates substantial problems.

The rule seeks to address situations where employees "undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives." However, the meaning of this phrase is highly unclear.
What actions constitute "subverting" a directive? Does it include:
Disagreeing with the directive's policy implications?
Offering alternative interpretations of the directive's language?
Raising concerns about the directive's legality or feasibility?
Implementing the directive in a way that, while technically compliant, differs from a supervisor's expectations?

The term "intentionally" also raises questions. How is "intent" to be...

   Text sample: The proposed rule will lead to significant monetary costs for the government, contrary to its intention. These costs merit more serious contention. 
First, there will be increased litigation costs. There has already been a demonstrable increase in litigation costs due to other Executive Orders and proposed changes to federal civil service. Consider this tracker: https://www.justsecurity.org/107087/tracker-litigation-legal-challenges-trump-administration/. This is costing the American taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars, whether or not the Acting Director of OPM thinks otherwise. It is clear no real analysis of the cost has been performed.

The so-called “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” proposal simply changes the previous “Schedule F” classification into the “Schedule Policy/Career” classification that still threatens the merit-based civil service system that has served as the foundation of our nonpartisan federal workforce.

“Schedule Policy/Career” classification still undermines the basic core tenants of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. The whole point of that Act was designed to eliminate the spoils system that historically plagued this nation. In place of the spoils system, we got a merit-based hiring process that is no longer marred by partisanship. By allowing thousands...

   Text sample: Subject: Opposition to Proposed Rule RIN 3206-AO80 – Risks Politicizing Civil Service
Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004

To the Office of Personnel Management,

I strongly oppose proposed rule RIN 3206-AO80 (90 FR 17182). Creating "Schedule Policy/Career" to make "policy-influencing positions" at-will, thereby removing adverse action procedures and appeal rights, is a detrimental step for our civil service. It threatens the integrity, effectiveness, and non-partisan nature of federal employment. While "increasing career employee accountability" is a stated goal, this rule is a disproportionate and dangerous solution. It will inevitably lead to the politicization of vital government roles, the erosion of merit system principles, and the undermining of impartial administration of laws and regulations.
This rule directly attacks the foundational merit principles of our civil service, established by the Pendleton Act to protect against political coercion. By making "policy-influencing" roles...

More importantly, it is a dangerous politicization of career civil service positiions that have nothing to do with political policu making. It ignores the need for apolitical professional skill needs and will have the effect of reducing prompt, fair and objective service needs to the American public.

   Text sample: I would like register my opposition to the proposal that NIH Institute and Center Directors become classified as polymaking positions and therefore be political appointees. I am a scientist and assure you that nearly all of what the institute directors do is scientific. What is the most effective way to find better treatments for failing kidneys? Weaving together to the thousands of on-going studies, spanning arcane molecular theory to clinical cases, requires diligence, experience, and training. While it is true that what a director decides as the most effective way to move forward can be considered a 'policy' but this policy emerges from scientific analysis. Diseases are not Democratic or Republican. Fighting deseases requires all hands on deck. Please leave politics where it belongs, in Congress. Thank you.

The sciences should not be part of politics. Health care is too important for everyone to have NIH Institute Directors and Center Directors became political appointees. Their job is to keep their respective institute or center running smoothly. Politics has nothing to do with it and could endanger future health research and innovation. We already have examples of particular branches of health research being eliminated or restricted. This will have a devastating impact on the everyday lives of Americans. The NIH Directors and Center Directors need to be free of political interference to make sure Americans get the benefits of health research they deserve. 

The same is true of NSF and their Division Directors. While NSF funds basic science and not health research, their role in funding a wide range of science from...

Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions."

   Text sample: As a concerned citizen, I adamantly oppose the proposed changes that would weaken the competitive employment and firing rules for career federal employees. These rules ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on ability, not politics. Undermining this system will again politicize the civil service, threatening to knock us backwards from the neutrality and professionalism that now characterize the civil service and are essential for a well-functioning government to the graft and favoritism our current rules put an end to.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability,  continuity and expertise across changing administrations. They are not political appointees—they are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Allowing broader reasons for dismissal and making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals will erode public trust and damage the ability of government to provide...

One of the things you realize when you become a Federal employee is that some employees have "retired in place." They are continuing to collect their full salary but aren't doing much to advance the mission and aren't putting in any noticeable effort. In some cases they just don't work at all. Something that was great about telework was these employees just stayed at home and didn't do anything. Now that everyone has to come into the office full-time you have to work with them directly. Except they aren't doing anything more than the bare minimum, and often enough not even that.

I, Terry Shen, submit these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Proposed

2. I know from my professional experience as a civil servant that the proposed rule would cause
inconsistencies in the exper0se of the federal employees. Furthermore, if civil servants were
hired not based primarily on exper0se the func0ons of our government will be degraded. And

According to the Congressional Research Service,* this proposed rule could reclassify approximately 11,910 senior-level DOD employees — including 3,300 from the Army, 3,112 from the Navy, 1,592 from the Air Force, and 3,906 from other DOD entities — as at-will political appointees. Many affected individuals occupy GS-14/15 positions, equating in responsibility and authority to O-6 military ranks (Colonel or Navy Captain). These civilian leaders are indispensable to strategic planning, weapons systems acquisition,...

     I write to express strong opposition to the Proposed Rule.  This rule is nothing more than a return to the 'spoils system'  As a former career federal investigator, I can only imagine how this rule would have a chilling effect on fair and impartial actions throughout government service.
     It would be very easy for future civil servants to be hired not based primarily on expertise, but on loyalty to a specific president or agency head.  The pet friend of the supervisor could be retained while other dedicated employees would be released.  Imagine the chilling decrease in expertise and efficiency if an entire group of employees were released because a new president was elected.  There would be a loss of experienced employees and dedication if employees had to 'look over their shoulder out of fear they would be disciplined for voicing...

   Text sample: As a concerned citizen and former federal employee, I strongly oppose the proposal to convert protected career civil servants to “at will” employees. 

I practiced law in both the private and federal sectors for almost 40 years.  While in government, I served with undoubtedly the most talented, smartest, and ethical colleagues imaginable.    Not so much the rotating political appointees, hired on the basis of donor status, party participation and/or personal loyalty,…. riding the coattails of their benefactors, but with no expertise, understanding of government or sense of accountability.   The temporary status of an appointee simply does not engender the dedication or sense of mission that career civil servants internalize.   Indeed, the protections afforded career civil servants enable them to perform reliably, professionally, without regard to personal political favor regardless of who holds the White House.  Loosening the criteria for civil servants’ dismissal and replacement by...

   Text sample: I am strongly against the proposed rule change. Reclassifying these employees is both alarming and dangerous. This will enable whoever is in power— people in power now as well as those in power in the future— to get rid of civil servants without cause and due process. Reclassifying a broad category of federal employees is a cover for being able to fire employees for political reasons. This has nothing to do with accountability or responsiveness. This change threatens science and the Heath and wellness of the American people.

I STRONGlY urge the rejection of this rule change.

   Text sample: I’ve proudly served under three presidential administrations, delivering consistent support to colleagues and the American public—regardless of political leadership. That’s only possible because of a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service. It ensures that federal employees are selected for their qualifications, not their political affiliations, and that essential government services are delivered fairly, reliably, and in compliance with federal law.

Implementing Schedule F would undermine these principles. It would expose career civil servants to political pressure, destabilize operations, and reduce the government’s ability to fulfill statutory mandates such as the 21st Century IDEA, the Government Performance and Results Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. Furthermore, it contradicts the Office of Personnel Management’s statutory obligation under 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to uphold the merit system and protect against politically motivated employment actions.

   Text sample: I am strongly opposed to the rule proposed by the Personnel Management Office [the Proposed Rule] on 04/23/25 with the misleading title: "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" (Office of Personnel Management 5 CFR Parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, and 752 [Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004] RIN 3206-AO80).

I write based on my experience of over 32 years working as an analyst and advisor for the US Environmental Protection Agency. In those years I have seen the dedication and hard work of my fellow employees as we endeavored to scrupulously follow the laws enacted by Congress. I have also seen bad results when political appointees were more interested in currying favor with the then-current administration than in following the rule of law.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed changes regarding the hiring rules for career federal employees. Federal jobs should awarded based on merit, full stop. A person's political opinions or "loyalty" should not be taken into account. A politicized civil service has potentially catastrophic consequences, namely removing any functionality to our government.

Civil servants should not be under further pressure. They are already scrutinized far more than they deserve and are what makes our country function. These people are skilled, educated, and experienced in their roles and to have any of that change depending on who is in office is a slap in the face to not only anyone who has ever been a federal worker, but to our country itself.

I can't help but think of the potential damage that could be done to Americans if ideologies with no fact-based merit can shape federal policy. A government serves its citizens. All of its citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the...

   Text sample: Dear Madame and Sir,
I strongly oppose this rule.  I am a retired Federal employee who rose to the rank of the Senior Executive Service, having served for 21 years in the civil service system. I was awarded with this position because of my experience and expertise, as well as my loyalty to the Constitution of the United States and the agency in which I was employed.  Employees such as me gained valuable knowledge, expertise and experience regarding the workings of our agency and the policy issues that our agency was required to address.  I believe that such knowledge, expertise and experience  has proven invaluable to our agency's decision-making process.  Such knowledge and experience would be lost if this new rule is implemented, substituting instead via Schedule F a position- holder likely without such experience and expertise for addressing the matter at hand.

   Text sample: Comment on United States Office of Personnel Management Proposed rule Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 or RIN 3206-AO80

Creating a more effective and efficient government is among the most important issues facing the United States today. Executive Order 14171 of January 20, 2025, states “Accountability is essential for all Federal employees, but it is especially important for those who are in policy-influencing positions.”   There are several ways to help accomplish this goal. Increasing career employee accountability is a vital step in this process and yet the current proposed rule does not accomplish this goal. In fact, it makes it less likely. Thus the proposed rule should not be finalized or published. 
While there are several reasons that this is the case two merit closer consideration.
  
First, as denoted in Background Subsection B Executive Orders 13957, 14003, 14171, and the Prior OPM Rulemaking moving policy positions to the schedule policy/career will vitiate the ability of...

From "COVID’s body bags" to "preventable tornado and measles deaths", the evidence proves that replacing expertise with loyalty "kills Americans". Now, Project 2025", Trump’s far-right playbook—promises to finish the job by dismantling every check on his power. Here’s the horrifying record:  

1. COVID’s Mass Death Toll: A Direct Result of Trump’s Sabotage
"Firing the Pandemic Response Team (2018)": Trump "disbanded the CDC’s Global Health Security team" in 2018, leaving the U.S. unprepared for COVID. When the virus hit, "testing collapsed", PPE vanished, and "states competed for supplies like a Third World country".  
- Silencing Scientists: Trump "blocked CDC warnings", pressured the FDA to approve unsafe treatments, and "retaliated against whistleblowers" like Dr. Rick Bright (who warned of ventilator shortages).

   Text sample: I strongly object to the proposed Schedule F regulation. Reclassifying NIH grantmaking roles as "policymaking positions" subject to political appointment risks severely damaging the integrity of federal science funding.

Politicizing leadership positions like Institute and Center Directors would undermine merit-based grant decisions, increase disruptive turnover, and jeopardize long-term research planning. Scientific expertise, not political considerations, should guide the allocation of federal research funds.

Schedule F threatens to erode the scientific integrity of agencies like the NIH, hindering progress and undermining public trust in science. I urge you to exclude these critical science-related roles from this regulation.

I am in complete opposition to this proposed regulation for “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil  Service “ (Regulation) submitted by the Office of Management and Budget under the Trump Administration.
The federal civil service system , which is based on merit, was established by The Pendleton Act ( Act) of 1863. This Act was in response to the ineffectiveness and inefficiencies of the “Spoils System “ in which federal employment was based upon political loyalties or personal relationships. Career Civil Servants were further protected by enactment of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, which stated that removal actions must be for merit-based reasons and not inappropriate causes, such as whistleblowing. Furthermore, under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the concerns that the merit-based civil service rules impeded agencies’ abilities to effectively manage employees and remove poor performance were addressed.

   Text sample: As Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Neurology at UCLA, and as a member of the vision research community, consultant to the USPHS,  and a supporter of evidence-based public policy, I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule that would enable the reclassification of federal employees into a new Schedule F category. This is a terrible idea!

This proposed rule would severely jeopardize the integrity and continuity of scientific research across the federal government, including at the National Eye Institute (NEI), where apolitical, expert leadership is essential to advancing breakthroughs in vision science and protecting the eye health of millions of Americans. Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration...

   Text sample: I strongly object to the proposed Schedule F regulation. Reclassifying NIH grantmaking roles as "policymaking positions" subject to political appointment risks severely damaging the integrity of federal scientific research funding, one of America's most impressive areas of achievement. 
 
Politicizing leadership positions like Institute and Center Directors would undermine merit-based grant decisions, increase disruptive turnover, and jeopardize long-term research planning. Scientific expertise, not political considerations, should guide the allocation of federal research funds.
 
Schedule F threatens to erode the scientific integrity of agencies like NIH, hindering progress and undermining public trust in science. I urge the exclusion of these critical science-related roles from this regulation.

Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004
 Dear Office of Personnel Management: 
I, Lorraine Beahm Shipp, write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule.
I was employed at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington D.C. for 35 years.  I passed a Civil Service exam and was employed as a GS-2 Physical Science Technician. My employment was conditional for 3 years in which I acquired the technical skills and scientific knowledge needed to perform my job.  After the three years, my job was protected by the Merit System Protections Board which gave me the assurance that I could continue to support my family. 
Hiring government employees on the basis of knowledge and experience has produced the multi talented, disciplined cadre of employees that...

   Text sample: I am a civilian employee of the DEVCOM Chemical Biological Center and a paying member of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE). I'm interested in this rule because it directly affects the rights of myself and my coworkers, which I deeply care about.

I vehemently oppose this rule. It would take important rights away from civil servants, and due to the vague definition of "policy-influencing", it has the potential to affect every single civil servant in the United States.

This rule would hurt civil servants' freedom of speech because it would grant this administration (and any administration that proceeds it) the power to directly fire any civil servant simply for not pledging their loyalty to the administration. Civil servants fired in this way would be given no justification and no right to appeal.

This would also effectively eliminate whistleblower protections for civil servants. If you are a civil servant and decide to report a problem within your organization, the...

   Text sample: Overall, the proposed rule is a bad idea. It may improve organizational performance by making it easier to to get rid or poor performers, but it is just as likely that it will get rid of outstanding performers who have unconventional ideas: remember the Apple “think different” ad campaign. The most likely outcome reclassifying a large number positions as “at will” is a culture of caution and conformity—people at every level just doing what the boss wants. Note, numerous fatal airplane incidents have been caused by a co-pilot’s caution in challenging the pilot’s judgement until it it too late.

It makes a subtle switch from talking about policy-determining and policy-making to “policy-influencing.” Policy-influencing is an ill-defined and overly broad term. Almost anyone could be termed a policy influencer.

Here is an example: “Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding...

   Text sample: I strongly object to introducing or reviving the "Schedule F" classification for federal workers. Even if taken at face value, making it easier to fire civil servants INCREASES the risk of those positions becoming politicized and partisan, it does not reduce them. These federal agencies belong to US, the American people, they do vital work for us, and being able to hollow out these agencies is stealing vital expertise and services that rightfully belong to our citizens.
Furthermore, this administration has DEFINITELY not earned the trust to take their claims at face value, given the disingenuous and highly partisan attacks on goverment workers across multiple agencies.

This plan jeopardizes the civil service system's foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit. Notably, President Trump has supported this merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles...

   Text sample: Schedule F

I am writing to oppose Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) proposed by OPM, Docket ID (OPM-2025-0004), and RIN (3206-AO80). The roles presumed to be included in Schedule P/C should be filled by individuals appointed without political agenda. Decisions made in these roles should benefit all Americans and not only fulfill the whims of a political party (this can go both ways depending on the political party of the president). Ethics would be a bigger concern. If the large number of proposed Schedule P/C employees can be fired at will, these employees will feel pressure to make decisions based on political loyalty to keep their job and will not necessarily make balanced considerations to make policy to benefit all American citizens. Mass firings of the large number of proposed Schedule P/C employees between administrations will weaken government expertise needed for complex work, hinder efficiency, and in turn will weaken continuity and the delivery of public services.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the "Schedule F" classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.
First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly violates the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants, particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b) (8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and be free from political influence.

I'm borrowing this from another comment because they said it much better and with more detail than I can:

I strongly object to introducing or reviving the "Schedule F" classification for federal workers. This plan jeopardizes the civil service system's foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit. Notably, President Trump has supported this merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which aimed to end the spoils system and ensure hiring and promotion based on merit.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed Schedule F or "Schedule Policy/Career" rule. As a scientific researcher, I know that the proposed rule will seriously damage U.S. science and innovation. Scientists are needed to evaluate and make decisions regarding science, not political appointees. Scientists can implement less biased standards to support the integrity, credibility, and scientific rigorousness of federally-funded science. This leads to better science to help mankind and advance human knowledge. This would be hamstrung by replacing career scientists.

   Text sample: COMMENT ON PROPOSED RULE U.S. Office of Personnel Management “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 | RIN: 3206-AO80.
As a recipient of  NIH funding for over 10 years,  I am voicing my  comment in opposition to OPM’s proposed rule (5 CFR Parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, and 752; Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004; RIN 3206-AO80).
The proposed rule is overly broad, and includes civil servants who perform agency grantmaking:
“Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions.”
Reclassifying grant-making roles a means of “policy-making” would stifle...

   Text sample: As a retired federal employee I'm angered that the government wants to take away any grievance rights from any employee management or bargaining unit employees. Removing civil service protections from loyal hard working employees  is wrong. Protections from political interference is essential for the smooth operation of government agencies .   If one goes back to understand why the Pendelton  Civil Service Act was passed  after  President Garfield was shot the  leaders realized political pressures must be removed . This way civil servants could be kept free from political interference while performing their jobs.   Keep the civil service protections as they are now.   I remember how I was called into the office for something that I was charged with that happened on my day off. I had the right to a hearing , without any civil service protections employees would be thrown out with out ant rights.

   Text sample: The President's plan to implement Schedule F for civil servants in general and the NIH in particular is bad for the United States. 

The duties of civil servants should have a long time horizon. Retention of civil servants for their institutional knowledge, specialized expertise, and professionalism in the service of the United States is more valuable to the US taxpayer than allegiance to any political party or perceived indifference or even objection to the current administration. 

With regard to NIH, all Institute and Center Directors and their division directors and managers should be career civil servants and not become political appointees. In addition to politicizing the NIH, such a change would also increase the turnover of key positions, limiting longer-term planning and execution, increasing costs to the taxpayers and limiting what the NIH can achieve.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed Schedule F rule, now rebranded as “Schedule Policy/Career,” as outlined in the Office of Personnel Management's proposed rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.” As a physician-scientist with extensive experience, including investigator-initiated funding from the NIH and AHRQ and over 100 peer-reviewed publications, I am deeply concerned that this rule threatens the integrity of federally funded science and the nonpartisan civil service that underpins it.

Reclassifying tens of thousands of career federal employees into at-will positions without due process protections—particularly those involved in scientific research, grantmaking, and policy analysis—opens the door to politicization and ideological interference. Agencies like NIH, NSF, and AHRQ rely on impartial, expert staff to evaluate proposals and manage research funding based on scientific merit, not political loyalty. The proposed rule's vague...

   Text sample: I strongly opposed the proposed rule changes.  Civil servants should not be political appointees. In addition, the rule proposes to insert partisan influence into grantmaking processes: "Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions."  This will clearly lead to biases in what research is funded - thus completing undermining the objective process of conducting science. The fields of medicine and science cannot be driven by partisan decision making - these need to be driven by what is necessary for advancing human health REGARDLESS of the particular administration's agenda. Implementing such a biased...

   Text sample: Apologies if I am getting it wrong by labeling this "Agency," I am writing to comment on the proposed changes to the civil service. I strongly oppose altering these positions to fill them with political loyalists (I see what it says below, but the first 100 days and DOGE tell a different story, so I am working with your record rather than your rhetoric here). If we are to remain a small-d democracy this will make it much harder for any true representation of We, the People, to continue. It will just mean the definition of who counts as a person will shift every four years or so (assuming you will still be allowing free and fair elections at all, a thing of which I'm not longer sure). And when the pendulum swings left it will potentially decimate much of the work that has been and is being done.

   Text sample: I OPPOSE this. This will be abused to put in place political appointees that have an agenda unrelated to the mission of the department, such as public health at HHS. Career employees are difficult to fire for precisely this reason. They should not be easily removed because that opens the door for any new administration to put in place partisan, unqualified, greivance driven people. Further, many federal projects such as NIH grants or clinical trials, are for 5+ years, and thus continuity over the lifetime of the project is important. There should not be whiplash from administration to administration in these federal departments and organizations. Lastly, the record of this administration in firing federal employees has been abysmal. From experts that manage the nuclear arsenal, to firings at HHS of personnel that conduct ongoing clinical trials. Until a better track record in managing employment can be demonstrated, this administration should have LESS authority to remove anyone from...

It is a classification that will undermine the effectiveness of government agencies of due process among other important matters.  Maintaining a merit-based, nonpartisan and professional federal workforce insures a civil service that is based on merit and free from political influence.  Thank you for consideration of this important matter.

Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” Proposed Rule, 90
Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 Dear Office of Personnel Management:
I, Carol Goettl, submit these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Proposed
Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” 90 Fed. Reg.

time was as a Manager, Supervisor, and/or Administrator at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in a variety of different programs. During my tenure, I saw personally just

seniority ladder. It is critical that these...

Subject: Opposition to the Proposed Changes Regarding "Schedule Policy/Career" Employees

I respectfully submit the following comments opposing the proposed rule, which would significantly weaken essential civil service protections. The rule, if finalized, would inflict serious harm on career civil servants in at least the following ten ways:

I. Elimination of Due Process Rights
The proposed rule exempts Schedule Policy/Career employees from Chapter 75 and Chapter 43 procedural protections (5 U.S.C. §§ 7512, 4303)​. Employees could be removed without prior notice, meaningful explanation, or the opportunity for neutral third-party appeal. This violates fundamental tenets of procedural fairness and significantly deviates from longstanding civil service protections recognized by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.

I am a science researcher with more than 25 years of research experience conducting science funded by the NIH. My research helps to improve the lives of all Americans. My colleagues and I care deeply about the United States being a world leader in science and research. The science that we do is not red. It is not blue. It is red, white, and blue. It is for all Americans.
   One of the reasons why the United States is a current leader in science research is because the grant system in place utilizes expert scientists to evaluate the rigor and significance of a research grant. This allows the most significant and well conceived research projects to be funded and conducted.  The proposed changes in this document (notably https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-06904/p-158) to put grant decisions under Schedule F control would significantly decimate research in America.

   Text sample: The proposed rule, OPM-2025-0004, titled "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service," presents several significant deficiencies that are contrary to established legal principles, threaten the non-partisan nature of the civil service, and could ultimately harm everyday Americans.

1. Contrary to Law and Eroding Due Process: The rule proposes to move "policy-influencing positions" into a new "Schedule Policy/Career," making these career jobs at-will and exempting them from adverse action procedures and appeals under 5 U.S.C. Chapters 43 and 75. This stands in stark contrast to previous OPM interpretations, which clarified that "policy-influencing positions" were exclusively for political appointments and maintained robust appeal rights for career employees.

While the document argues that the President has statutory authority to exempt certain policy-influencing positions, the Supreme Court, in the 1970s, interpreted the Lloyd-La Follette Act as...

   Text sample: My salary as a researcher at an R1 public university is 100% dependent on soft money. Right now, 100% of that comes from NIH. I had just barely made it as an independent scientist in 2024 (received my first solo R01) and am submitting 3 R01s this cycle. I also review for NIH, twice already this year. 

We need unbiased, clear and transparent standards for science and for funding science. Otherwise, no one knows who to believe or what to believe. We are currently living through this, as none of us are clear on current priorities (on paper and practice) and it’s making it so much harder to write grants. If we replace career experts with political loyalists, how do we trust that standards and practices won’t change wildly with each election cycle, which is far shorter than the 5-year R01 cycle (or the 2-5 years it takes to repeatedly submit, improve, and recieve the r01).

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule OPM-2025-0004-0001, which aims to codify the "Schedule Policy/Career" classification, previously referred to as Schedule F. This proposal poses significant risks to the integrity, independence, and effectiveness of the federal civil service.

We have and will continue to serve any administration and maintain our oath to the U.S. taxpayer to carry out the law and regulations to our fullest abilities. We may personally disagree with something that the administration has decided to do, but we continue to implement their will no matter what. No one I've ever worked with would do anything different at any level in the agencies I worked with.

Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,”
Proposed Rule, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, RIN: 3206-AO80
I am a federal employee submitting this comment in my personal capacity about OPM’s
proposed rule, “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil
Service.” This rule would politicize the civil service and allow hiring based on partisan
loyalty rather than objective qualifications. A merit-based, non-partisan civil service is a
cornerstone of a healthy democracy. Politicizing the civil service erodes its e(cid:431)ectiveness
and undermines its ability recruit and retain qualified individuals. It would also be an
improper exercise of Executive Branch power, unduly infringing on powers granted to
Congress by the Constitution.

This change is unnecessary and obviously meant to cause greater changes in our government with a new administration. To align what needs a to be a competent worker for a loyal employee, catering to the whims of our latest president. Given that the current policy is that a promoted employee and a new hire are both subject to termination without appeal, the ability of the government to control their employees and their quality seem to be though enough. Perhaps even too absolute given the recent firings in various departments, that led to the required rehiring of critical employees to their positions. Such as are nuclear safety workers, or perhaps the layoffs in HHS that in court have been shown to be devastating. This is can not be overstated, our center for disease control has laid off workers during a potential outbreak of bird flu, even just among livestock. In the...

   Text sample: I write to express opposition to the proposed rule. 
The proposed rule titled “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” (90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004) raises significant concerns about undermining the integrity and independence of the federal civil service. By easing the process for removing federal employees and expanding the use of term appointments, this rule risks politicizing the workforce and diminishing the protections that ensure public servants can perform their duties without fear of retaliation or political pressure. The merit-based system, a cornerstone of federal employment, is designed to promote stability, institutional knowledge, and nonpartisan service. Weakening these safeguards would not only reduce employee morale and job security but could also lead to a decline in the quality and continuity of public service delivery.
Furthermore, the rule’s emphasis on expedited removals under the guise of improving...

   Text sample: I write to express my strong opposition to the proposed rules changes to Schedule F. 
Schedule F is a plan that would result in the reclassification of thousands of government jobs as “policymaking positions”.  This change would subject these positions to presidential appointment.  This action would also require the removal of the government employees who occupy these positions. 

This regulation would reclassify jobs that once fell under civil service protection which require that such jobs be filled on the basis of expertise and experience. In the case of the National Institutes of Health, this is clearly a critical requirement for the scientific leadership of this organization. 

The language in the proposal that is of concern is this: "Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant...

   Text sample: To the Office of Personnel Management,
I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule, "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service," as published in the Federal Register (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, RIN 3206-AO80).
As a dedicated federal employee with over 23 years of service in DHHS, GSA, and DOI, I have direct experience with the existing civil service system and its vital role in ensuring effective government operations.
My primary concerns with the proposed rule include:
1.	Erosion of Merit System Principles and Depoliticization:
o	The creation of "Schedule Policy/Career" and the removal of civil service protections for "policy-influencing" positions fundamentally undermine the bedrock principles of the merit system. These principles, established to ensure a non-partisan, expert, and professional civil service, protect against political patronage and arbitrary dismissals.
o	The proposed rule risks politicizing the federal...

In both roles, I served administrations of different parties—but always with the understanding that my loyalty was to the Constitution and the law, not to any one president. I served knowing there were legal and procedural protections to allow me to act faithfully as I served the American people.

   Text sample: I. Introduction

This comment is submitted in strong opposition to any rulemaking or executive policy that would implement or reinstate "Schedule F" as a classification within the federal civil service. Schedule F was first introduced through Executive Order 13957, signed on October 21, 2020, and later revoked by Executive Order 14003 on January 22, 2021. The proposal to reintroduce this classification threatens the apolitical, merit-based principles that are the bedrock of the federal civil service.

II. Legal and Constitutional Concerns

A. Violation of the Merit System Principles

Schedule F contravenes the merit system principles codified in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b), which require that "employees be selected and advanced solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills" and "protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes." By placing career civil servants into an at-will employment category based solely on a vague...

   Text sample: I am a concerned citizen who is alarmed by the large scale layoffs of civil servants in a misguided, ill-informed and unsuccessful attempt to improve efficiency.  This regulation would make the firing of civil servants even easier.  It is too heavily tinged with executive overreach and a disregard for due process, and we have seen far too many examples of both in the last 100 days.  In the regulation the following quote is cited: “if the front door [is] properly tended, the back door [will] take care of itself.”  I have no faith that the back door will not instead be abused if the existing guardrails, as onerous and imperfect as they are, were to be removed.

This weakens our government's efficiency and effectiveness. We need nonpartisan federal workers who are there to actually do the job and not bow down before a "wanna-be" king. When whole agencies are fired enmasse because they are perceived to be partisan the expertise they have achieved is lost. It is not in the best interest of our country's welfare take away these worker protections. As a citizen this will make the government agencies (SS, Medicare, EPA etc.) that I rely on less efficient and unable to help me. It is also an extreme waste of tax payer money to fire the workers and rehire new ones under each new president.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century, particularly at a time when the civil service is already being threatened with excessive cuts without much forethought.

First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be...

   Text sample: Re: Docket ID OPM-2025-0001 – Comment in Opposition to Proposed Rule Establishing Schedule Policy/Career

To the Office of Personnel Management:

The proposed rule to establish “Schedule Policy/Career” is a fundamental departure from the spirit and purpose of the U.S. civil service. It is historically revisionist, legally flawed, and normatively corrosive to democratic accountability.

I. Foundational Mischaracterization of Civil Service Origins

The framing offered in OPM’s background section presents a misleading view of the historical trajectory of the federal workforce. While it is true that early federal employment was politicized, the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883 represented not a reluctant or temporary compromise, but an intentional pivot toward institutionalized merit, driven by public outrage over abuses.

Rather than reinforcing executive control, the history of civil service reform—from Pendleton to McKinley’s EO 101 and Roosevelt’s EO 173—demonstrates a steady...

   Text sample: I am a former federal employee who opposes moving positions into schedule F at will positions. There are many reasons that it is necessary for government employee positions to be protected not the least of which is the risk of partisan interference in agency activities. In addition to this, government employees are highly desirable to private corporations for a range of positions which in general pay more than government positions. Historically, while the government paid less it provided better benefits and stability of employment. If you take stability of employment away, then many will opt for higher paying jobs in the private sector. In my experience, agencies have highly loyal employees who are effective in their roles. In addition, when there is someone who is not effective, there are a range of actions that can be taken by an agency to deal with it. There is no proven need to implement this measure. I hope that the OPM takes this comment period seriously and reviews the...

Improving Performance Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service
Link: https://regulations.gov/document/OPM-2025-0004-0001
Comment
The rule proposed by the Office of Personnel Management identified by Docket No.
2025-06904 proposes to improve the career employee accountability and strengthen
the democratic responsiveness of the American government by addressing the long-
standing performance management challenges that occur in the Federal Workforce.
Agencies are required to follow the specific procedures to take “adverse actions”
against employees for misconduct or poor performance-based adverse actions as
stated in Chapter 75 and Chapter 43 United States Code. Under these chapters the
employee is allowed to appeal the decision to the Merit System Protection board and if
not successful can appeal to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. These processes are
time-consuming and difficult thus leading to infrequent removals. As...

   Text sample: I oppose the reintroduction of "Schedule F," which threatens the integrity of the merit-based civil service system. If this protection is lost, any current administration would fire Federal Employees to suit their political agenda. By allowing the removal of career employees without cause, it undermines due process protections under 5 U.S.C. § 7513 and the principles of the Pendleton Act. Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce, compromise expert input, and reduce government effectiveness. The Office of Personnel Management has a statutory duty under 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. to preserve an apolitical, professional civil service. I urge the administration and OPM to reject this proposal.

Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,ˮ
Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, RIN: 3206-AO80
Dear Office of Personnel Management:
Ryan Van Manen submit(s) these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM)
Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,ˮ
90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). I write to express opposi[on to the Proposed Rule.
I am a current federal civil servant, serving the public as an environmental engineer with the
U.S. Environmental Protec[on Agency (EPA), specializing in surface water quality. I take great
pride in the work I do for the American public. I have a degree in chemical engineering, and
several years of experience in the private environmental consul[ng field. I work on

   Text sample: Executive Summary
OPM's proposal to create "Schedule Policy/Career" (5 CFR § 213.3501) and strip incumbents of Chapter 43/75 protections exceeds OPM's statutory authority, violates Merit System Principles, and fails the APA's requirement for reasoned decision-making. If OPM ignores these comments, the rule will be ripe for vacatur under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).

⸻

I. Exceeds OPM's Statutory Authority
1. No Statutory Excepted-Service Schedule Exists - Title 5 creates only Schedules A, B, C, D, and SES. Neither CSRA § 3302 nor any statute authorizes a "Policy/Career" schedule.
2. CSRA's Repeal of Lloyd-La Follette Authority - The CSRA eliminated the hybrid-status regime; nothing in Title 5 permits stripping adverse-action protections while retaining "competitive status."

II. Arbitrary and Capricious Definition of "Policy-Influencing"
1. Failure to Justify Broad Expansion - OPM offers only a "plain English" gloss on "confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or...

   Text sample: Removing process protections from civil service jobs is a dreadful idea. It will politicize positions that are and should remain based on expertise, and we have already seen during this administration how officials selected for their loyalty to the president (rather than their systemic expertise) has cost us as a country. Doing what is already done with regard to about 4,000 positions to another 50,000 positions spells disaster for the United States as cronyism will replace subject matter expertise and competence, further undermining confidence in government. But more importantly, it will make all Americans less safe as the chief characteristic for employability will be loyalty to one person in preference to any level of competence at one's job.

   Text sample: I oppose the proposed new rules proposed by the Office of Personnel Management in Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004. They seem specifically designed to let a single administration sweep aside large numbers of federal employees, which is damaging for many reasons:

1. It amplifies hyperpartisanship. Reclassifying so many jobs as "at-will" promotes a system where every incoming administration drastically retools the face of the federal workforce - not just replacing lead administrators, but rank-and-file workers serving the federal government.

2. It threatens institutional knowledge, which is a vitally important and often-undervalued feature of institutions with long-term employees. Every sweeping set of layoffs will damage the expertise, capabilities, and knowledge of our federal government.

3. It is hostile to hard-working federal employees. They'll know that with every incoming administration, they may be swept aside; they'll know that every act of theirs may be judged through a partisan...

This document has been substantially edited to accurately reflect the true feelings and heartfelt beliefs of my family and friends

I strongly support  the reimplementation of Schedule F as proposed in Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service."

Schedule F would improve the federal workforce by by making thousands of public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service accountable, transparent and hopefully responsible . These roles demand correction, updating and reform to continue  the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service—not bureaucratic tradition.

This rule would allow us to expel entrenched inertia and replace it with innovation to manage public lands. That’s accountability—it’s a recipe for positive, necessary change and efficiency and the restoration of public...

The proposed creation of Schedule P/C (formerly Schedule F) is an attempt to classify as many employees as possible as at will employees who can be gotten rid of every 4/8 years when an administration changes. Additionally the proposed language for who would be moved into Schedule P/C is overly broad and does not adequately protect non-partisian career civil servants from being wrongly recategorized.  For example, the proposed regulations would encompass "positions of a confidential nature" which by the definition of confidential nature, would encompass the ENTIRE Intelligence Community (IC) and anyone with a Security Clearance.

The current Administration wants to revert to the Spoils system, which we abandoned in the 1870's.  That is nearly 150 years ago.  We instituted a fair system of hiring the best qualified individuals regardless of their political affiliation.  The current Administration wants to eliminate that system and replace it with an antiquated system of appointing "loyal" workers into our federal workforce.  In the meantime, they want to eliminate the protections afforded under the current system.  All of this strikes me as unfair, backwards, and subject to political influence.  We can't continue to dismantle our government and make it less efficient, more likely to be politically influenced and less likely to be populated with workers who are experts in their jobs.

This week is Public Service Recognition Week—a time meant to honor the people who serve this country, not silence them.

But right now, the people who manage our national wildlife refuges—those who restore wetlands, protect endangered species, and serve communities—are facing a direct and dangerous threat.

The administration is planning to reinstate Schedule F, a policy that strips career civil servants of their protections. If fully implemented, it could allow refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals to be fired without cause—simply for doing their jobs.

And with nearly 10% of refuges completely unstaffed, the system is already on the brink. This policy threatens to dismantle what little workforce remains to protect wildlife and serve communities.

As a federal scientist and physician, and as a US citizen, I submit this comment in my personal
capacity, drawing on over 15 years of service to Veterans and the US public at large.
The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, enacted January 16, 1883, established competitive
examinations for federal positions and created the U.S. Civil Service Commission to protect
employees from political firings⁹¹⁰¹¹. It initially covered only about 10 percent of federal jobs but
expanded rapidly under successive presidents, laying the groundwork for a professional,
nonpartisan civil service¹¹. The Act outlawed patronage in hiring and promotions, aiming to
replace the “spoils system” that had rewarded political loyalty rather than competence¹⁰.
The proposed rule entitled “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the
Civil Service” would...

I write today to express my strong opposition to this proposed rule. 

Reclassifying federal employees to "Schedule F" or "Schedule Policy/Career" poses significant risks to the effectiveness and integrity of the federal government. This reclassification would undermine the expertise within the federal workforce, degrade the quality of public services, and erode the meritocratic principles that are foundational to good governance.

The reclassification would degrade expertise in the federal government. Federal employees are often hired based on their specialized knowledge and experience in their respective fields. By reclassifying these positions, there is a risk of replacing seasoned professionals with individuals who may lack the necessary expertise.

--- ATTACHMENT CONTENT ---
I oppose OPM’s proposed rule, “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in
the Civil Service” (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, RIN 3206-AO80). I worked as a human resources
specialist at various federal agencies for over 20 years. I am deeply concerned about the impact
OPM’s rule will have on the federal workforce and the American public. I urge OPM to withdraw
the proposed rule or amend the final rule in accordance with the suggestions below. I also
request that OPM extend the public comment period by at least the number of days that
www.regulations.gov was unavailable to the public for posting and viewing comments on this
proposed rule.
Background
OPM provides a weak and misleading basis for the proposed rule. In a mere 12 months, OPM
disavows its own stance and rationale (including OPM’s interpretation of the historical and legal
bases) as to what positions are policy-influencing, what procedures should be followed...

   Text sample: The civil service is grounded in the principle that public servants owe allegiance to the Constitution, not to any single President or political agenda. This rule flips that principle on its head. It asserts that employees in Schedule Policy/Career roles must “faithfully implement administration policies” and that failure to do so—even in the absence of misconduct, justifies immediate dismissal. In practice, that means career professionals are now expected to suppress dissent, comply without question, and ignore potential ethical, legal, or factual concerns. The message is clear: loyalty will be rewarded with job security; scrutiny or resistance will result in removal. This is not accountability, it is the institutionalization of obedience. The public deserves a federal workforce that can speak truth to power, identify flaws in policy, and uphold the rule of law without fear of reprisal. This rule extinguishes that capacity. It invites political interference, undermines morale, and...

Their positions should not be based on their political persuasion, nor should they be forced to "account" for their personal beliefs to their supervisors or adminstrators. We all need to know that the people who work for our government providing services across the spectrum of departments are NEUTRAL, and focused on the needs of the citizenry within the guidelines provided by the laws and regulations created by Congress. No one should lose their job because they are deemed insufficient loyal to an individual. As I have done in the past, people who pledge to support the Constitution owe their loyalty to the principles of our nation, and not to an individual. To demand such an idea is to contaminate our system of government.

   Text sample: As a federal employee commenting in my personal capacity, I strongly disagree with this rule. I have been in the civil service for nearly 16 years--under multiple Presidents from both parties. I also bring a wealth of expertise, knowledge, experience, and relationships between the federal government and the public we serve. I am able to do my job--advise senior leadership at my agency--because I know that I am protected by civil service protections that allow me to speak freely. I can offer my advisement based on things that are decidedly not partisan: the importance of protecting the public's health (from, for instance, deadly secondhand smoke exposure, or opioid overdose, or antibiotic-resistant infections), the scientific evidence base for my recommendations (again, the examples above have STRONG scientific evidence bases to draw from, which is empirical and critically important), the legal authorities that bind my agency (which I know intimately from my wealth of experience), and...

   Text sample: Russell Vought, the head of the OMB, has stated in black and white in Project 2025 that Schedule F will be used to reshape the federal government and politicize the civil service, creating another opportunity for the Trump administration to continue abusing its power as it has done daily since January 20, 2025.  This administration has shown that it does not care about what is best for everyone in this country, only those who support its agenda, and it cannot be trusted to do the right thing, no matter how insignificant the matter.  
     I strongly object to introducing or reviving the "Schedule F" classification for federal workers. This plan jeopardizes the civil service system's foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit. Notably, President Trump has supported this merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service...

   Text sample: Based on more than two decades in the Senior Foreign Service (now retired) and of working with civil servants of all ranks across the U.S. interagency, I believe the reinstatement of Executive Order 13957 of October 21, 2020 (“Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service”) with the amendments outlined in the January 20, 2025 Executive Order on the same subject would gravely damage the integrity and future of the U.S. federal civil service and poorly serve this Administration, future administrations, the United States, and the American people.

I agree with the many observers of the U.S. federal civil service argue that while our civil service cadre is generally hard-working and high-performing, the service would benefit from thoughtful reforms.  Hiring preferences for veterans and other restricted categories have in some cases limited the ability of federal civil service supervisors to hire the candidates best suited to fill vacant positions.  In federal departments and agencies...

There is no place for loyalty oathes to a particular U.S. President or administration in public service, nor should there ever be! Public servants work for us, the people of the United States of America. 
Shame on those who would institute such a requirement. Shame on those who would disrespect any of our public servants in this or any other.

Stop gutting our public agencies with firings, lay offs and reductions of operating funds.
Workers and administrators rights need to be protected from at-Will policies without checks and balances.

   Text sample: Hiring public servants should only be merit based-civil service exams,specific education,work experience & vetted hiring/ interview processes. Public servants are for the people,should provide consistent job performance for the people & not swung around through every incoming administration's new firing/ hiring process. It's a waste of time,waste of taxpayer money & disruptive & chaotic for the organization & meeting the needs of the taxpayer. Loyalty is ABSOLUTELY NOT any sort of appropriate hiring process for ANY government position.!!!

   Text sample: The proposed change to Schedule F, to reclassify some positions as Schedule Policy/Career, has some wording that sounds reasonable on the surface. Clearly any current employee who engages in misconduct or poor performance should be written up, put on a performance plan, and fired if necessary.  Wouldn’t that already be in place?  The dangerous language is “subverting presidential directives.”  That’s political, it’s irrational, and totally against the American tradition of filling public positions based on merit.  So what is merit?  It’s demonstrated competence- knowledge of the scope of the work. May take an advanced degree, particularly if it involves science.  Science is not anecdotes or latest social media craze.

   Text sample: This rule change will do the direct opposite of “ Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” a title which is doublespeak of the first order. 

This rule change will diminish and drain necessary expertise in the top leadership and down to even more inappropriate levels of executive agencies (e.g., field office heads) and cause volatility/management changes that will reduce the capabilities of every civil servant from carrying out statutory duties and delivering on their agencies’ missions for the American people. Instead of longstanding subject matter experts (non-partisan career civil servants) being promoted to management and retained to ensure continuity of agencies’ service delivery and strict adherence to laws passed by Congress, devoted civil servants will be replaced by partisan hacks/political loyalists with the changing of each administration. This rule change is counter-productive and will increase corruption, diminish the rule of law,...

Converting nonpartisan government positions to political appointments increases the risk of inefficient and ineffective services (therefore wasteful salary spending) due to political appointees who lack the expertise for the job to which they were appointed. We need government employees who work for the American people, not the president who appointed them (no matter the party in power), and who use their expert professional judgment rather than political allegiance (arising from political patronage system) in their daily activities. The US has been down this road before and developed a civil service model based on lessons learned.

To Whom It May Concern,
I have read the proposed rulemaking described in 5 CFR Parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, 
and 752. 
I deeply disagree with proposal to make various positions at the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), or National Science Foundation (NSF) political 
appointees as described in this paragraph, “Substantive participation and discretionary authority 
in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding 
opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting 
grant recipients. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a 
substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking 
positions.”
The proposed transformation of these roles into political appointments...

   Text sample: To quote a trusted source: “Politicization of public services generally worsens public-sector outcomes. Public employees invest less in developing their expertise and become more likely to exit. Instability and lack of experience reduce organizational performance. Politicization increases the influence of more ideologically radical appointees relative to more moderate civil servants. Politicization also reduces accountability. Bureaucrats worried about being fired fail to share uncongenial information with their political bosses and become less likely to respond to congressional oversight. As politicization begets lower transparency and administrative capacity, it increases waste and inefficiency.”

In other words, this is a TERRIBLE idea for the people of the United States. Full stop.

I am submitting this comment in my personal capacity as a U.S. citizen with public sector experience. I strongly oppose the proposed rule reintroducing Schedule F, which would allow federal agencies to reclassify civil service positions as at-will under the excepted service (Section II.C of the proposed rule, 89 FR 12765).

While the proposal claims to preserve merit principles, the reclassification process effectively eliminates due process protections for federal employees. This undermines the career civil service and risks politicizing the federal workforce, contrary to the Pendleton Act and Civil Service Reform Act, which were designed to prevent patronage and protect against political interference in hiring and firing.

Reducing job protections will accelerate the loss of experienced professionals across government. Agencies already struggle with recruitment and retention; this...

lems. First, it has obvious potential to undermine the objective of neutral compe-
tence in policy execution that is a basic part of the rule of law.1Second, it has the
connected ﬂaw of undermining the professional expertise that makes neutral policy
making possible.2I’ll explain.
The idea that public administration should be use a neutral and data-driven
competence in policy execution is one of the foundations of modern government.
1Perhaps the best description of why this is important is Max Weber’s description of the charac-
teristics of rational-legal authority . See Max Werber .1947. The Theory of Social and Economic
Organization. New York: Free Press, 329-340.
2Again, see Weber...

How will the proposed regulation avoid politicizing the NIH, including NIH Institute and Center Direcors, and division directors? How will the proposed regulation prevent increasing the turnover of key positions, which would limit longer-term planning and execution? How will it uphold anti-discrimination law by hiring based on merit, such as expertise and experience, rather than political views and affiliations?

Grant administrators do not set policy. Their work — drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating applications, and recommending awards — is guided by laws, regulations, and agency-established criteria. These roles are technical and compliance-based, not political or discretionary in the policymaking sense.

I absolutely oppose the reclassification of federal employees under Schedule F. Career civil servants are not political advocates, nor should they be. Qualified federal employees should not be able to be effortlessly replaced by unqualified partisan loyalists at the whim of some "agency" or political leaders (as demonstrated by the current administration). 

While in days of olde we, the citizenry of America, could trust that Presidential directives held merit and were issued keeping the best interests of American people in mind, this is no longer the case. Civil servants serve the people, not the administrators of government. 

This change should not be implemented as this very proposal would serve to undermine the democratic process and ultimately, jeopardize the welfare of the citizenry.

As a concerned citizen, I strongly oppose the proposed rule establishing a new “Schedule Policy/Career” designation. Career Civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. The proposed changes threaten the independence and stability of federal scientific agencies by allowing for at-will dismissal of career leaders, and eroding trust in nonpartisan, evidence-based leadership.

I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrity of the civil service by withdrawing this harmful proposal in its entirety.

   Text sample: As Nobel Laureates, the STEM community as a whole, and public policy experts have stated, agencies like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes for Health cannot meet their statutorily mandated scientific missions if politics, rather than scientific expertise, drive decision-making. Federally supported science has been so successful, in no small part, because agency staff are typically expert scientists beholden to ensuring that the agencies deliver world-class science." Scientists--and not politicians--should be the ones drafting federal funding opportunities, evaluating grant applications and recommending funding. Thus, I firmly oppose  the proposed rule under consideration known as "Schedule F". It will lead to the collapse of the scientific endeavor in the United States, which will also have extremely harmful economic effects on the United States. If adopted, Schedule F will wound this nation for decades to come, until it is reversed. I write this in protest of...

I am submitting this comment in my personal capacity as a United States citizen and federal employee, using personal equipment on personal time. I strongly oppose the proposed rule to establish a new Schedule F-style employment category, as outlined in Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004. I am submitting this comment anonymously because I am already fearful of retaliation by the Trump administration for opposing this rule, the exact effect the administration wants to codify through this rule.

The stated goal of the rule—to allow agencies to more efficiently remove career employees in policy-influencing positions for poor performance, misconduct, or partisanship—is deeply misleading. In practice, this rule would have the opposite effect. Rather than reducing corruption or partisanship, it would invite and institutionalize it by undermining the nonpartisan, merit-based principles that have guided the federal civil service for decades.

All simply because someone not educated in the matter takes offense to something. Scientists train for years and decades to do science; they are the experts in this area and politics does not belong in science!!

As a recent former federal employee, I understand that it is difficult to remove career federal employees from their positions even with evidence of misconduct or poor performance, that is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed. However, removing an employee for not following Presidential directives is reflective of an authoritarian regime. This proposed policy change shows that fed workers must do as they are told no matter  what. This is disgusting, anti-democractic, and anti-American. Fed workers should be trusted to do their jobs because of their demonstrated expertise, experience, and education, not because they are Trump loyalists.

   Text sample: As a private citizen and someone who volunteers with church and non-profits to support people facing life's challenges, I respectfully submit this comment in opposition to the Office of Personnel Management’s proposed rule (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004). I strongly object to this rule change. It threatens to strip agencies of experienced personnel who carry deep institutional knowledge. That knowledge is not easily replaced—and without it, vital services may become slower, less accurate, and harder to access, especially for marginalized communities. This rule risks making government less responsive to the people it’s meant to serve.

They take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the U.S., not any one party or president. No one chooses a federal career to put forth a biased viewpoint and no one chooses a federal career to fill their own pockets. Choosing a career in federal service is a calling and must be protected from the winds of politics. The strength of our country is on the backs of our non-partisan federal workers.

   Text sample: I oppose the Proposed Rule "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" (RIN 3206-AO80). In particular, I oppose the application of the Proposed Rule to the operations of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This Rule would allow the reclassification of thousands of government jobs as "policymaking positions". Reclassified employees could then be terminated without the usual review and appeal process that is now applied to civil service positions.

The following language in the Rule is very troubling in this regard: "Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions."...

   Text sample: This proposed rule is both highly disingenuous and extremely dangerous. This is a barely disguised attempt to politicize the federal workforce and force federal employees to put loyalty to the President above adherence to law and the Constitution, and above the best interests of the country and public they serve. Federal employees are politically neutral public servants. They are not an extension of the executive branch of government. This proposed regulation seeks to reshape the federal workforce into a tool of the President’s, instead of as the valuable civil service it’s been for decades. It is summarily wrong to equate unwillingness to implement unjust, illegal, or otherwise harmful policy with misconduct or poor performance when it is exactly the opposite. Federal workers who refuse to comply with corrupt and lawless practices are doing exactly what they should be doing and should not be penalized for it. This is such a blatant attempt to expand executive power and push our country..

As a practicing researcher in immunology and molecular biology for decades, and a former Special Government Employee as a Member of the NIAID Council, I am very aware of the operations of NIH and the decisions that go into funding grants on the NIH or intramural campus, and extramural grants across the country. It is essential that decisions on areas of emphasis be made on a rigorous scientific...

   Text sample: I am strongly opposed to this bill. The proposed rule risks politicization of the federal workforce and suggests no meaningful guardrails against this. The current administration will install political appointees which may suit those that voted for the current president. But it opens the door to allow the next president to appoint new people to serve their agenda. Civil service should be apolitical. Our cureacracy should serve the people, not the politicians.

   Text sample: I am leaving a comment on the proposed rule (RIN 3206-AO80) from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to change civil service positions (also called "policy-influencing positions" in the proposed rule) to Schedule F positions, which are exempt from adverse action procedures or appeals. I am strongly opposed to this proposal, especially for positions within scientific federal agencies (FDA, CDC, NIH, USDA, etc.). Current hiring processes for these positions are rigorous and ensure that only the best and most qualified candidates attain these positions. By shifting these positions to Schedule F and removing adverse action procedures and appeals, countless nonpartisan scientific advisors and policy makers would have their employment threatened by ever-changing partisan policies.

I am writing to strongly oppose this proposed rule. As a former federal employee who has served in both 
career and political (Schedule C) positions  at different times in my career, I have seen firsthand the 
importance of the distinction between career and political positions. This proposed rule would obliterate 
that distinction. It would represent an unprecedented increase in the politicization of th e federal

Re: “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: 2025-0004 RIN 3206-AO80

Dear Office of Personnel Management,

I am submitting this comment in my personal capacity as a longtime federal employee. I oppose the Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” (90 Fed. Reg. 17182, April 23, 2025).

As a civil servant at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), I help evaluate and register pesticides used in agriculture, homes, and the environment. Our decisions are guided strictly by science and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), which requires that pesticides not pose “unreasonable adverse effects on the environment” and a “reasonable certainty of no harm” to human health. EPA staff—including agronomists, entomologists, plant pathologists, nematologists,...

Over the course of two decades, I have provided critical information and analyses (often confidential and secret) to political appointees, some of which counseled against their proposed actions or provided information or data that contradicted their positions. Because I had civil service protections, I was able to provide honest input into their decision making processes. They were not obliged to use my data or analyses, but I was able to provide it. It was not without consequences, you could be removed from a project or not asked to brief a principal again, but civil service protections meant that you could uphold your oath to faithfully discharge your duties without fear of losing your livelihood.

Beginning with the illegal firing of the Inspectors General of 17 federal agencies created by Congress but housed in the Executive branch of the government, the administration has moved with all deliberate speed to ensure that the federal bureaucracy is torn down and replaced with a kakistocracy -- “rule by the incompetent” -- derived from the Greek words kakos (bad) and kratos (power, rule) and characterized by corruption, nepotism, incompetence, inefficiency, injustice, and tyranny.

   Text sample: As a concerned scientist, I strongly oppose the proposed rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” (OPM-2025-0004).

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the Schedule F classification for federal employees as described in the proposed rule titled “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” (Docket OPM-2025-0004). This proposal threatens the long-standing merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce that has served our country well for over a century.
First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the Office of Personnel Management proposed rule with Docket ID OPM-2025-0004.

The potential for abuse is clear. Although the executive branch has a wide mandate to administer laws as it sees appropriate, federal agencies have a mandate established by congress, and we have seen recent executive actions that violate both the spirit and the letter of federal law. If given the power to dismiss career civil servants for "undermining the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives" [sic], the executive branch will have the ability to fire individuals merely for following the laws of our nation as required by the constitution.

The potential for abuse, by this administration and future administrations of either party, is manifest, and amounts to a thinly veiled "loyalty" requirement for positions intended to be nonpartisan. The new rule risks undermining the credibility of our scientific agencies like the NIH and public trust in our government...

Comment:
The Civil Service Reform Act promises that federal employees will be “protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes.” 
The proposal states “These positions will remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis.”, yet the head of OBM and the President have been quite clear that this plan will be used to purge the civil service of anyone without absolute loyalty to President Trump, gutting the government of highly qualified employees and replacing them with yes men whose only qualifications are total dedication to the president over the rule of law, the Constitution and common sense.
There is a reason our Civil service is set up to be nonpartisan - to avoid cronyism and corruption.  This proposed plan will increase politicization while undermining the conditions of good administration.

   Text sample: I am a nurse and an educator and I have worked in research and teaching for over 20 years.  As a healthcare professional I strongly oppose the proposed rule establishing a new “Schedule Policy/Career” designation. This change threatens the independence and sustainability of federal scientific agencies like the NIH by allowing for at-will dismissal of career leaders. It risks politicizing science, compromising public health, and eroding trust in nonpartisan, evidence-based leadership and research. If this rule goes into affect it will have far-reaching consequences on the lives and health of people around the world.  I strongly urge the OPM to withdraw this detrimental proposal.

   Text sample: These proposed regulations do not achieve the stated goal of improving performance, accountability, and responsiveness in the civil service. They instead violate the letter and spirit of the Pendleton Act by making civil service positions "spoils" to be doled out be successive administrations based on party loyalty rather than qualifications. This will not only promote corruption, but will interfere with operational continuity of agency work - requiring massive onboarding and off boarding operations at the beginning of each new administration. The reason some federal managers believe they cannot fire employees is not because of the current system for disciplinary action. That functions fairly well, despite misleading reports to the contrary. It is because federal hiring practices and the lack of consistent federal funding make the ability to backfill positions incredibly difficult, leading to a reluctance to part with underperforming employees who are still providing more value than no...

Federal Employees should not be allowed to be fired at will. If there truly is"poor performance" there already is a process for removing such employees. This revised rule allows employees to be fired if the President doesn't agree with them. Fed employees should be non-partisan. This will ultimately silence those from making recommendations that are in the best interest of the people for fear it may not match what the president believes. Consider the leader of FEMA fired hours after indicating under oath in a hearing that cuts to FEMA would likely hurt the American people.

Politicizing their work is against how our government was designed to work, it is anti-Republic, anti-Democratic, dangerous, and toxic. 

This has been tried before, and it did not work out well. That is why Civil Service laws were enacted to exempt Civil Service employees and their employment from political loyalty tests and political influence. 

Going backwards is a dangerous, toxic, and bad idea.

   Text sample: The Trump administration has no business hiring only people who bow to Trump or to retaining only the same. Federal employees have traditionally been hired because they have expertise in the role for which they have been hired. To keep this country vibrant, growing and actually safe, means counting on employees who know what they are doing. That is not what we are seeing in this administration's desire to hire only cronies and those subservient to the president. I strongly disagree with the adoption or the. implementation of this Rule.

   Text sample: "Schedule F" is a BAD IDEA. DON'T DO IT! Regardless of how the architects of this proposed Rule describe its purposes, career federal civil servants such as I once was are fearful that they will be put on leave or fired for doing their jobs honestly and with integrity. They will be punished for providing factual information or pursuing their statutory goals. This proposed rule features numerous examples of "poor performers". That's irrelevant. A civil service process already exists to remove inadequate or dishonest  federal employees. This administration has already ignored that process by removing federal officials either without reference to performance, based on false claims about performance, or for simply performing their duties.

The straightforward effect of this Schedule Career/Policy Rule would be to spread fear and undermine the ability of civil servants to maintain conditions of good administration. DO NOT IMPLEMENT SCHEDULE F.

This action was litigated throughout the entire four years of the first Trump administration, so the agency’s leadership determined that the case was consistent with President Trump’s agenda. And the case fell squarely within the CFPB’s jurisdiction because Navient extended credit and serviced loans. 12 U.S.C. 5481(15)(A)(i). However, the first Trump administration was initially skeptical to the case. My understanding is that they leaned towards closing the matter. So why did the case survive? Rather, how did it survive?

   Text sample: As a scientist and federal employee, I strongly oppose Schedule Policy/Career, i.e., Schedule F. I believe the reclassification of career civil service employees who participate in the development of funding announcements and oversee review of grant applications would politicize the NIH, along with other agencies. This reclassification would reduce public trust in federally-funded science even lower than it currently is and reduce NIH and CDC’s ability to conduct scientific activities that protect the health of Americans. By putting these civil servants in a situation where they can be fired at will, their ability to speak truth to powerful political appointees that they advise will be diminished. I do not believe that this rule will meet its goal of more accountability, but rather increase politicization of the federal government. Civil service employees serve the American public, and should not feel that they are being forced to serve political agendas.

I oppose this proposed rule.  It will unnecessarily remove  job protections for knowledgeable career servants in important “policy influencing” positions, and create incentives for Administrations to unfairly fire  career servants and replace them with political appointees. 

The rule, if implemented, would impair the establishment of a knowledgeable workforce within the government for key positions where continuity across Administrations is beneficial.  It will make filling such positions with the best, most qualified people difficult (highly qualified individuals want jobs that are secure and won’t turn over with a new administration).

It is an unnecessary rule, as Civil Service rules regarding management of poor performance already exist and are not burdensome.   

Finally, the best policy work often requires sincere deliberation of opposing positions.  This rule...

I worked for several decades as a public policy researcher for a non-profit. My work, mostly in housing policy, involved frequent interactions with federal government staffers in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and other government entities. I am concerned about the impact the proposed policy will have on the management and oversight of government programs.

The policy will without question result in higher turnover and a reduction in numbers of department staff (as intended) through the conversion to positions excepted from civil service protections. This will create a critical loss of institional knowledge. The HUD programs with which I have experience are complicated and have a long history of decisions impacting their operation. Loss of staff familar with the history of these programs will lead to diminished understanding of program elements, and less effective oversight of...

   Text sample: I write in strong opposition to this rule and Schedule Policy/Career. This rule will not achieve its purported aims and will hurt the efficacy of the Federal workforce.

This rule will not increase career employee accountability. It inaccurately defines "policy-influencing" positions to include grantmaking positions at agencies like NIH and NSF, by including in Schedule F  positions “drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients.” These positions, like program directors, are not "policy-influencing" and should not be politicized. They are and should remain non-partisan.

Although this is just one specific example of what is wrong with Schedule Policy/Career, NO federal employees should be subject to reassignment to Schedule Policy/Career.

I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service. I have copied the specific sections I find objectionable below. This is blatant over reach by the Executive Branch, to further stack the federal government with loyalists. I oppose this for (at least) two reasons: it takes the responsibility away from the Legislative Branch where it rightfully belongs and, judging from the current appointments, would fill the government with incompetent, arrogant puppets.  

I believe in the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law, imperfect as it can be. This is another attempt to move all power into the Executive Branch, away from democracy.

Again, I strongly OPPOSE this policy change.

Relevant sections:
I. Background
B. Executive Orders 13957, 14003, 14171, and the Prior OPM Rulemaking

   Text sample: I am writing to point out that the proposed rule appears not to comply with Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, Pub. L. No. 105-277, entitled, “Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families.” This law, which to my knowledge has not been repealed, applies to any “Executive agency,” as defined in 5 U.S.C.  § 105, which appears to include the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Five U.S.C. § 1101 states that OPM is “an independent establishment in the executive branch.” Five U.S.C. § 105 states that an “Executive agency” means, among other entities, an “independent establishment.” Thus, it appears that this statutory requirement applies to OPM.
Under this requirement, “[b]efore implementing policies and regulations that may affect family well-being, each agency shall assess such actions with respect to whether” they have certain specified effects enumerated in seven paragraphs in the statute. OPM’s proposed rule does not appear to...

I submit the following comment in opposition to OPM’s proposed rule (RIN 3206-AO09) to create a new “Schedule F”-like employment category (Schedule Policy/Career or “Schedule P/C”), which would effectively strip civil service protections from career employees in policy-related roles. I oppose the following specific sections of the proposed rule:
§ 213.3611(a) – Definition of policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions: This language is vague and overly broad, and risks sweeping in a wide range of roles that have no true policy-setting authority but perform critical analytical or technical functions.
§ 213.3611(b) – Exemption from competitive service protections: I strongly object to the reclassification of roles into a category that allows for at-will removal, without the due process safeguards currently provided under Title 5.
