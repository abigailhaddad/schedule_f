   Text sample: This order states Schedule Policy/Career employees:

"are required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the President. Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal."

It also states that:

"the President will make the final decision about which positions go into Schedule Policy/Career."

And "guidance about positions agencies should consider in their Schedule Policy/Career positions" includes those with:

"Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions."

   Issue: Not found in truncated text
   Comment IDs: OPM-2025-0004-0363
   Text sample: A bedrock principle of our republic is a professional and nonpartisan civil service, a system carefully constructed on merit since the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883. The proposed "Schedule F" classification poses a significant threat to this enduring foundation. By potentially allowing the reclassification and dismissal without cause of a broad spectrum of career civil servants, particularly those engaged in crucial policy formulation and analysis, this initiative opens a dangerous pathway for political considerations to unduly influence hiring and firing decisions. This directly contravenes the spirit and letter of 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which clearly mandates that federal employment decisions must be rooted in merit-based principles, shielded from the vagaries of political influence.

Furthermore, the imprecise and expansive criteria for inclusion under "Schedule F" raise serious concerns regarding the fundamental due process protections currently afforded to career federal...

   Text sample: I am writing to express my strongest opposition to the Office of Personnel Management's proposed rule implementing Executive Order 14171, which would create a new "Schedule Policy/Career" in the excepted service and remove procedural protections and appeal rights for employees designated as occupying "policy-influencing" positions.

This proposed rule would significantly disrupt the functioning and effectiveness of the federal government in several critical ways:
1.	Compromising the Merit System and Operational Continuity: The proposed changes undermine foundational merit principles while threatening the professional, non-partisan civil service that ensures continuity across administrations. Career civil servants with institutional knowledge are essential for maintaining operations during transitions of power.
