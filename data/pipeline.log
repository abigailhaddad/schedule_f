   Text sample: As a member of the vision research community and a supporter of evidence-based public policy, I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule that would enable the reclassification of federal employees into a new Schedule F category.
This proposed rule would severely jeopardize the integrity and continuity of scientific research across the federal government, including at the National Eye Institute (NEI), where apolitical, expert leadership is essential to advancing breakthroughs in vision science and protecting the eye health of millions of Americans. Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatmen

   Text sample: I am submitting these comments in opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed regulation ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career.‚Äù  The proposed rule undermines more than 140 years of civil service reform following the spoils system. It opens the door to politically motivated firings and tramples on employees‚Äô constitutional and statutory rights.  Moreover, the proposed regulation to dismantle civil service protections destabilizes the career workforce, politicizes the day- to- day work of government, and erodes the very idea of a professional, independent civil service.  Specific concerns are presented below.

¬∑       Performance: This proposal gives lip service to performance management, but rather than providing thoughtful reform, it weaponizes the classification of ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù roles to make it easier to purge career staff. It‚Äôs the latest attempt from this Administration to replace professionalism with ideological alignment.

   Text sample: The Alliance for American Leadership, a bipartisan coalition of over 300 national security experts and emerging leaders, firmly opposes the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed reintroduction of ‚ÄúSchedule F.‚Äù This proposal threatens vital civil service protections, potentially affecting nearly 12,000 mission-critical civilians at the Department of Defense (DOD).

   Text sample: I am writing to express strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed rule OPM-2025-0004-0001, which seeks to reclassify approximately 50,000 federal employees into a newly designated Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) category. This proposal, a revival of the previously rescinded Schedule F, threatens the foundational principles of a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service and poses significant risks to the integrity, efficiency, and accountability of federal operations.

Erosion of Merit-Based Protections

The cornerstone of the federal civil service is its commitment to merit-based hiring and retention, ensuring that employment decisions are grounded in qualifications and performance rather than political affiliation. By reclassifying positions into Schedule P/C, the proposed rule would strip affected employees of critical protections against arbitrary dismissal, effectively making them at-will employees. This undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, whic

   Text sample: I strongly oppose creation of a Schedule ‚ÄúPolicy/Career‚Äù for federal workers. This proposed regulation would decimate the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, non-partisan federal workforce for nearly 150 years. Merit-based federal employment means a more efficient government for American taxpayers and better public services for the American people. This proposed regulation would make our federal agencies less effective and expose the American public to the type of corruption that civil service laws were enacted to protect against.

The creation of Schedule ‚ÄúPolicy/Career‚Äù and the broad way in which it is being interpreted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) are contrary to Constitutional due process. It has long been recognized that non-probationary government workers are entitled to due process before they can be removed or have other employment actions taken against them. See Gilbert v.

Below are formal, structured objections organized by legal authority and rule part, including statutory and case Iaw citations. 1. The proposed Schedule rule undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which institutionalized merit-based hiring; By   creating an at-will  employment category  for policy-influencing roles, this rule violates the spirit and letter of 5 U.S.C. 2301 Schedule process   afforded  under U.S.C_ 7513, which guarantees   notice , an opportunity to respond, written decision for adverse actions such as removal, demotion, suspension. 3.

   Text sample: I oppose the proposed rule that would create a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù category.

Civil service protections were first introduced in the late nineteenth century in response to the ‚Äúspoils‚Äù system whereby supporters of government officials were appointed to political offices. The main problem with that system was that it promoted corruption and inefficiency. Several civil service reform acts have been passed over the years to ensure government positions were filled by non-partisan, competent, and qualified civil servants.

America needs a federal workforce that is professional, nonpartisan and can provide honest, evidence-based advice to policymakers without fear of political retaliation. Turning many career roles into at-will positions risks politicizing government operations and threatens the reliability of important public programs.

Additionally, the rule states time and time again that this is not a mechanism by which federal employees can be fired for their political affiliat

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed change, as it would grant the executive branch the authority to place political operatives in government positions. Although this change is framed as a way to make the federal workforce more efficient, it effectively turns federal workers into at-will employees who can be dismissed for vague reasons.

We have already witnessed unjust firings based on vague claims of unsatisfactory performance, even for workers whose contributions were previously commended. There have been terminations for practicing transparency, for refusing to prioritize this administration over the American public, and for simply telling the truth.

Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, has remarked that this change 'will erode the government's merit-based hiring system and undermine the professional civil service that Americans rely on.'

Our country was founded on the principle that hard work, expertise, distinction, and seniority are valuable.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose OPM‚Äôs proposed regulation that would create a new "Schedule Policy" or "Schedule F-like" classification for certain career civil service positions. While the rule claims these positions will remain career, nonpartisan roles, it dangerously reclassifies them as at-will‚Äîstripping critical due process protections and appeal rights from civil servants who influence policy.

The proposal undermines the foundational merit system principles that ensure a professional, apolitical civil service. Career employees who are subject to removal without the right to appeal or due process are effectively politicized, regardless of their official designation. This opens the door to improper political interference and retaliation against employees who provide objective analysis, raise legitimate concerns, or lawfully dissent from executive directives.

Moreover, the proposed rule frames the changes as necessary to remove employees who ‚Äúundermine the democratic process by intentionally s

   Text sample: I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. The proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù would call into question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for our economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and many other statistics. The federal statistical system plays an essential role in improving the lives of all Americans as well as informing critical policy decisions with evidence that is timely, relevant, and accurate. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule due to the following:

I strongly oppose the reclassification of NIH leadership positions as political appointments under Schedule F. This change would cause demonstrable harm to American health and scientific progress.

Legal and Public Health Concerns:
The proposed rule violates the principle that federal grant decisions should be based on scientific merit, not political allegiance. By subjecting NIH Institute Directors and Division Directors to political appointment, this regulation will:

- Compromise patient outcomes by prioritizing political loyalty over scientific expertise in research leadership

- Waste taxpayer resources through constant leadership turnover that disrupts multi-year research initiatives

- Undermine public safety by politicizing decisions about which diseases and treatments receive federal research funding

- Damage American competitiveness as other nations maintain merit-based scientific leadership while we abandon it

   Text sample: The proposed rule to weaken civil service protections risks creating significant operational inefficiencies and increased costs for federal agencies due to higher employee turnover and the loss of experienced staff. This instability will disrupt critical government functions, delay important projects, and burden agencies with costly legal challenges from wrongful termination lawsuits. Moreover, agencies responsible for national security and public safety depend on a stable, skilled workforce, and this rule threatens to undermine their effectiveness. Additionally, reduced job security and a hostile work environment will deter qualified professionals from joining or remaining in federal service, making it harder to recruit top talent in essential fields. Beyond these practical concerns, the administration should consider the potential political backlash and erosion of public trust that could result from alienating federal employees and citizens who rely on competent government services.

   Text sample: Federal science should be driven by evidence, not political agendas. Schedule F would allow political appointees to replace career scientists, making it easier to suppress or distort research that doesn‚Äôt align with an administration‚Äôs views. It could also lead to political interference in federal research grants‚Äîredirecting funding based on ideology rather than scientific merit.
Federal agencies depend on experienced scientific experts and data analysts with deep knowledge of complex systems. Under Schedule F, these experts could be removed en masse, resulting in (further) significant brain drain and the loss of institutional memory and technical expertise. Without civil service protections, scientists may feel pressured to self-censor or alter their findings to match political expectations. This would seriously damage the credibility and undermine integrity of government science. Accurate scientific input is essential in emergencies like pandemics, natural disasters, and chemical exp

RE: Public Comment in Response to Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service [Docket No. OPM‚Äì2025‚Äì0004]

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule due to the following:

Politicization: Schedule Policy/Career could lead to the politicization of the federal statistical workforce. Official federal statistics clearly influence public policy of all sorts: monetary, fiscal, regulatory, etc. Thus, a President could classify many statistical agency positions as Policy/Career. Then, for example, Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äô leaders could be fired for releasing or planning to release jobs or inflation statistics unfavorable to the Presiden

   Text sample: I respectfully submit this comment urging the withdrawal of the proposed rule published on April 23, 2025 (90 FR 17182). The rule unlawfully undermines procedural rights conferred by statute, departs from long-standing legal interpretation, and conflicts with the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) own 2024 final rule, ‚ÄúUpholding Civil Service Protections and Merit System Principles‚Äù (89 FR 24982). If finalized, this regulation will be vulnerable to legal challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Constitution.

1. Conflict with Statutory Framework
The proposed rule would reclassify ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù positions into a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career,‚Äù eliminating coverage under 5 U.S.C. chapters 43 and 75, and removing appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).

I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule published in the Federal Register on April 23, 2025, which seeks to modify key protections for federal employees under the guise of improving performance and accountability.

While efficiency in government is essential, this rule represents a significant rollback of long-standing due process protections for federal employees and creates conditions ripe for politicization, abuse, and retaliation‚Äîparticularly for whistleblowers, marginalized employees, and those working under subjective performance standards.

Key Concerns & Legal Basis

1. Violation of Civil Service Protections (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301 & ¬ß 7513)

This rule appears to undermine the merit system principles established in 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301, which require fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of federal employment.

   Text sample: I submit this comment to express concern over the insufficient and selectively interpreted data cited in support of OPM‚Äôs proposed rule to establish ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù within the excepted service.

1. Overreliance on Subjective Survey Data
The proposed rule repeatedly cites results from the Merit Systems Protection Board‚Äôs (MSPB) Merit Principles Survey and the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) to claim that agencies struggle to remove poor performers. For example, the rule notes that only 41 percent of supervisors report confidence in removing an employee for serious misconduct, and that only 26 percent feel confident removing an employee for poor performa

Why the description of this rule states "These positions will remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis," the reality already in evidence is this would not, in fact, be true.

   Text sample: I am deeply concerned about the proposed Schedule F regulation and its potential to undermine the integrity of federal scientific institutions. Classifying NIH grantmaking roles‚Äîsuch as Institute and Center Directors‚Äîas ‚Äúpolicymaking positions‚Äù subject to political appointment poses a serious threat to the objectivity and continuity of federally funded science.

Such a change risks politicizing key scientific leadership roles, which could compromise merit-based grant decisions, lead to increased leadership instability, and disrupt the long-term planning that is essential for impactful research. Decisions about research funding should be grounded in scientific expertise and peer review, not political ideology.

Enacting Schedule F in its current form could significantly erode the credibility and effectiveness of the NIH and similar agencies, slowing scientific progress and diminishing public confidence in government-supported research. I strongly urge that science-based positions be exc

I firmly oppose the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed reintroduction of ‚ÄúSchedule F.‚Äù This proposal threatens vital civil service protections, potentially affecting nearly 12,000 mission-critical civilians at the Department of Defense (DOD).

According to the Congressional Research Service,* this proposed rule could reclassify approximately 11,910 senior-level DOD employees ‚Äî including 3,300 from the Army, 3,112 from the Navy, 1,592 from the Air Force, and 3,906 from other DOD entities ‚Äî as at-will political appointees.

   Text sample: I am writing as a concerned constituent to express my strong opposition to the proposed implementation of Schedule F, which would reclassify thousands of federal employees as political appointees and strip them of longstanding civil service protections.

 

This proposal undermines over a century of bipartisan progress toward a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce. The merit-based civil service system, established by the Pendleton Act of 1883, was specifically designed to prevent the kind of political patronage and instability that Schedule F would reintroduce. Allowing mass reclassification of career civil servants would open the door to politicization, replacing expertise and institutional knowledge with political loyalty.

 

Such a drastic change poses serious risks to government performance and national security. Research and the experience of former federal executives make clear that politicizing the workforce leads to reduced administrative capacity, slower response to cr

   Text sample: For many years, agencies like the NIH and NSF have funded scientific research through rigorous, peer-reviewed processes designed to remain free from political influence. This system has been key to driving medical breakthroughs and advancing treatments that have improved and saved countless lives. A new proposal, however, would designate all NIH Institute and Center Directors, as well as Division Directors, as political appointees. This change would fundamentally alter the leadership structure of the NIH, opening the door to political interference in what has traditionally been an evidence-based and independent agency. Such a shift could destabilize critical research efforts by increasing leadership turnover and disrupting long-term projects. Vital programs focused on cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer‚Äôs, infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, and emerging health threats would be at risk of delays or politically motivated changes in direction.

   Text sample: In no ambiguous terms, this regulation change is an awful mistake, and not a single thing about it is advantageous or beneficial to anyone involved. OPM needs to recognize job security is why professionals choose Government and Federal service in the first place. The pay is strictly worse compared to private industry counterparts (and even acknowledges this in their guidance for the "Fork in the Road" deferred resignation program), the health benefits are continually outpaced, the career commitment is lifelong, and recategorizing to schedule F will make entry-level and new positions untenable to fill -- which are necessary with the inevitability of cumulatively increasing retirements each year. Making federal work a miserable venture is not going to suddenly result in an uptick of masochistic volunteers who want worse pay, worse work conditions, and a partisan predicate for appointment filling.

I write in unequivocal opposition to this proposed rule, which seeks to reintroduce Schedule F--now rebranded as "Schedule Policy/Career." While framed as a performance initiative, it is in reality a
blueprint for politicizing the federal workforce through a loyalty test to the President. It would dismantle core due process protections and turn career civil servants into at-will employees, vulnerable to dismissal for failing to conform to political ideology.

   Text sample: I am writing to comment on a proposed rule regarding: Agency name (OPM), Docket ID (OPM-2025-0004) and RIN (3206-AO80). I am concerned that the proposed rule emphasizes the importance of speed in eliminating employees from their positions. While efficiency is worth pursuing, quickly eliminating seasoned employees is unlikely to increase operational efficiency, as it removes years of earned expertise from the operation, and if it's done without careful consideration and process. As an employee who's been through several organizational layoffs, I can say for certain that while efficiency in firing staff does lead to an immediate benefit to the ledgers of the organization, the downside to the organization in the long-term is often more meaningful. Employees of any organization, governmental or otherwise, are people, and people deserve a chance to learn of their shortcomings and then time to demonstrate a willingness and ability to improve on them.

   Text sample: By converting these positions to political appointments, this increases the risk of introducing inefficiencies. If an employee of a typical engineering firm had to focus on appeasing their latest manager who showed up every 4-8 years rather than following the best practices and foundational expertise of their industry, that would be a poor employee. The same is true of a government employee. There are still processes for removing a bad employee or for moving them to where they can do less "damage." There is no recourse from replacing an employee's focus on their job with a focus on playing politics.

Some jobs should be political. Some jobs should have term limits.  But if every job was like that, there would be no experts, no lifelong "greybeards" who keep the gears of civilization turning.

The underlying logic of this proposal is that, 1) all federal employees, no matter where they are located or what they do, must first and foremost be loyal to the President. This is, of course, patently ridiculous. 2) It implies that anyone can do any Federal employee's job; there is no requirement for institutional knowledge or specialization, or years of experience. This, too, is patently ridiculous. Federal employees hold positions ranging from lower-level (security guards and janitors, for example) to highly educated and experienced roles (research scientists and administrators). In any of these roles, Federal employees need to first perform the duties of the position to the level expected in their performance documents. As part of that review process, they should not be working against the government, no matter who the President is at the time. However, allegiance to that President above all else, as implied here, is UNAMERICAN and ACONSITUIONAL.

I am submitting this comment as an academic physician-scientist with more than a decade of experience conducting NIH-funded research at Massachusetts General Hospital with appointments at Harvard Medical School and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

   Text sample: Dear Office of Personnel Management:

I write to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule entitled "Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service", published on April 23, 2025. The proposal seeks to exempt a newly defined category of ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù positions from the statutory protections of 5 U.S.C. Chapters 43 and 75, including the right to appeal adverse personnel actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). This proposal is inconsistent with governing federal statutes and exceeds the scope of executive authority.

1. Statutory Protections Cannot Be Waived by Regulation

Congress has clearly and intentionally established a legal framework that governs performance-based and adverse actions affecting federal employees. Under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 4303 and 7513, covered employees are entitled to procedural protections, including advance notice, an opportunity to respond, and the ability to appeal to the MSPB. These protections were cod

Scientific grants should be evaluated by nonpartisan career civil servants with appropriate expertise and experience, dedicated to the long term mission of their agencies.

The rule indicates that all involved in all grantmaking are considered policymaking positions and that the President can dictate whether those individuals' actions are aligned with their policies -- no matter who the President is or their party affiliation. Those involved in grantmaking should be nonpartisan career civil servants with appropriate expertise and experience to write funding announcements, evaluate grant applications, and recommend grant funding to achieve the missions of their agencies. They should not have to live in fear that their positions would be at risk if their expert-driven, rigorous decision-making is not consistent with one person's opinions. Adoption

Date: 25 April 2025

Dear Office of Personnel Management,

I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule (OPM‚Äì2025‚Äì0004) that would reclassify federal scientists, statisticians, and other technical experts into the newly created ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù (formerly Schedule F) category, eliminating their long-standing civil service protections.
As a Principal Statistician at StatCon Consulting, with over 30 years of experience in biostatistics and data science across academia, industry, and government collaborations, I am deeply alarmed that this rule would make thousands of federal employees at-will‚Äîstripping them of due process protections that are foundational to a professional, nonpartisan civil service.

   Text sample: With regard to the proposed OPM rule to politicize the civil service via the Schedule Policy/Career reclassification of federal employees, removing their civil service protections, and rendering them at-will workers, subject to illegal terminations based on baseless political preference. As a concerned American and decorated combat Veteran, I argue that the proposed rule is unlawful, procedurally deficient, and contrary to the public interest, particularly for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The rule should be withdrawn with prejudice immediately based on the following legal rational:
First, it is a violation of Statutory Civil Service Protections. The proposed rule undermines the merit-based civil service system codified in Title 5 of the U.S. Code, particularly 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301, which mandates that federal employment be based on merit principles, free from political influence.

   Text sample: The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 were crucial pieces of legislation that decreased political influence within the federal workforce. Prior to these acts, government jobs were often awarded based on political connections or nepotism. These acts marked a significant step in creating a meritocracy rather than a "spoils system." We have been better off because of them; civil servants have been able to remain consistent and unbiased in their work despite the consistent rotation of elected politicians from different parties.

The bias in the language of this rule change summary is telling: "This will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives." In other words, if employees refused to follow Presidential directives--even directives that may be illegal or immoral--agencies could suspend,

   Text sample: In the history of our government, those appointed to policy-influencing positions are typically very senior hires with a long track record that is publicly available.  That is the point of these hires - they come in with experience, a history of success with program building and overcoming challenges.  There is no reason for these positions to be at-will positions because this is not a new hire, they do not need a probationary period.  There exist procedures and processes by which agencies can remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct or perform poorly in the eyes of a community of engaged stakeholders.  The interpretation of not supporting or undermining the democratic process is entirely subjective, and can not be used as a basis for removing employees from policy-influencing positions.

Similarly, to allow removal of an employee in a policy-influencing position based on "intentionally" subverting Presidential directives is subjective, and a wholly erroneous a

   Text sample: Dear Office of Personnel Management,
I am writing to express serious concerns regarding the proposed rule to create Schedule Policy/Career positions within the excepted service. While I understand the stated goal of enhancing accountability, this rule is fundamentally flawed legally and as a matter of policy. Below, I outline specific issues related to statutory conflicts, constitutional challenges, procedural deficiencies, and broader policy implications.

The proposed rule appears to contravene several provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), which established a uniform framework for employee protections. Specifically:

   Text sample: As a dedicated scientist and small business owner committed to the principles of evidence-based research and the mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I am deeply concerned about the proposed rule titled "Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" (FR Document: 2025-06904).

The proposal suggests reclassifying policy-influencing positions into a new "Schedule Policy/Career" category, rendering them at-will roles exempt from standard adverse action procedures and appeals. Although these positions are described as remaining career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis, the at-will nature inherently introduces a vulnerability to political influence.

   Text sample: I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule (OPM-2025-0004-0001) that would reintroduce a Schedule F-type classification in the federal workforce. This policy is misguided, legally questionable, and threatens the nonpartisan integrity of the civil service.

First, the proposal undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 7511), which limits the exception of civil service protections to a narrow category of positions that are ‚Äúconfidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating.‚Äù The proposed rule goes far beyond this intent by opening the door to the mass reclassification of career civil servants without sufficient statutory authority.

Second, this proposal raises serious constitutional concerns. Federal employees possess a property interest in their continued employment, and reclassifying positions to at-will status without individualized due process may violate the Fifth Amendment‚Äôs Due Process Clause. As highlighted in Kloeckne

   Text sample: The Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed rule, OPM-2025-0004-0001, amending 5 CFR Part 731, delegates authority to the OPM Director to make suitability determinations and issue removal directives for federal employees based on post-appointment conduct. This aligns with the reintroduction of Schedule F, rebranded as Schedule Policy/Career in 2025, aiming to reclassify career employees as at-will, stripping them of merit-based protections. As a union-minded scholar, I oppose this rule for its assault on meritocracy, due process, and labor rights, threatening the integrity of the federal civil service.
The federal civil service, rooted in the Pendleton Act of 1883, ensures competence and impartiality, shielding employees from political pressures. The proposed rule undermines this by centralizing authority in the OPM Director, mandating agency compliance within five workdays, and aligning with Schedule F‚Äôs agenda to politicize the workforce.

This rule would be create a significant risk of political interference with scientific integrity and decision-making within HHS. Notably, "Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions," is of particular concern given the risk of political appointees being placed in roles (NIH director, program officers) that have gone to scientists and administrators with scientific knowledge, based on merit and experience, not on their political viewpoints. The risk of pressure to align scientific goals with the current administration's priorities will drive qualified individuals from the field and tear down the US's supremacy in science.

   Text sample: I am firmly opposed to any effort to implement or reinstate the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification within the federal workforce. This measure would fundamentally erode the merit-based civil service system that has ensured a professional, nonpartisan federal government for over a hundred years.



To begin with, Schedule F runs directly counter to the intent of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was designed to dismantle the spoils system by instituting merit-based hiring for federal roles. Reclassifying large numbers of career civil servants‚Äîespecially those involved in policy-making or analysis‚Äîwould expose them to dismissal without cause. This creates a clear path for politically driven employment decisions, contradicting the core tenet of a politically neutral civil service outlined in 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8), which safeguards employment decisions from partisan influence.

It would take away a merit based system that ensures a federal government full of workers that are nonpartisan and held to high standards. 
The creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883.

   Text sample: Here's why many citizens on both sides of the political discretion, are critical of this proposed rule, drawing on legal and policy arguments:
1. Undermining Merit-Based Hiring and Promotion:
 * Legal Basis: The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301 et seq.) established a merit-based system for federal employment, emphasizing qualifications, competence, and political neutrality. This system aims to prevent patronage and ensure a skilled and professional civil service.
 * The Issue with Proposed Schedule F: Critics argue that creating a new Schedule F, which would reclassify certain federal employees as "excepted service" and remove some of their civil service protections, could open the door to political influence in hiring and firing. Positions could be filled based on political affiliation or loyalty rather than merit, potentially leading to a less qualified and less effective workforce.

   Text sample: I oppose this proposed rule in the strongest of terms. The proposal to make these "at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals" is highly un-American; the American civil service has a long and proud tradition of hiring excellent patriotic workers (30% of them veterans: https://ourpublicservice.org/blog/public-servants-twice-over-veterans-in-the-federal-workforce/) who are highly engaged experts. Making their employment "at-will" flies in the face of the trust that Americans place in their government to engage in a calm, dedicated, and clear process to evaluate government employees. Any provision to "will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives." is antithetical to the proper apolitical and expert functioning of government service and puts the civil service at risk for being warped and subverted for politica

   Text sample: Schedule F poses a serious threat to the economy by destabilizing the federal government‚Äôs ability to efficiently implement and regulate policies that are vital to economic growth, stability, and innovation. Federal agencies play a critical role in ensuring a functioning economy, from enforcing financial regulations and overseeing industries to implementing trade policies and managing public infrastructure. When these roles are politicized, it undermines the effectiveness and consistency of economic governance.

First, Schedule F allows for the dismissal of career civil servants with deep expertise in areas like financial regulation, environmental policy, and trade. Replacing them with politically motivated appointees risks weakening the quality of decision-making. Expert, nonpartisan staff are essential for navigating complex economic issues, from responding to financial crises to ensuring fair competition and protecting consumer interests.

   Text sample: The U.S. civil service system was established with the Pendleton Act of 1883 in response to the corruption and inefficiency of the spoils system, where government jobs were awarded based on political loyalty rather than competence. The merit system is designed to ensure that public servants are hired and retained based on qualifications and performance, not political affiliation. Schedule F undermines this foundation by permitting political appointees to reclassify career employees, potentially leading to mass dismissals based on ideology or perceived disloyalty rather than job performance. 

Reintroducing Schedule F could result in the loss of thousands of experienced career officials who possess institutional knowledge critical to the functioning of government. These professionals play a key role in maintaining continuity across administrations, developing evidence-based policy, and upholding legal and ethical standards.

The proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule, which would reclassify certain federal employees into "at-will" positions exempt from competitive service protections, contravenes longstanding civil service laws, violates congressional intent, and risks judicial invalidation.

Statutory Protections Under the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) and Title 5

Civil service protections exist for a reason: to allow career experts to provide sound advice to their respective agencies and the administration, without the disruptions that would arise when leadership changes every four or eight years.  Political appointees are able to be dismissed at will, but extending this to include anyone working in a "confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character" would prevent those employees from providing reliable, unbiased policy opinions, without fear of retribution.  Removal of typical civil service protections will degrade the quality of applicants willing to fill those positions, and open opportunities for using government positions as a reward for political loyalty.  The extent of positions that would be considered "policy-influencing" is unclear, as is who is able to make the determination whether a position falls into that category, providing potential avenues for abuse.

Today it is often assumed that government workers enjoy much more job security than workers in the private sector. But according to one study, both federal public employees and private sector employees are fired at a rate of around 0.02 percent per year, on average.

The public conversation about government rarely offers a realistic sense of scale ‚Äî of how many bad candidates there really are, and what it would take to either improve their performance or replace them with people who would perform at a higher level.

I am writing to express my deep concerns about the proposal to reclassify federal civil servants under Schedule F, a policy that would strip them of critical job protections and undermine the merit-based system that has been the foundation of our civil service for over a century.  

The document, *Legal Vulnerabilities of Schedule F*, highlights how this policy is not only a dramatic departure from longstanding civil service principles but also likely unlawful. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) was enacted to ensure that federal employment is based on merit, not political loyalty. Schedule F, however, seeks to expand the narrow exception for confidential and policymaking roles‚Äîhistorically reserved for political appointees‚Äîto potentially tens of thousands of career civil servants. This would effectively return us to the corrupt "spoils system" of the 19th century, where government jobs were handed ou

Dear Director Ahuja:
I write to express strong opposition to the proposed rule establishing ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù
within the excepted service. In addition to the well-documented violations of the Administrative
Procedure Act and constitutional concerns, this proposal raises a range of operational, policy,
and workforce integrity issues that have not been adequately addressed in the rulemaking
record.
1. Vague Definition of ‚ÄúPolicy-Influencing‚Äù
The proposed rule does not clearly define what constitutes a ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù position. This
lack of precision invites inconsistent application across agencies, encourages subjective and
potentially political decision-making, and could result in the misclassification of technical,
analytical, or support roles that do not meaningfully shape policy. Without a clear standard, the
rule cannot be fairly or predictably implemented.

Introduction
The Office of Personnel Management's proposed rule to create a new "Schedule Policy/Career" category represents a fundamental threat to the merit-based civil service system that has served America for nearly 140 years. While presented as an accountability measure, this rule would effectively strip thousands of federal employees of basic job protections, politicize the career civil service, and undermine the institutional knowledge and expertise needed for effective governance.
Constitutional and Legal Concerns
Executive Overreach
The proposed rule asserts broad presidential authority to designate any "policy-influencing" career positions as at-will employees. However, this interpretation runs contrary to Congressional intent in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA). Congress created a balanced system with the Senior Executive Service (SES) for high-level policy posit

   Text sample: Re: Section I(C)(2)(iii) - Misrepresentation of Legislative History and Congressional Intent Regarding Policy-Influencing Terms
I strongly oppose the NPRM's mischaracterization of the phrases "confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating" as having ordinary meaning rather than being terms of art with specific legislative meaning.
I. Contradictory Internal Logic in the NPRM's Own Analysis
The NPRM's argument is fundamentally self-contradictory. While claiming these terms have their "plain English meaning," the NPRM acknowledges that these terms originated in specific historical contexts and were carried forward with consistent meaning through successive administrations precisely because they had established meanings in civil service law. Justia This admission directly contradicts the claim that these are not terms of art.

   Text sample: I am writing to challenge the NPRM's claim that "approximately 50,000 positions would be moved or transferred into Schedule Policy/Career, about two percent of the Federal civilian workforce." This estimate lacks credibility for several reasons:
I. Expanded Scope Compared to Previous Schedule F Proposal
The current NPRM significantly expands the criteria for positions that may be included in Schedule Policy/Career compared to the previous Schedule F proposal. While Executive Order 13957 already used broad language, this NPRM adds additional "guideposts" expanding the potential scope even further. Federal Register For example, the NPRM now explicitly includes:

All supervisors and higher-level managers of Schedule Policy/Career employees
Employees with "delegated or subdelegated authority" from agency heads
Anyone with "discretionary authority in agency grantmaking"
Anyone involved in "advocacy for administration policy"

   Text sample: The claim is these job categories relate to policy making. This makes no sense as both job areas are related to the technical evaluation of whether something is in accords with existing policies, not defining those policies themselves. Describing proposals and evaluating technical subjects requires high-level technical skill and is outside the skill area of political job roles since the persons in these roles change frequently and may not have any skills as to the relevant topics. The result is likely to poor performance and flaws in executing the desired policies. The existing separation between political and career jobs exists specifically in order to have people in these roles with the skills for the job, this proposed rule change will lead to chaos. Thus, Program officers at NIH, DOD, NSF, and other agencies should NOT become Schedule F Employees.

To begin with, Schedule F stands in stark contrast to the spirit and intent of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. This landmark legislation was designed to dismantle the patronage system and replace it with a fair, merit-driven approach to federal hiring. Reclassifying policy-related career roles under Schedule F would enable their dismissal without just cause, paving the way for politically driven personnel decisions. This undermines the essential nonpartisan nature of civil service as protected under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8), which explicitly calls for federal hiring and firing to be based on merit, not political affiliation.

First, if instances of political bias or insubordination among civil servants exist, there are already robust mechanisms in place to address such misconduct through the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), Office of Special Counsel (OSC), and agency-specific procedures under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Resorting to an across-the-board reclassification of policy-influencing positions to at-will status is an overly broad and legally questionable response.

While OPM asserts that these positions will remain ‚Äúcareer‚Äù and that their purpose is to reinforce accountability to the President, this distinction is ultimately unconvincing and fails to resolve core concerns about the erosion of the merit-based civil service.

First, labeling a position as ‚Äúcareer‚Äù while simultaneously making it subject to at-will dismissal based on subjective assessments of ‚Äúfaithful implementation‚Äù of a President‚Äôs agenda is a contradiction in terms. If these employees can be removed without the procedural protections afforded to others in the competitive service, then their career status is in name only. This change risks politicizing the federal workforce under the guise of neutrality, effectively chilling dissent and discouraging honest, evidence-based policy implementation.

OPM's belief that codifying the distinction between political loyalty and implementation fidelity will reduce ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù is optimistic at best.

   Text sample: Scientific inquiry is best informed by well-qualified experts in their field. Political appointees have neither the expertise nor experience to rank important biomedical grant applications. The people reviewing grants should be qualified by years of study, not by cozying up to officials.

It is a grave risk to let politics and policy goals affect what science can proceed and what is shut down. Ignoring the many advancements that have been made in seemingly unrelated studies that will be overlooked by an appointee, it risks the politicization of truth.

Our system should have, and has had, safeguards to prevent appointees from shutting down work that is counter to their beliefs. Indeed, it is at odds with the bad faith assertion that one goal is "viewpoint diversity" to suppress work that upholds a consensus, regardless of how politically unpopular. To boost topics that have repeatedly been proved to not be grounded in reality, such as a link between vaccination and autism, is to attack

   Text sample: As a citizen of the United States, I have serious concerns about both the legality and the political wisdom of this proposed rule. As it presently stands, I must strongly oppose its adoption. 

Legally speaking, the long and short of it is that the rule directly contravenes the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA). The CSRA lays out, in Schedule C, the list of federal employees who are exempt from standard civil protections; the list does not include career employees. For the executive branch to assert a unilateral privilege to reclassify employees, and strip them of those protections, constitutes a direct abrogation of standing law and a violation of the separation of powers. If there is a problem with the CSRA, requiring amendment or alteration, it is solely the province of Congress to address it. 

In fact, however, there is not a problem with the CSRA. The plain fact of the matter is that career civil service protections exist primarily to prevent partisan politics from overwhel

   Text sample: The proposed rule makes the false claims that:
"Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the DRAFTING OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENTS, EVALUATING OF GRANT APPLICATIONS, OR RECOMMENDING OR SELECTING GRANT RECIPIENTS."

and:
"Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so EMPLOYEES WITH A SUBSTANTIVE DISCRETIONARY ROLE MAY OCCUPY POLICYMAKING POSITIONS."

The claim is these job categories relate to policy making. This makes no sense as both job areas are related to the technical evaluation of whether something is in accords with existing policies, not defining those policies themselves. Describing proposals and evaluating technical subjects requires high-level technical skill and is outside the skill area of political job roles since the persons in these roles change frequently and may not have any skills as to the relevant topics.

The creation of Schedule Policy/Career is particularly concerning, as it is a direct challenge to the longstanding principle that civil servants should operate above the political fray, ensuring continuity and stability regardless of which party controls the White House.

Comment on Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the
Civil Service
Docket Number: OPM-2025-0004
This comment is submitted in response to OPM‚Äôs proposed rule, which asserts the goal
of improving performance, accountability, and responsiveness within the federal civil
service. The proposed changes claim to update and reinforce civil service practices, yet
they risk destabilizing a system that has long relied on clear, merit-based protections. In
addressing concerns over underperformance and the handling of problematic
employees, the proposal institutes a broad overhaul rather than implementing focused,
targeted reforms. A more specific set of reforms would promote accountability and
responsiveness while preserving the essential stability of the nonpartisan, merit-based
workforce.

   Text sample: I am firmly opposed to any effort to implement or reinstate the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees. Such a measure would erode the merit-based framework that has sustained a competent, impartial civil service for more than a century.

Schedule F represents a significant departure from the reforms introduced by the Pendleton Act of 1883, which was designed to dismantle the spoils system and promote merit-based hiring within the federal government. By reclassifying a broad segment of the career workforce‚Äîparticularly those involved in policy-related functions‚ÄîSchedule F would enable their removal without cause, inviting politically driven employment decisions. This runs counter to the principles laid out in 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8), which emphasize hiring and firing based on merit rather than political loyalty.

Additionally, the proposed criteria for inclusion under Schedule F are overly broad and imprecise, violating the due process rights established by 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 7513. Th

   Text sample: As friends and supporters of federal employees, we are submitting this comment to express concern about the proposed creation of Schedule Policy/Career and the harmful impact it may have on the career civil service.



We understand the goal of this rule is to promote accountability and responsiveness in government. However, we believe the rule as written is too broad and puts hard-working public servants at risk of losing their due process rights, even if their jobs have nothing to do with policy-making or political decision-making.



Many federal employees work in roles such as data analysis, public benefits processing, casework, training, operations, finance, HR, or technical program support. These are not policy positions. Yet we have heard troubling reports that entire lists of employees are being considered for reclassification under this new schedule‚Äîeven those whose work has nothing to do with shaping or influencing federal policy.

   Text sample: Thank you for reviewing these comments. Respectfully, this proposed rule making action should be rejected due to fundamental incompatibility with the enforcement architecture of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) and its disruption of the exclusive statutory framework governing performance and conduct-based adverse actions. I've outlined several reasons below why the proposed action is untenable for OPM to pursue further.

 * Nullification of Prohibited Personnel Practice (PPP) Enforcement: A cornerstone of the CSRA is the protection against PPPs (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2302(b)). For covered employees facing major adverse actions, the primary forum for vindicating these rights‚Äîparticularly challenging actions potentially based on political affiliation (¬ß 2302(b)(1)(E)), reprisal for whistleblowing (¬ß 2302(b)(8)), or reprisal for exercising appeal rights (¬ß 2302(b)(9))‚Äîis through an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) under Chapter 75.

Look at that great work we did, now the road is smooth. Except the bridge fails later because the right thing, the much more costly and time consuming thing was to replace its supports. Bandaids will only get us so far.

This rule is not only ill-conceived and contrary to the longstanding principles of a nonpartisan and merit-based civil service, but it also invites constitutional and statutory legal challenges that could destabilize government operations and undermine the public trust.

The Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), 5 U.S.C. sections 7501-7514 and 4301-4305, establishes the exclusive framework governing adverse actions and performance-based removals in federal employment. Congress enacted these provisions to balance efficiency in government operations with employee rights, explicitly ensuring that career employees are protected against arbitrary or politically motivated removals.

1. ‚ÄúPolicy-Influencing‚Äù Must Be More Clearly and Narrowly Defined
The proposed rule does not clearly define what constitutes a ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù position. This
ambiguity invites inconsistent application and risks politicizing a wide range of career roles that

implement policy, but do not set it. They are required to follow the lawful orders of their agency

decisions.

   Text sample: Dear Director Ahuja:

I write to raise serious concerns with the cost-benefit analysis accompanying OPM‚Äôs proposed rule to establish ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù in the excepted service. While this rule has been designated a ‚Äúsignificant regulatory action‚Äù under Executive Order 12866, its accompanying cost-benefit analysis does not meet the standards required for such actions.

1. Unbalanced and Speculative Benefit Estimates
The proposal suggests that the primary benefits of the rule stem from "increased accountability" and faster rulemaking due to improved employee performance. However, OPM acknowledges that it "does not have a reasonable basis for estimating the magnitude of these gains" and therefore does not quantify them‚Äã.

On its face, the initiative titled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù purports to promote government efficiency.

   Text sample: I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù (RIN 3206 AO80), which would create a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù excepted service classification. This proposed rule is deeply troubling for several reasons:

1. Undermining Merit System Principles
By reclassifying policy influencing positions as at will roles, this rule eviscerates long standing merit system protections. These positions would no longer be covered by Chapter 75 or 43 of Title 5, eliminating due process rights and appeal protections. Such a change opens the door to politically motivated dismissals, weakening the very fabric of a professional and impartial civil service, which is intended to serve the American people, not transient political agendas.

2. Politicization of the Career Civil Service
The proposed rule dangerously blurs the line between career and political appointees. Even if the rule claims to retain ‚Äúnonpartisan‚Äù hiring pract

I respectfully submit this comment to urge the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to
formally evaluate whether the proposed rule‚Äîestablishing a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù
within the excepted service‚Äîrequires review under the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA), 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 4321 et seq.
1. NEPA Applies to Major Federal Actions With Environmental Implications
NEPA requires federal agencies to determine whether proposed actions may directly, indirectly,
or cumulatively affect the human environment. While this rule does not involve land use or
physical development, it is a government-wide policy change that could significantly affect how
federal agencies carry out their missions‚Äîincluding agencies with direct responsibilities for
environmental protection, resource management, or permitting decisions.
As a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, this proposal may qualify as a
major federal actio

   Text sample: Schedule F could have a deeply negative impact on military retention by eroding trust in the civilian leadership and institutions that support and oversee the armed forces.

The U.S. military operates within a broader system of civilian-led governance, relying on experienced, nonpartisan professionals in agencies like the Department of Defense, State Department, and intelligence community. These civilian counterparts handle everything from logistics and planning to diplomacy and national security strategy. When those roles are filled based on political loyalty rather than merit, it undermines the professionalism and consistency that military personnel depend on.

Service members expect their leadership‚Äîcivilian and uniformed‚Äîto make decisions based on facts, expertise, and long-term strategic interests. If they see political interference replacing expertise, or if they perceive that loyalty to a political figure outweighs loyalty to the Constitution, it can seriously damage morale and

This rule is deeply concerning for several reasons, its serious legal and constitutional implications, its potential to politicize the career civil service and its unnecessary duplication of existing tools available to address poor performers. 

Despite the new name, this proposal is clearly a rebranded version of Schedule F. The new rule shares the same fundamental objective: to remove due process protections from career civil servants.  This structure is inconsistent with the values and protections established under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was designed to prevent the return of a patronage system and protect the merit-based, apolitical structure of the federal workforce. Although the proposed ruling states ‚ÄúPatronage Remains Prohibited‚Äù; without due process there is no practical way for employees, the public or oversight bodies to verify that dismissal

Dear Director Ahuja:
I write to express strong opposition to the proposed rule establishing ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù
within the excepted service. In addition to the well-documented violations of the Administrative
Procedure Act and constitutional concerns, this proposal raises a range of operational, policy,
and workforce integrity issues that have not been adequately addressed in the rulemaking
record.
1. Vague Definition of ‚ÄúPolicy-Influencing‚Äù
The proposed rule does not clearly define what constitutes a ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù position. This
lack of precision invites inconsistent application across agencies, encourages subjective and
potentially political decision-making, and could result in the misclassification of technical,
analytical, or support roles that do not meaningfully shape policy. Without a clear standard, the
rule cannot be fairly or predictably implemented.
2. Absence of Safeguards Against Political Abu

So help me God."

   Text sample: As per NGA.STND.0036, the Department of Defense is required to maintain WGS 84, the best global geodetic reference system for the Earth available at this time for practical applications of mapping, charting, geopositioning, and navigation. Currently the Joint Chiefs of Staff for Intelligence (J2) are working to codify the importance of WGS 84 for global safety of navigation and national security in a letter to be published later this year.

Since the construction and maintenance of WGS 84 is explicitly defined in several government standards and Standard Implementation Guidance (SIG) documents, there is no ability for NGA employees to make political decisions to impact this key governmental product.

OPM-2025-0004-0001 in its current format makes no mention of an exemption for analysts working the WGS 84 mission and workers would in fact likely be caught up in the definition ‚Äúbeing held accountable for the success of one or more specific programs or projects‚Äù.

   Text sample: I object to the proposed regulation and the underlying executive order. While accountability in the civil service is a desirable end, this rule goes too far in granting personal discretion to Executive Branch leadership. By stretching the application of "policy-making" and "policy-advocating" from the Civil Service Reform Act beyond their established interpretation, it creates a vague category that can encompass almost any white-collar employee and effectively nullifies civil service protections enshrined in law by Congress. Our democratic freedoms depend on the rule of law--that government officials are fundamentally bound and guided by written standards enacted through the people's representatives. If the civil service needs to be made more accountable, it should be through legislation, not a creative reinterpretation that reverses the force of the law as written. In general, this kind of regulation erodes the accountability of the Executive Branch to implement the will of the people

   Text sample: I strongly oppose any implementation or revival of the 'Schedule F' classification for federal employees. This proposal fundamentally endangers the merit-based civil service system that has been the foundation of a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for more than a century.

The creation of Schedule F directly contradicts the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was established to eliminate patronage and create merit-based hiring processes. By allowing potentially tens of thousands of career civil servants with policy responsibilities to be reclassified and dismissed without established cause, Schedule F would effectively reintroduce a political spoils system. This contradicts the core principle of an apolitical civil service codified in 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8), which requires federal employment decisions to be based on qualifications and protected from political influence.

The broad and ambiguous criteria for Schedule F designation would circumvent the due process

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has proposed a rule that would allow the
President, upon OPM‚Äôs recommendation, to reclassify certain career civil servants into a new
‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career.‚Äù These employees would be stripped of statutory adverse action
protections and placed in at-will positions. The proposed rule is unsupported by rigorous data,
lacks a credible cost-benefit analysis, and fails to consider less extreme alternatives that could
achieve accountability while preserving constitutional and statutory safeguards.
I. Deficient Empirical Justification
OPM‚Äôs justification for the proposed rule rests on anecdotal supervisor perceptions and isolated
historical references. It asserts, without providing systematic evidence, that adverse action
procedures under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 4303 and 7513 ‚Äúmake it very difficult‚Äù to remove poor performers
or those who ‚Äúsubvert Presidential directives‚Äù (90 FR at 17182‚Äì17183).

   Text sample: Having worked with state government for most of my career, I know how disruptive a new governor is to getting work done. New agency secretaries replace the upper level management working with them, and those people then have to learn how their agency works from the career service employees who have been there for years and have the institutional knowledge on how to keep everything running smoothly. Those who choose to ignore career employees end up making bad decisions that cost the state a lot of money. 
The federal government is no different. If career employees are replaced by loyalists each time there is a new president, then you no longer have people with the knowledge to  keep the agencies running smoothly during a transition. And you have nobody willing to tell the new agency leaders how things should work due to fear of being fired, thus allowing them to make costly mistakes that prevent the agency from serving the public. Without job security, people will have no reason to sta

   Text sample: The past few months at NIH and NSF preview how politicized scientific agencies would operate. Funding choices that reflected the consensus of some of the best scientists in the world were reversed by nonscientists. Program officers have, at points, been told not to communicate with the scientific community or have had their engagement limited. Scientific agencies have been directed to effectively reduce the flow of funds to a trickle by adding new layers of redundant review and red tape and even violating court orders to reinstate cancelled grants.

Other agencies, including regulatory agencies, apply rather than fund basic science, but the risks of politicization are no less. How confident can Americans be that federal employees will not have to choose between their job and scientific values in areas such as climate change, food safety, extreme weather forecasting, or public health?

This is best accomplished by a strong civil service program, as it ensures that the people in positions are qualified, that hires are merit-based instead of "who you know" -based, and that employees will continue doing their jobs no matter who is elected.

The current civil service rules allow narrow and appropriate exceptions to ensure that elected officials can appoint leaders to implement their policies. The proposed changes are unnecessary and will harm the competence and efficiency of crucial federal agencies.

I oppose the proposed rulemaking, and specifically oppose:

Public service roles need stability, not just for the people in those roles but for the communities and ecosystems their work supports. Turning these positions into at-will jobs could lead to a loss of institutional knowledge, erode public trust, and discourage qualified people from entering or staying in government roles.

   Text sample: I strongly object to OPM's proposed plan to use the "Schedule F" classification for federal workers. This plan jeopardizes the civil service system's foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit.

OMB Director Russell Vought is the fascist architect of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.  His objective is to achieve the Heritage Foundation's fascist goals by twisting the entire federal government into an unaccountable, partisan, authoritarian tool of oppression for Donald Trump and Trump's accomplices.

Vought and his fascist cabal have already harmed my business in Massachusetts by kneecapping and politicizing federal agencies - in particular, the National Science Foundation (NSF).  I am proposing an NSF project for technology that would promote energy independence in the U.S., reduce pollution, and save Americans billions of dollars in energy costs over the next 10 years.

I am a long-retired (20 years) Federal employee who was a GS-15 Division Director in HHS with responsibility for leading budget preparation and execution; personnel; logistics, and IT for case data collection, analysis and evaluation. I served under political Office Directors of both parties and was, based on evaluations and personal relationships with Schedule C leaders, considered to be a highly valued, responsible, responsive and trusted resource and colleague regardless of the political party affiliation of the Schedule C appointee. If I were in that position today, I can reasonably assume that I'd be included in the proposed Schedule F excepted ("at will") service

   Text sample: I remain hopeful that at some point in the future, we will elect a President who values the critical work that the government does to intercede in those areas of public life in which private industry either cannot be trusted or cannot be bothered to do the right thing - affordable housing, climate resilience, regular and special education, air and water safety, nuclear power, healthcare for those of us who need a high level of care, consumer safety, financial protection, to name just a tiny fraction - instead of one whose primary motivation and mission as a public servant is to strip the country for parts and leave it sitting on blocks in the front yard. 

Adopting Schedule F would further that cynical and destructive mission by allowing the President to empty out the public service of those dedicated, knowledgeable individuals who have built careers on building a better America and replace them with unqualified cronies and sycophants whose loyalty is to a single person, and emphatical

It also states that:

"the President will make the final decision about which positions go into Schedule Policy/Career." 

And "guidance about positions agencies should consider in their Schedule Policy/Career positions" includes those with:

"Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions."

   Text sample: I am 100% against the drive to increase the implementation of Schedule F hires rendering our civilian agencies completely bound to political dogma, or else. We need civil servants to be warriors for democracy, in their hearts, not autocracy & cronyism. Merit-based, only, putting skill & experience before ANY party affiliation, period.

I quote AI's definition: "Schedule F employees are federal civil servants reclassified into a new category called the "excepted service". This reclassification, initiated by former President Trump through an Executive Order, aims to give the executive branch more flexibility in hiring and firing, especially for those in policy-making positions. Essentially, it reduces the civil service protections these employees have, making them easier to remove from their positions"

The changes would reduce substantive accountability and facilitate the hiring or firing of federal employees for improper partisan reasons.  It is essential that we have a deep bench of nonpartisan and apolitical subject matter experts, and that we keep employees based on their expertise and performance, and not their willingness to change their views and substantive work based on who won the most recent elections.  For example, during the Iran-Contra War, there were serious charges that intelligence analysts skewed their conclusions to tell DOD and other policymakers what they wanted to hear rather than what they needed to hear to accurately assess the risk to our troops and those of our allies.

   Text sample: I oppose the proposed changes because they would politicize the civil service, centralize more power in the President, result in unstable government policy and degrade the skill level of individuals who want to devote their careers to serving their government.

The real purpose behind the proposed rule is to make it easier for a sitting President to replace civil servants with whom he may or may not agree and install his own appointees.  For 145 years, our government has been peopled by those dedicated to public service.  They understand that they are hired to implement the law and the policies of the current President.  It is for this reason that there already are 4,000 political appointees in every agency of the government.  There is no need for additional political appointees.  

The ability of the President to effectively remove civil service protections to potentially thousands more will make government service far less desirable.  If an employee can lose his or her job simply by

   Text sample: Federal workers have repeatedly expressed their frustration with the current administration, but they have not done the honorable thing - they have not resigned. If they truly believe that the work they are being asked to do is so unconstitutional, so despicable, then why do they refuse to leave? Why stay, except to undermine the democratically elected President of the United States, to actively harm the agenda voted in by the American people? Federal workers don't get to systemically erode their country over their own niche politics, especially not after swearing an oath to the Constitution.

Worse, still, are those who choose to do nothing at all except twiddle their thumbs and collect their paycheck, because they know that they can't be fired. That's no way to run an executive branch, a branch that is ultimately reflective of the Executive himself - the President. There needs to be a way to fire those who refuse to do their jobs. 

It's a simple premise, but one many in these commen

   Text sample: The proposed rule titled "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" by the Personnel Management Office, while ostensibly aimed at enhancing government efficiency, poses a significant threat to the nonpartisan integrity and institutional memory of the civil service. Civil servants are intended to be career professionals who serve across multiple administrations, providing continuity, stability, and deep expertise that transcends shifting political agendas. Undermining this continuity‚Äîpotentially through easier dismissal procedures or politically influenced performance evaluations‚Äîrisks transforming the civil service into a politicized workforce, vulnerable to partisan turnover and pressure. This would erode the technical competence and long-term policy knowledge that the civil service uniquely provides, replacing experienced professionals with ideologically aligned but less qualified individuals.

Furthermore, the civil service was deliberately struc

   Text sample: From day one, the Trump administration and Elon Musk have set out to punish federal employees in unprecedented and illegal ways. From attempting to disregard federal employees‚Äô union rights to initiating mass layoffs and placing other employees on administrative leave to halt the work of their agencies, they have tried to take a hacksaw to important government services and the people who provide them. And this is no surprise ‚Äì Trump‚Äôs head of the government operations agency, Russell Vought, also the architect of  the right-wing policy playbook Project 2025, once said he wanted federal employees to be ‚Äúput in trauma.‚Äù 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is now proposing a new regulation that would allow the Trump administration to designate as many as 50,000 federal employees under a new classification that would allow them to be fired with no rights to appeal, including for political reasons.

   Text sample: I am submitting these comments in opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed regulation ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career.‚Äù  The proposed rule undermines more than 140 years of civil service reform following the spoils system. It opens the door to politically motivated firings and tramples on employees‚Äô constitutional and statutory rights.  Moreover, the proposed regulation to dismantle civil service protections destabilizes the career workforce, politicizes the day- to- day work of government, and erodes the very idea of a professional, independent civil service.  Specific concerns are presented below.

2. I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee's belief that the employee has failed to "faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability," as required under the proposed amendment to Sec. 213.3501(b).

   Text sample: I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed rule, which seeks to alter the civil service framework in a way that disproportionately targets higher-level career civil servants. While I support the idea that federal employees‚Äîat all levels‚Äîshould be held accountable and that ineffective performers should be easier to remove, this rule treats the symptoms rather than addressing the root causes of performance issues across government.

The proposal‚Äôs focus on senior career staff creates a chilling effect that will undermine agency effectiveness. Making experienced professionals fear political retaliation or being scapegoated for fulfilling their duties will not foster accountability or improved performance. Instead, it risks weakening institutional knowledge, diminishing employee morale, and ultimately degrading the performance and responsiveness of federal agencies.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose any effort to reinstate or expand Schedule F Policy/Career Schedule within the federal workforce. Doing so would reverse nearly a century and a half of progress made to ensure the U.S. civil service operates based on merit, not political allegiance.
The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 was enacted in direct response to the corruption of the ‚Äúspoils system,‚Äù in which federal jobs were awarded based on political connections rather than qualifications. That system bred inefficiency, nepotism, and public distrust. The Pendleton Act established that federal employee should be hired and promoted based on competitive examinations and professional qualifications‚Äînot loyalty to elected officials or parties. The tipping point came in 1881 when Charles Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker believed he was owed a patronage position. The public backlash was intense, creating political pressure for reform.

   Text sample: Government services are disrupted if there is the possibility that many positions can be replaced with each new administration - this does not serve the public well. Already my family has been impacted dramatically by reduced staffing in 2025 (at Social Security offices, which impact my disabled family member and at National Institutes of Health, which has seen massive delays for research funding, which disrupts the lives of the scientists I work with). Increasing staff turnover also raises the costs for the taxpayer via extra recruiting, onboarding, and offboarding costs. This is a very wasteful use of taxpayer money.

Our country is great because its citizens have a mixture of beliefs and values relating to public policy.

The reason we have a professional civil service is because it used to be a political payoff and was corrupt and ineffective.

2) Civil servants should be well qualified in their fields. This requires work experience gained in years of practice in their field. They should not be randomly hired or fired because they worked on someone's campaign.

3)At the present moment, there are grotesquely unqualified people heading government agencies. Not a single one of them would have been able to pass a test or likely a security clearance that a normal civil servant would have to pass.

People may complain about specific instances in which this agency or that, or a particular government worker or another seemed inefficient or unresponsive.  Of course this is occasionally going to occur when each year consists of millions of interactions between the public and the federal workforce.  But to blow the frequency of unsatisfactory interactions out of proportion and, furthermore, pretend that more political appointees could improve the public‚Äôs experience is ludicrous.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed changes outlined in "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service." While the proposal claims to enhance efficiency, it will have serious detrimental effects on the functioning of our civil service.

The rule would foster a counterproductive culture of fear among civil servants. When employees operate under constant threat of punitive action, they become risk-averse. Under this rule, crucially important viewpoints as well as valuable mechanisms for problem solving will become incompatible with employee survival and advancement.

The proposal overlooks numerous unintended consequences. Civil servants may prioritize short-term metrics over long-term public benefit, avoid necessary but politically sensitive work, and experience decreased morale and increased turnover‚Äîultimately undermining the very performance improvements sought.

Most concerning is that these changes are fundamentally incompatible with democratic governance

   Text sample: Executive Order 13957 outlines a process for revoking civil service protections for certain federal workers who traditionally discharge their responsibilities consistent with the priorities of the administration in office.

The proposed rule claims that employees in this category will not have to ‚Äúpersonally or politically support the president.‚Äù However, that assertion seems dubious. Just last week, the Office of Special Counsel, an independent watchdog agency whose previous head was fired by Trump in February, reinstated a 2020 advisory opinion that allows civil servants to wear or display swag (like a MAGA hat) overtly supportive of an incumbent officeholder, while continuing to prohibit such partisan displays on behalf of candidates for office - a distinction that is overtly in opposition of the Hatch Act. Moreover, Trump has shown little tolerance for any hint of political disloyalty, hesitation about policy agendas, or questioning of legality of administration actions. Trump even

   Text sample: The big red flag in this proposed rule is right up front, in black and white: "This will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who...undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives."  This language is a sham, created to allow the firing, without appeal or legal recourse, of federal employees, not legitimate reasons of misconduct or poor job performance, but for objecting to presidential directives.  

It is the responsibility of federal employees to carry out the non-partisan missions of their respective agencies for the greater good of the American public.  Each one takes an oath to uphold the Constitution of the U.S. 

What if the "presidential directives" critically undermine the missions of the federal agencies these workers are employed by?

   Text sample: Dear Office of Personnel Management,
I‚Äôm writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004-0001). Reintroducing a version of Schedule F‚Äînow rebranded ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù‚Äîis a bad idea that defies ‚Äòcommonsense‚Äô and puts the effectiveness, efficiency, and neutrality of our government at risk.

1. Politicizing jobs defies efficiency. Government civil-service jobs should be filled based on qualifications, not politics. Turning thousands of policy-related roles into at-will positions undermines this principle and therefore undermines service delivery for the American people. A 2023 University College London Policy Lab study found that politicized public workforces are less efficient, more corrupt, and deliver worse results which goes against the efficiency and delivery this administration claims to stand for. Brookings (2020) similarly warned that removing merit protections opens the do

I vehemently oppose the reclassification of civil servants to be political appointees; therefore, I ask for rejection of this rule change. The change is patently politically-motivated and has been brought forth with vile intent that will undermine the ability of the government to carry out publicly-driven, mission-related mandates across virtually every agency. The current administration has put forth this rule simply to disrupt a functioning government in ways that will serve their personal interests. 

This proposed rules change is a bold-faced attempt to permanently cripple the American government. The intent of the rule is antithetical to a smooth running, non-partisan civil service ‚Äì a service that prior to this administration has enjoyed for decades the well-earned respect of Americans across the political spectrum.

   Text sample: Our country has had a federal civil service with civil service protections since the Pendleton Act of 1883.

   Text sample: As a developmental scientist and early-career researcher whose work depends on the integrity of federal scientific agencies, I am deeply concerned about the proposed reinstatement and expansion of Schedule F. Reclassifying tens of thousands of career civil servants as political appointees undermines the expertise, independence, and continuity that agencies like NIH and NSF require to function effectively.

This policy is especially troubling given how it targets positions fundamental to the grantmaking process‚Äîroles that demand scientific judgment, not political alignment. If implemented, Schedule F would compromise the peer review process, chill open scientific discourse, and drive skilled public servants out of government.

My field relies on public science infrastructure that has, until now, been grounded in merit and accountability‚Äînot ideology. Politicizing these systems would erode public trust and set back progress in areas ranging from autism research to public health.

   Text sample: Federal regulation and policymaking affect many aspects of our lives and every corner of our economy. Federal employees in policy-influencing roles can hone their skills and discharge their duties most faithfully to congressional intent and statutory purpose if they are free from political pressure.

Civil service employees within the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) develop industry-specific expertise, deep knowledge of workplace hazards, and an institutional understanding of the scope and demands of health- and safety-related law and policy.

The Trump administration‚Äôs push to expand at-will employment through the so-called ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù rule is not about efficiency or accountability. It is a blatant power grab cloaked in bureaucratic language. Simply put: this proposal would breed a system with racist, anti-worker roots and repurpose it for authoritarian ends‚Äîand it is being forced into existence by Trump himself, pressuring the Office of Personnel Management to carry out his political agenda under the pretense of civil service reform.

I want to clarify my prior comment from today (5/14/25). I urge support for the legislation currently in Congress to block Executive Order 14171 and any future implementation of Schedule F or similar policies.

Here's why:
President Grant established the first U.S. Civil Service Commission in 1871, a precursor to the modern agency. This commission was a significant step towards reforming the federal government by moving away from the "spoils system" where political appointments were common.
Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. The Pendleton Act, signed into law in 1883, formally established the U.S. Civil Service Commission as a truly independent agency. This Act marked a major shift towards a merit-based civil service, moving away from political patronage.
While not a direct codification of the independent civil service, Rule F, issued in 1910, played a significant role in shaping the civil service in

The changes, if enacted, would represent systemic change to government organizations that all Americans depend on, and are critical to our public health, security and economy. I don‚Äôt want a political appointee forecasting (or perhaps ignoring) storm models, when I take my family on vacation. The same applies for all the agencies.

Comments on Proposed Rule: Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness
in the Civil Service
Office of Personnel Management
Docket # OPM-2025-004
RIN: 3206-AO80
Dear Office of Personnel Management,
I am submitting comments on the Proposed Rule: Improving Performance, Accountability
and Responsiveness in the Civil Service, Docket # OPM-2025-004, RIN: 3206-AO80.
While I support holding federal employees accountable who do not meet their

   Text sample: Our non-partisan civil service is one of the strengths of our government. Without undue political pressures, our public servants are best able to focus on the demands of their work, be it protecting the public's health, finding the next cure for disease, supporting our farmers, or otherwise pursuing the work for which they have the requisite training and experience. Political appointees are subject to the directives/whims of the current administration, whatever party it might be... and these directives/whims come and go while good science, law, and other critical work depend on stability and focus over time. Accountability in the civil service already exists, as well as mechanisms to ensure performance. The past few weeks of the current administration have already made abundantly clear the damage that can be done to essential public services by political appointees who lack the requisite knowledge and depth of experience to make decisions in the best interest of the American people.

   Text sample: While on its face, the proposal seems to check all the boxes of a regular job position one might find in the free job market.  And on those merits, I see how someone may accept these terms as legitimate.

However, government jobs are NOT regular jobs.  As this document states, they are in danger of political control.  While it claims to bring fairness to the OPM, it does the opposite.  There is broad control at the management level to ensure the correct politically aligned applicants are hired/retained.  To put it more clearly, if you are not a republican, you may not get a job.  These positions should be held by a cross-sampling of Americans.  And half of America is democrat or left-leaning.  This rule could be used to ensure Trump supporters only get hired, which is discrimination.

The verbiage in this document does not add any protections for the employee, and an employee's rights in the commercial market are guaranteed under law.  This document states that, based on judgment by su

   Text sample: I write in strong support of the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs proposed rule to establish Schedule Policy/Career, as directed by Executive Order 14171. This rule represents a necessary reform to ensure that career officials in policy-influencing roles are held to appropriate performance expectations and can be managed in a way that supports effective, democratic governance.
Federal agencies today face significant challenges when it comes to managing performance in high-impact policy positions. The existing adverse action procedures under Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5 are often slow, burdensome, and legally ambiguous. As a result, agency leaders are frequently deterred from taking timely and necessary personnel actions, even when performance clearly falls short of expectations.
This rule would remove those barriers for a narrowly defined category of positions‚Äîcareer roles with policy-influencing responsibilities. These roles have a direct impact on the development and execution of th

   Text sample: The Pendleton Act of 1883 and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 created a professional civil service to insure that U.S. government employees would be protected against arbitrary removal or demotion for political reasons, as had previously been the case. Those acts together, but especially the latter, led to the establishment of a professional, nonpartisan and highly trained and competent and career civil service whose fidelity and loyalty was pledged to the Constitution rather than to a president or a political party. Enactment of the proposed ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù rule would roll back traditional and important protections for government employees in favor of a return to the spoils system that led to the passing of the Pendleton Act.

The Detrimental Effects of the Proposed Rule on Civil Service Performance and Accountability
1. Introduction: The Perils of Politicizing the Civil Service
The proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on April 23, 2025 1, seeks to implement Executive Order 14171 and establish a new personnel category known as Schedule Policy/Career within the civil service. The stated aim is to enhance performance, accountability, and responsiveness within the federal workforce.1 However, this initiative, which reinstates and amends the previous Schedule F executive order 2, presents a significant threat to the foundational principles of a merit-based, nonpartisan civil service. This report argues against the implementation of this rule, asserting that it undermines the established merit system, erodes job security for dedicated career professionals, risks increased politicization and a decline in government effectiveness

   Text sample: While the goal of improving performance, accountability, and responsiveness in the civil service is commendable, the proposed reforms often overlook the unique challenges faced by veterans transitioning into federal employment. Many policies fail to address systemic inefficiencies that disproportionately hinder veterans, despite their proven leadership and technical skills. Here‚Äôs why the current approach falls short:  

1. Veterans Face Structural Barriers to Performance
Civil service reforms frequently emphasize "performance metrics" without acknowledging bureaucratic hurdles that stifle veterans‚Äô productivity. Lengthy security clearance delays, redundant training programs, and inflexible hierarchies often prevent veterans from applying their expertise effectively. Without addressing these inefficiencies, performance improvements remain theoretical.  

2. Accountability Measures Ignore Agency Failures
Accountability is often framed as an individual issue, but veterans encounter syste

   Comment IDs: OPM-2025-0004-1125
   Text sample: I firmly oppose the implementation or revival of the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees. This proposal poses a direct threat to the merit-based civil service system that has safeguarded a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.

Schedule F undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was designed to end the spoils system by establishing merit-based hiring. Reclassifying a broad group of policy-related civil servants to make them easily terminable without cause invites politically motivated employment decisions. This contradicts the core principle of an apolitical civil service, as outlined in 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8), which requires federal employment to be based on merit, not politics.

The proposal also violates due process protections under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 7513, which ensures cause-based removals and procedural safeguards for career employees. Removing these protections for thousands of workers would erode accountability, silence ex

   Text sample: I am opposed to these rule changes.

Years ago, I worked as a lawyer in the State of Alaska Department of Law tasked with representing various Executive Branch agencies and their employees. Most of these state employees were in the so-called "classified service," given civil service protections, and thus could not be fired or disciplined except for due cause.  Any number of times I experienced members of the Legislature or political appointees in the Executive Branch directly or indirectly pressuring classified employees who were faithful to their jobs but had raised the hackles of some well-connected business or wealthy campaign donor. Civil service protections helped to insulate these employees so that they could feel free to act in the public's interest without fear of losing their job, receiving an unfair evaluation, a demotion, and so on.

   Text sample: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ensures the safety of our food and pharmaceutical supply, and effective policy and regulation in both areas depend on deeply informed expertise backed by strong science. In the first Trump administration, with full civil service protections in place for career employees, the FDA‚Äôs science-based research and approval process for COVID-19 vaccines moved on a remarkably fast track and saved untold numbers of lives. But swapping highly skilled nonpartisan civil servants with people chosen largely based on political alignment threatens the nation‚Äôs ability to respond quickly and effectively to the next pandemic or other crises.

That was before all the unqualified appointees of the current administration were sworn in. Making significantly more positions accountable to the sitting president would cause chaos, as highly qualified, knowledgeable and experienced employees are replaced by people off the street with no knowledge or experience. Agencies will become much less capable of meeting their missions. This will result in financial loss to the government as well. Civil service policies must remain merit based and not sabotaged as this proposed regulation would do.

It is ultimately up to senior policymakers to make policy decisions.  However, it is incumbent upon career civil servants in Executive agencies to provide their best advice to these policymakers.

   Text sample: I am a scientist, currently employed by a large pharmaceutical company in the private sector. My comment pertains to the supplementary information on page 17187 under the heading 2. Executive Order 14171 - "Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking‚Ä¶" Having political appointees made responsible for grantmaking decisions for scientific grants will be extremely harmful for scientific progress. As an example, in the USSR in the 1930s, science became highly politicized, and only Lysenko's views on biology were allowed.  Because of this, the USSR became a backwater in biological research.  In contrast, the US system based on peer review and scientific merit, until very recently, made the US the premier place to be a scientist, with great minds from many countries flocking here. By making grant and funding decisions based on political orthodoxy rather than science into politics, we will turn our vibrant scientific ecosystem into a backwater. The president an

   Text sample: This rule change should not be adopted. While reasons for not adopting this rule change are many, my comment will focus on one major point. This proposed rule change will allow for immediate dismissal of federal employees that are involved in "policymaking". The rule change also stipulates that "policymaking" includes "grantmaking". Though the rule change states that appointments to fill positions dismissed through this rule will be nonpartisan, there is nothing stopping every new administration from dismissing large swathes of federal employees involved in crafting funding opportunities and selecting grant recipients based on political ideology.

I believe that this rule will greatly harm the longitudinal, institutional knowledge within the federal workforce by increasing the turnover of career employees (who generally earn less money than the private sector to contribute to our country). Further, frequent and swift changes in agency priorities (such as is happening now) greatly harms

   Text sample: I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule due to the following:

Politicization: Schedule Policy/Career could lead to the politicization of the federal statistical workforce. Official federal statistics clearly influence public policy of all sorts: monetary, fiscal, regulatory, etc. Thus, a President could classify many statistical agency positions as Policy/Career. Then, for example, Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äô leaders could be fired for releasing or planning to release jobs or inflation statistics unfavorable to the President‚Äôs policy agenda.

   Text sample: I'm a federal employee who could be reclassified into Schedule Policy/Career and I strongly oppose this rulemaking.

   Text sample: As a retired federal employee, I must speak out against the changes you are proposing. It has ALWAYS been that federal employees are to first protect and defend our constitution and, as an afterthought, be obedient to the president. In this particular president's first 110 days, he has on numerous occasions violated the constitution that I swore an oath to uphold. His disdain for the rule of law can be attested to by the fact that he has been found guilty of 34 felony counts and has, in the short time he has been in office (this time), has illegally ordered federal employees to break the law. It is very clear that President Trump is not of moral character to lead this nation, nor does he have the character to run our civil service. The only reason this change is being proposed is because the sycophants fear this dictator.

   Text sample: This rule will result in politicization of civil service. It would eliminate merit-based civil service protections for thousands of federal employees by reclassifying them. It will allow the removal of employees in policy-influencing roles without the standard procedural safeguards, enable the replacement of career civil servants with individuals selected based on political loyalty rather than expertise. This shift threatens the nonpartisan nature of the federal civil servants. The politicization of the civil service will erode public trust in federal agencies, as decisions may be viewed as politically motivated rather than based on objective analysis and the public interest. This rule will compromise the independence of federal agencies by subjecting employees to political pressures, thereby undermining their ability to provide unbiased and expert advice. The reclassification of positions and the removal of established protections may conflict with existing laws designed to ensure a m

   Text sample: Introduction
As a citizen who values representative government and nonpartisan civil service, I am deeply concerned about the proposed reimplementation of Schedule F. I believe this action would harm the functioning of our federal government, silence vital internal dissent, and jeopardize democratic norms that ensure agencies work in service to the American people‚Äînot to any one individual or administration.

Background
This comment addresses the potential reclassification of federal civil servants under a new ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù category, which would remove established merit-based protections for policy-influencing positions and allow for broad, discretionary dismissal of career professionals.

Analysis
Removing civil service protections from thousands of federal employees risks turning our professional bureaucracy into a political tool. Independent agencies function best when staffed by individuals selected for their expertise, not their political alignment. Schedule F would open the door t

 Titled; Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service would be a huge mistake.  
As proposed the rule would significantly reduce the quality of our government workforce by making civil service positions more difficult to fill with qualified, dedicated public servants. Our nation faces many complex, difficult problems which requires day-to-day management by individuals with significant expertise. The proposed changes would make it more difficult to compete for talented people who would have little job security.  This competition would require higher salaries to attract the same level of talent.  
An alternative response from the US government would be to settle for less qualified personnel within their available salary structure.  This situation plays out in many states were government employees are poorly paid.  Such emp

My name is Corina Logan and my comment is regarding the Proposed Rule ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025) Docket ID (OPM-2025-0004) and RIN (3206-AO80). I am OPPOSED to this Proposed Rule.

   Text sample: As a retired federal government employee, I agree that it is way too difficult to fire under-performing employees after their probationary period has ended. However, I believe there are more equitable ways to address this concern. The administration's argument for this particular change actually makes the counterargument, in my opinion. Their premise is the positions in question shouldn't be partisan and should be wholly obedient to the President. They reference examples of career employees refusing to enact Trump executive orders they disagree with. However, they don't mention that these dedicated individuals are simply refusing to break the law and are adhering to their oath to support and defend the Constitution. In virtually every case this occurs, the executive branch is performing overreach. This has been confirmed by the consistent losses the executive branch has encountered in court cases brought against them. The Trump administration wishes for all career P/C employees to be a

   Text sample: This healthcare oversight office (CMS/CLIA) has grown quite complex over time. Right now, it's set up with one person in charge and five separate teams. Each team has its own manager and advisor, plus 10-14 staff members for each team. These teams handle different tasks like budget, working with states, creating rules, enforcing those rules, and conducting inspections.
The current setup has a lot of overlap, with multiple high-ranking positions doing similar work. Some of this work can be performed within the group division. A better approach might be streamlining everything into one unified team under a single leader. This would help everyone work together more efficiently, keeping the focus on making sure medical test results are accurate and safe for patients.
For this to work well, it's important to bring in people who really know their stuff‚Äîprofessionals with hands-on experience in medical laboratory work. Their practical knowledge would be incredibly valuable in ensuring that la

   Comment IDs: OPM-2025-0004-11580
   Text sample: While the proposed regulations go into great detail of the history of the civil service and the various civil service protections, the regulation does not explain adequately what has changed. Schedule F was never put into regulation. However, regulations were changed through 89 FR 24982 to restrict the definition of positions that should be excepted service to those that are politically appointed. As established law, it is now necessary to explain what situation has changed between April 2024 and the present that renders the now-established regulations inappropriate. 

The regulation justifies actions because of a change in administrative policy. We have a President, not a King. If a change in administration were in and of itself adequate authority to overturn regulations, regulations would have no meaning. The government is prevented by the Administrative Procedures Act from undertaking arbitrary and capricious actions, and so rule making must be motivated by more than one President‚Äôs

Science, by its very nature, must remain nonpartisan and rooted in empirical evidence, rigorous peer review, and long-term perspective.

This creates an environment in which critical research on public health, education, the environment, and innovation could be manipulated‚Äîor suppressed entirely‚Äîto fit transient political agendas rather than serving the public interest.

Studies show that politicization of public services generally worsens public-sector outcomes. Public employees invest less in developing their expertise and become more likely to exit. Instability and lack of experience reduce organizational performance. Politicization increases the influence of more ideologically radical appointees relative to more moderate civil servants. Politicization also reduces accountability. Bureaucrats worried about being fired fail to share less-than-desirable information with their political bosses and become less likely to respond to congressional oversight. As politicization begets lower transparency and administrative capacity, it increases waste and inefficiency.

Competent and responsible government work is vital for the health of our country and its citizens. Firing 50,000 federal employees will tragically wound the trust that Americans have in the

Research‚Äîparticularly in areas such as child mental health, trauma recovery, and developmental outcomes‚Äîrequires scientific independence to produce credible, peer-reviewed evidence that informs real-world interventions.

   Text sample: Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004

I strongly oppose the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed rule OPM-2025-0004-0001, which would reclassify approximately 50,000 federal employees into a newly created Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) category. This proposal effectively revives the rescinded Schedule F and threatens to dismantle the merit-based, nonpartisan civil service that has served our nation with competence, continuity, and integrity for over a century.

Eroding of Merit-Based Protections

The federal civil service was designed to ensure that hiring and retention decisions are based on merit, experience, and performance‚Äînot political affiliation or loyalty. The proposed Schedule P/C classification would allow for the removal of civil servants without cause, eliminating long-standing protections against arbitrary dismissal. This change undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and risks creating a federal workforce subject to political pressure rather than professional standar

I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to create a new "Schedule Policy/Career" in the excepted service. While I support efforts to ensure accountability and uphold high standards of conduct within the federal workforce, this proposal undermines long-standing civil service protections and risks politicizing positions that should remain nonpartisan.

This rule would allow agencies to remove career employees in policy-influencing roles without the due process protections currently guaranteed under Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5, including the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Stripping these procedural safeguards from career employees not only weakens the merit-based foundation of the civil service, but also exposes these positions to politicized removals and retaliation.

   Text sample: I am a Fed and I support this rule. As Federal employees we answer to the American people, and that means we have to report to the President and his agency heads. The current system makes it almost impossible to fire tenured Feds, and that is a problem if America is supposed to be a democracy with government by consent of the governed. There has to be accountability if someone is bad at their jobs. Right now there is very little. 

Also, I think the arguments other commenters have made about this rule hurting recruitment are silly. You don't become a Fed because you want to be impossible to fire if you do a bad job. You do it because you want to serve your country and the pay and benefits are decent. I've never heard a fellow Fed say they joined the government because they wanted civil service protections. It just isn't that big a deal. 

I'm not the only one who thinks that either.  The Congressional Budget Office just estimated that three-quarters of newly hired Feds would give up th

   Text sample: These changes would be categorically damaging to the democratic structure of our government, and would enhance the burden experienced by US citizens across countless domains. The current administration has already demonstrated how increased power of the executive branch to have political appointees enact a political agenda has led to more time, monetary, logistical, and emotional burden, particularly to the court system in its efforts to address the illegality of so many of the politicized actions taken, than in any administration prior so early in a 4-year term.

Most of us work as "at will" employees, even with that there should be protections to not be able to lose your employment because you don't beleve in Project 2025.  Or, the whim of a short-sited manager vs leader that wants to get to where they want to get faster.

If the current administration was not involved, I would support something like this - there is nothing worse than to see a good job occupied by a bad person. Bad meaning a selfish, non-caring person in a job to do as little as possible. Not bad as in "bad for me".

I am all for an adjustment to correcting waste and fraud.  Unfortunately, at this time I don't trust the decision makers.  We have three branches of government for a reason.

   Text sample: As a concerned US citizen, I strongly oppose this Proposed Rule. The Rule's stated aims are to ensure merit-based bipartisan job appointment, and to make it easy to dismiss civil service employees from their jobs. But these goals are in direct opposition to each other.

By removing Title 5 Chapters 43 and 75 procedural requirements, and eliminating the right of appeal, establishment of the Schedule F designation explicitly would allow firing for any cause, with no oversight or recourse. 

Regardless of hiring practices, thus would allow the culling and dismissal of employees for partisan reasons. Or for personal animus, or at the behest of moneyed interests, and so on. The text of the Proposed Rule warns of personal preferences overriding official duty, but Schedule F makes personal preference the only firing authority! No lengthy process, and no appeal, would exist to review and reverse potentially corrupt decisions.

Erosion of Merit-Based Protections

The cornerstone of the federal civil service is its commitment to merit-based hiring and retention, ensuring that employment decisions are grounded in qualifications and performance rather than political affiliation. By reclassifying positions into Schedule P/C, the proposed rule would strip affected employees of critical protections against arbitrary dismissal, effectively making them at-will employees.

   Text sample: Schedule F proposal is detrimental to American democracy.

The idea of reinstating Schedule F represents one of the most dangerous threats to the integrity of the United States federal government in modern times. At its core, Schedule F would politicize vast swaths of the career civil service, stripping essential job protections from thousands of federal employees whose primary qualifications are expertise, impartiality, and a commitment to public service, not political loyalty.

The American civil service system, built over a century, was designed explicitly to shield public administration from partisan manipulation. This reform traces directly back to the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, enacted in response to rampant political patronage and corruption during the so-called spoils system.The Pendleton Act replaced cronyism with a merit-based hiring system, protecting the government from becoming a revolving door of political loyalists and ensuring that professionals, not pa

This proposal states that a workplace culture that prizes ‚Äúfrank and fearless advice to agency leadership‚Äù is desired. I hope that is true, but without the guidance on how Schedule Policy/Career is to be implemented, I have too many questions. A person working under this schedule may need to be very careful.

Sometimes, that will be easy ‚Äì the supervisor calls a meeting and states that the purpose of the meeting is to provide input/advice.

   Text sample: It is not apparent that the OPM is addressing any real problem(s) but it is evident that it will create several serious problems that are avoided under the existing framework achieved after decades of steady improvement and judicicial rulings.  The existing framework recognizes "political appointees" who serve at the pleasure of the executive to insure that the Admin's agenda is followed.  Of course, it must be a lawful agenda and the President, the political appointees, and the bulk of the Civil Service all take an oath to support the Constitution.  I did.  In my experience during Federal service I never witnessed anyone other than the Exective demonstrate or act in a unconstitutional manner or in any way act to explicitly frustrate the Admin's stated policies.  Now to be truthful, the vast majority of civil servants,  much more than 90% probably do not have duties that rise to that level of impact.

   Text sample: Dear SIr/Madam,
Reinstating Schedule F would be a serious threat to American democracy. Our civil service was designed to be professional, nonpartisan, and focused on serving the public‚Äînot whoever holds political power at the moment. Turning thousands of expert career positions into political appointments opens the door to corruption, instability, and incompetence.

Every day, civil servants work behind the scenes to keep us safe. They're monitoring air and water quality, managing wildfire response, ensuring our food and medicines are safe, supporting veterans, and so much more. They aren‚Äôt in it for fame or fortune‚Äîthey‚Äôre in it because they believe in service.

Undermining their job security just because their expertise might be inconvenient to a political agenda is not only unfair‚Äîit‚Äôs dangerous. These professionals are the backbone of our government. Without them, we lose the consistent, fact-based leadership that protects our health, our environment, and our future.

   Text sample: As a former Social Studies teacher at the high school level, I am very concerned about President Trump's proposal to  remove 50,000 civil servants from the merit-based selection system.  There is a reason the Pendleton Act of 1883 was passed: a spoils system for  federal jobs meant that many unqualified and lazy supporters of the President were rewarded with jobs.  

Because current civil service employees cannot easily be terminated and replaced with a President's friends or relatives, many civil servants are employed for decades and have a wealth of knowledge about the program they administer.  This knowledge base can be lost if every President fires the previous President's appointees in order to bring in loyalists in their place.

The President already has many high level officials  (Cabinet members and others) that he or she can appoint in order to have government leaders who generally support the President's goals and policies.  If the President works with Congress to pass a new

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed regulation under Docket No. OPM-2025-0004-0001, which threatens the integrity of the federal civil service by weakening or removing long-standing protections against political interference. The core value of our civil service is its neutrality‚Äîserving the American people and executing the laws of the United States impartially, regardless of which political party is in power.

This proposal appears to pave the way for a modern-day spoils system by facilitating the reclassification or removal of federal employees based on political loyalty or ideology rather than merit, performance, or adherence to law. Such a system would erode public trust, disrupt continuity and expertise in federal agencies, and deter talented individuals from public service careers.

One of the most precious aspects of the large and stable bureaucracy our federal government has become is the consistency, reliability and INDEPENDENCE that is assured by a non-political civil service. The federal government is, for the most part, staffed with people valued for their WORK, their expertise, their competence, their skills - and very decidedly NOT their politics. Their loyalty is to the law, carefully considered and properly formulated regulations, and to the mission of their agency. This means that most of the agency work continues from administration to administration, congress to congress, while the political leadership work systematically to change the policies that guide their work.

Under the factually false guise of difficulty removing under-performing civil servants, you are yourselves intentionally politicizing the entire civil servant program. Far from correcting a problem that isn't there, you are indeed projecting what you yourselves are trying to do; politicize and weaponize the civil service, as well as every other department in the federal government. There are systems in place, just like every other business or organization, to take care of a worker who is not performing up to standards, and doing it has never been a problem in the civil service. There is no there, there. A federal government shifted to craven obeyance to one less-than-honorable individual is not a federal government of the people, by the people, and for the people. it is acquiescing to a dictator, or bending the knee to a king. You do not have a mandate to create a workforce of slack-eyed robots; whether you like it or not the reality is only 8/10 of 1%

‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù (now renamed Schedule Policy/Career) is shorthand for an executive order that is a sharp break with civil service merit principles, which assume that career employees should be retained on the basis of performance and protected against political coercion.

   Text sample: As a retired employee with 30+ years of experience in federal government, I strongly oppose this proposed rule.

The rationale for the rule is that many in federal service believe that it is too difficult to fire underperforming employees.  Further, there are multiple examples of employees, regardless of competence, opposing or resisting the implementation of policies determined by an Administration with no consequence.

As I understand it, the proposed solution to these problems is to create a new class of excepted service employees, mostly consisting of employees involuntarily classified from competitive positions.  These reclassified employees would not be provided any means of challenging their reclassification and could be fired at will from their new positions.  This problem is compounded by the considerable discretion that agencies are given in determining the particular positions that are subject to reclassification.

My concerns are regarding the proposed Schedule Policy/Career, which would effectively allow a huge number of important federal positions to be removed and replaced. 

I can see an argument for improved efficiency in the sense that being able to replace these positions at will would allow an administration to more smoothly act out policy plans. I will not engage with the argument that this is not necessarily a good thing; I will instead argue that focusing on this benefit alone is short-sighted. Let me paint a picture:

This legislation passes. The administration replaces thousands of positions over the course of the next year or so with loyalists who will facilitate broad policy plans of the administrations,

   Text sample: The proposal creates significant challenges to the core principles of a merit-based civil service. Reclassification of positions into Schedule Policy/Career without traditional civil service protections allows for politicization of roles that operate in a nonpartisan manner. This undermines the impartiality and expertise essential to effective governance.

The policy permits agencies to reclassify positions without notifying affected employees nor does it provide avenues for appeal. This absence of transparency and due process compromises employee rights and negatively impacts morale and trust. 

Eliminating procedural safeguards will lead to politicization of positions that influence policy. This results in decisions driven by political considerations rather than objective analysis and expertise. This will also lead to perpetual waste of taxpayer funds due to forced turnover occurring with each new administration and firing of at will workers owing to shifting priorities.

All this is is a naked attempt to weaken protections that government employees have when they already have a disadvantage in terms of pay, and one of the primary competitive reasons for the government and the public to reject this rule is because job protections is one of the few ways that the public sector has to retain talent, which is precisely why private sector interests and other malign interests want to gut it.

Congress has exclusive constitutional authority to structure the civil service and establish removal protections. See U.S. Const. art. I, 8; Myers v.

The Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. 1101, 2101 et seq., and related laws mandate merit-based hiring and for-cause removal, ensuring apolitical public service (Arnett v.

As an employee of the federal government, my comment is from a personal level.  I strongly object to introducing or reviving the "Schedule F" classification for federal workers. This plan jeopardizes the civil service system's foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit. Notably, President Trump has supported this merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which aimed to end the spoils system and ensure hiring and promotion based on merit.
I disagree with the conclusion that employees who faithfully perform their jobs to the best of their ability have little to fear from Schedule Policy/Career. The order expressly prohibits discrimination based on political affiliation, and agencies have strong incentives not to

I recently learned that the Office for Personnel Management (OPM has proposed a regulation
(‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù Federal
Register, 4/25/2025) that would effectively gut our Federal civil service system. As established
in The Pendelton Act (1883), our civil service system has been a merit-based system in which
government jobs are filled based on qualifications, skills, and performance. As Federal civil
servants, government employees follow and support the Constitution and in doing so, are to be
insulated from political pressure and can only be fired for cause (a failing in performing their
actual job) and not for any political reason. If the restructuring of our Federal civil service
system outlined in the OPM‚Äôs proposed regulation (as published 4/25/2025) were to be adopted
and put into practice, it will destroy civil service protections, create career

There is a pernicious idea in the administration that must be checked.  that is the notion that government service will be better by having more political appointees in supervisory positions.
That would be a return to the old patronage system, very inefficient and open to corruption, as we already see that Mr Young of Musks company has a severe conflict of interest, running the consumer financial protection bureau into the ground while also serving as  musk supervisor in businesses that are regulated by government mandate.

Do not use the so-called schedule F as Mr Trump proposes. Our civil servants deserve protection from arbitrary political whims about DEI and "wokeness".

   Text sample: I am a current federal employee who regularly works on policy issues. I write this in my personal capacity. I oppose this NPRM because, despite my apolitical views, I will be scared to give my true recommendations if I think they may be in conflict with an administration's position--Democrat or Republican--because they may assume I have political motives. Further, OPM should have given longer than 30 days for comment because it's clear people care about this rule and 30 days is too short a period. 

I oppose this rule because there is no evidence the rule will affect the changes it claims it will, because:

1. OPM incorrectly relies on wrongdoing, such as harassment, discrimination, financial malfeasance, etc. as justification for this rule. Yet OPM doesn't show how these behaviors are related to Schedule P/C jobs. As many OIG reports explain, the challenges are disciplining high performers who engage in these actions because the lack of desire to have high performers leave an office.

   Text sample: Reinstating Schedule F would undermine the foundation of a merit-based civil service and risk politicizing critical government functions. The original introduction of Schedule F sought to reclassify a broad swath of federal employees as ‚Äúexcepted service‚Äù positions, effectively stripping them of longstanding civil service protections. This would allow for mass dismissals of career public servants based on perceived loyalty rather than performance, integrity, or expertise.

Our federal workforce is designed to serve the American people, not the political whims of any one administration. These professionals such as (scientists, economists, attorneys, analysts, and many others) are selected through competitive processes and are expected to implement policy guided by law and evidence, not political loyalty. Schedule F blurs that line and invites dangerous instability into the civil service by exposing it to partisan purges.

Moreover, introducing such sweeping authority to remove employees

   Text sample: I know some people may be opposed to this, but I think it‚Äôs a good bill or a good proposal in that it allows management to release employees that are just doing the bare minimum to get by and working the system. I think this bill will help higher people that really are of high caliber with the mentality that they enjoy their jobs, are good at their jobs, and contribute to the field or series in which they are in. 

This way, those that are doing minimal work or minimal required work to keep their job will either be motivated to adjust their work ethic for the betterment of the federal government, or they are able to be released from the obligation of working for the federal government and go work in the public sector. 

I am a federal employee, but I am not in management, and I could see the benefit of this proposal going through.

I write these comments in my individual capacity, and would appreciate knowing how OPM would envision the following scenarios. I will use the OPM example of the EOS attorneys in the Civil Rights Division (although it's a silly example because I should hope those attorneys would not be considered Schedule P/C) as a basis for hypotheticals showing how unworkable the OPM NPRM is.

HYPOTHETICAL #1: I have conservative values and think that the case against Yale lacks merit, but because it aligns with my political beliefs, I do not mind filing an unfounded/meritless case.

   Text sample: As a citizen of this country who supports government efficiency, I am deeply opposed to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposed rule to allegedly increase career employee accountability by making these positions at-will.  The claim that the agency‚Äôs supervisors report great difficulty removing employees on the grounds of poor performance or misconduct sounds contrived and bogus.  Having worked in a public agency for many years I observed that these agencies had no problem removing an employee who was truly performing poorly or misbehaving.  There are plenty of methods available to document and prove that a dismissal is warranted.  These procedures that require documented proof act as a safeguard to prevent dismissals that are based on political or personal prejudice as opposed to actual deficient performance and/or misconduct.  Hence, this proposed plan to make such positions at-will seems to be a plot to undermine the dedication and expertise of employees who have elected to

Okay. So, what defines 'misconduct' in this context? What are the metrics for 'poor performance'? And lastly, how exactly does 'subverting Presidential directives' subvert democracy more so than the current President's own actions, words, and beliefs do? 

The President believes he is above punishment; the Constitution enshrines impeachment. The President rambles and blusters when questioned, constantly brags about how well he is doing, and consistently fails to deliver on his promises. Now, I know that politicians sweeping their campaign promises under the rug when elected is business as usual. It is the scale, scope, and global ramifications of said that worry me. 

So this proposed rule will allow employees to be fired for anything they do that subverts Presidential directives

   Text sample: The purpose of Civil Service, which replaced the "spoils system", is creating a meritocracy of career government employees who have time to learn their jobs (their fields of expertise) in depth over the course of decades -- if they show up for work and perform in their jobs, of course.

This expertise can then inform both decisions made by elected officials and the Senior Executive Service (political appointees), and regulatory actions such as rulemakings under various laws passed by Congress -- which are actually written by these experienced Civil Service employees.

Under Schedule F, an experienced, expert employee who uses facts to push back on a politically motivated initiative by a particular Administration, will simply be fired by that administration.  Their expertise will be permanently lost.  Capable people will be far less inclined to work for the lower salaries government offiers, if they are subject to such capricious firings.  And most importantly, the American people will

To Whom It May Concern:

Samuel I. Thorpe respectfully submits these comments in response to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed rule titled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù (90 Fed. Reg. 17182, April 23, 2025).

I write to express my opposition to the proposed rule.

As a professional economist whose work depends on the integrity, consistency, and credibility of federal data, I am deeply concerned that the rule would jeopardize the nonpartisan nature of the U.S. civil service and U.S. economic data. I and many other economic researchers rely on data produced by federal statistical agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, and others. These agencies have long maintained their credibility precisely because their work has been insulated from political inter

   Text sample: I'm very concerned about the proposed rule and think it would be a troubling change in policy. There are two main reasons that I think this proposed rule is a terrible idea: 

Although it portends to make employees more accountable to their assigned work objectives, in fact it would make them less accountable to their work and more accountable to the whims of the executive branch leader, the President.  There are reasons why federal employees are not currently "at will" employees - because it helps them be insulated from political calculations and allows them to be loyal to the assigned work. Why does this matter? It matters because the MOST important quality of an employee is their merit. Do they have the knowledge and skills to do the job well? This rule would instead make the most important characteristic of a federal employee their loyalty to the President. Federal employees do not work for the president, they work for the American people.

Institutionalizing politicized science
Donald Moynihan and Pamela Herd
The opening months of the Trump administration represent a historic disruption to
America‚Äôs scientific agencies. Staff have been fired or reassigned in the name of
efficiency, resulting in chaos. Grants have been canceled mid-project for featuring the
wrong words. ‚ÄúPauses‚Äù and ‚Äúreviews‚Äù are designed to block spending, in the hope that
Congress will make the current impoundment of funds a baseline for permanent
disinvestment. While the scientific community waits to see what the new normal will be,
the Trump administration has a plan to institutionalize a much more politicized structure
of control over government broadly, including both public scientific investments and the
use of scientific knowledge in policy actions.

You say you want to improve performance, accountability, and responsiveness, yet you're actually removing a system in place to ensure all that and replace it with a new way of doing things that let's political leaders, from both parties, to make massive changes however they like. Government jobs are paid for by taxpayers, and making their employment political moves their focus from serving the public to appeasing hyper-partisan leaders with very little, or no, knowledge of the critical processes of the federal government. 

Accountability, development, and responsiveness requires a rigorous, well documented, and publicly accessible system. The proposed rule has none of that, it removes what little of that already exists. If you want to improve things, focus on strengthening the new system, not just allowing political leaders to fire whoever they want whenever they want.

As a research scientist in molecular biology at Michigan State University, I have observed how NON political appointees working at our great federal agencies funding biomedical research have led the US to develop the world's top research enterprise, leading to countless breakthroughs directly impacting human health, agriculture, and technology. The program officers at NSF and NIH for example, play crucial roles in guiding funding decisions by these agencies, based on expert scientific input from scientists around the US. If they are replaced with political appointees, these positions will be fatally weakened, as such employees will be at the beck and call of short-term political operators, rather than serving scientific, fact-based processes.

Trump just loves to yell ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fired!‚Äù like the reality TV star he is and he wants to be able to retaliate against even more of our federal employees for retribution and political reasons, further impeding the effective functioning of our government and creating even more risk to our democracy.

Through inaction of Congress over the decades, the President has already accumulated way too much power, the assumption being that a good person would handle it responsibly. Trump is not a good person. He is a very self-centered, insecure bully who surrounds himself with incompetent loyalists like his Cabinet and is more concerned with personally benefiting and retribution, or golf, than running the country. He needs more guardrails,

A system of government appointments via loyalty to a president is dangerous.  This can be compared to the aftermath of the housing bubble (bursting in 2008).  The effects lasted for years.  It destroyed the wealth of millions of Americans through the loss of their homes.  The indirect effects are still with us.
The blame goes to all of the thousands whose expertise was influenced by the almighty worship of profit over the well-being of one‚Äôs fellow citizen.  Loyalty to the pursuit of profit no matter the cost was pervasive and absolute.  
Millions of bad loans were created by untold thousands of real estate appraisers, mortgage loan officers, the SEC and LLC‚Äôs formed for the purpose of bundling loans (good and bad).  
Now we have a pending disaster ‚Äì hiring and firing for the benefit of a current regime, rather than honesty and integrity owed to our fellow citizens.   I wish I could have faith in government employees to do the right thing.   B

I respectfully submit this comment in opposition to the proposed rule OPM-2025-0004, which would establish a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù (formerly Schedule F) category for federal employees in policy-influencing roles. This rule would undermine the foundations of a professional, merit-based, and nonpartisan civil service and introduce risks that far outweigh any stated benefits.

Erosion of Nonpartisan Public Service
The proposal would allow political appointees to reclassify tens of thousands of federal employees as at-will, stripping them of standard civil service protections. This change risks politicizing the federal workforce, removing long-standing safeguards that ensure federal professionals serve the public interest rather than the shifting political priorities of any single administration.

I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw its proposed rule to create a ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù classification and alter removal protections for federal employees. The proposal is unconstitutional, ultra vires, and incompatible with Congressional intent, established statute, and controlling precedent.

Separation of Powers and Congressional Prerogative Congress has exclusive constitutional authority to structure the civil service and establish removal protections. See U.S. Const. art.

   Text sample: Hello,

I am writing to share my opinion concerning the new rule known as "Schedule Policy/Career."

I would like to begin by examining the one of primary statements of this rule-

"At the same time, employees in such positions will serve at-will and will not be covered by chapter 43 or 75 procedures. This will enable the President and his appointed agency heads to hold Schedule Policy/Career employees meaningfully accountable for their performance and conduct."

The most basic definition of a civil servant is a person employed by an governmental agency to serve the government. Not one part of the government. Not the head of the government. The government, in all- executive, legislative, and judicial, local and national, everything. 

By making civil servants powerless pawns of the President and his "agency" (whatever that entails), they are rendered less able to perform their duties to both the US government and public. This rule presents an undemocratic, and more totalitarian process

The proposed OPM rule to shift "policy-influencing" positions into Schedule Policy/Career ("Schedule F") is a blatant backdoor attempt to install what will become effectively political appointees under the guise of appearing to be merit-based alone rather than based on political allegiance. The administration definition of "policy-influencing" is overly broad and can be applied to any position as presented here, subjecting a significant part or even the entirety of the federal workforce to treatment like the old spoils system in practice. This can easily be seen in the following example: The President orders an agency to undertake an obviously unlawful and illegal action. A now Schedule F federal employee rightly refuses to violate their oath and execute an illegal order. The President then fires this employee, advances another in their place, and repeats the illeg

Across different organizational settings, I was blessed by serious work, led by visionary leaders, and supported by extraordinarily skilled and dedicated career professionals without whom important missions would not have been accomplished. We took our orders from those appointed over us. We made many personal sacrifices for the greater good, and worked long hours, professionally and apolitically, to deliver desired outcomes.

the ‚Äúexcepted service‚Äù and fire-able at will. This rule change would allow a President to fire civil
servants without regard to their actual performance evaluations performed by their line
supervisor. This would allow the Executive branch to defy the will of the Legislative branch and
the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. This rule change could allow a president to decimate the
workforce capacity of entire Departments for political reasons without regard to whether their
missions are mandated by Congress or not.
Departments like the Environmental Protection Service (EPA) are especially vulnerable. Citizens
expect there to be clean air and water partly because of the EPA, and this rule change may be
used to disable Departments like the EPA (with regulatory powers) for

I disagree with the purpose of the proposed rule and see it as unnecessary. I grew up in
Chicago before the 1972 Shakman Decrees, which effectively barred Mayor Richard J.
Daley from patronage employment. Patronage is the system of hiring and firing civil
servants primarily based on political loyalties toward the elected hiring official. Prior to the
Shakman Decrees, the ‚Äúcity that works‚Äù was NOT the city that worked. Chicago was unable
to attract ‚ÄúA students‚Äù to the many jobs that fulfilled the promise of America‚Äôs third largest
city to its residents.
The proposed rule would take us backward to an inefficient and unp

   Text sample: To Whom It May Concern, Introduction: OPM-2025-0004 I am writing as a dedicated federal employee who has served our country for 34 years. My position has always been nonpartisan and does not involve the development or influence of public policy. Yet under the proposed schedule policy/career rule, my role is now being considered for reclassification into an excepted service category. I am deeply concerned about the fairness, transparency, and potential harm of this action, both to my family and to thousands of similarly affected public servants. 

Background: This comment is in response to the agency's proposal to implement the schedule policy/career rule, which aims to reclassify certain federal employees into a new employment category outside of traditional civil service protections, based on a vague standard of "policy influence." This rule appears to revive elements of the previously withdrawn Schedule F proposal. 

Analysis: The reclassification process outlined in this rule lacks

It's on record that in its short history, the Trump administration via DOGE has eroded federal agencies‚Äô effectiveness in administrating their missions.  Now, through EO 13957, Trump is attempting to additionally avoid safeguards that keep civil services free from political influence by issuing the newly-proposed OMB rule that would allow his administration to reclassify federal employees in ‚Äúpositions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character‚Äù as ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career Employees,‚Äù  allowing the administration to terminate their positions ‚Äúat will,‚Äù including for political reasons, with no appeal rights.

I specifically disagree with allowing "agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions  ... [who] undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives". First of all, "quickly" is not the right thing to promote in sensitive situations like this. It should be done thoughtfully and with due process.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose any effort to reinstate Schedule F, a proposed federal employment classification that threatens the integrity, impartiality, and effectiveness of the U.S. civil service.

Schedule F would allow broad reclassification of federal employees involved in "policy-determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating" roles, stripping them of their due process and merit-based civil service protections. This reclassification would open the door to mass politicization of the civil service, undermining a foundational principle of American democracy: that government professionals serve the public interest‚Äînot the political interest of any one administration.

Erosion of Merit-Based Employment
The core of the U.S. civil service system is its reliance on merit-based hiring and retention. By creating a new class of federal employees exempt from competitive hiring and procedural protections, Schedule F undermines this foundation. It risks turning experienced, apolitical experts into polit

I am writing in strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs proposed rule to create a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù category of federal employees that would strip longstanding civil servants of procedural protections and job security, effectively making them at-will employees. While I understand the need for accountability in public service, this proposal undermines the very foundation of a professional, apolitical civil service and dangerously revives the corrosive logic of the 19th-century spoils system.

The American merit-based civil service arose in response to widespread patronage and corruption, culminating in the Pendleton Act of 1883. Champions of reform like President Theodore Roosevelt recognized that a government of qualified professionals‚Äîinsulated from the partisan winds of each new administration‚Äîwas essential to effective governance, public trust, and democratic stability. This principle has stood for over a century: that while pol

   Text sample: I'm a concerned citizen with family members working for the U.S. government who is firmly against bringing back or introducing the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees. This plan seriously threatens the merit-based civil service system that‚Äôs kept our federal workforce professional and nonpartisan for over 100 years.

For starters, Schedule F goes against the whole idea behind the Pendleton Act of 1883. That law was meant to stop the old spoils system and make sure people were hired based on their skills‚Äînot politics. But Schedule F would let the government reclassify a lot of career civil servants, especially those involved in policy, and fire them without just cause. That opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing, which totally undermines the idea of an unbiased civil service‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs actually protected by law (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8)).

On top of that, the rules around who gets included in Schedule F are super vague and broad. That kind of uncertai

Government is a complicated thing. In order to run efficiently, there need to be people working at the various agencies who know what these agencies do and how to go about getting things done in order to serve the American people through their particular agency. 
There seems to be this idea that government workers are somehow scamming the American people by their mere presence and that anyone can do their jobs. This is patently false and it‚Äôs dangerous to think otherwise. The following example is about food inspection, but it could very well apply to airplane inspections, highway bridge inspections, or even seaport oversight.
The people who do these jobs are uniquely qualified to do them. They generally start their careers shortly after graduating from college and they begin work at the periphery and are working from or through someone who has way more experience than they do. They will be tasked with a problem that needs to be attended to and working with other

   Text sample: The proposed Schedule F stated goal is to keep employees from ‚Äúinjecting partisanship into the performance of their professional duties.‚Äù  

Current political appointees and Schedule C employees take considerable time to come up to speed to understand their jobs and the breadth and complexity of their departments so that they can make reasonable and informed decisions on leading their departments.  Adding an additional layer of political appointees will further exacerbate the time and effort to become effective.  Also, finding another 50,000 qualified employees will require a substantial recruiting and training effort at great expense.  

From my experience of working in senior positions at the Department of Energy Headquarters in Washington, I believe hiring 50,000 employees under the proposed Schedule F will have the opposite effect of the stated goal and lead to hiring unqualified political hacks who contribute little to advancing the goals of their department and are likely gone in

As Vice President of Conservation and Research at a major U.S. botanical garden, with a Ph.D. in biology and over a decade of experience leading scientific teams in genetics, conservation, and forest ecology, I have worked closely with numerous federal agencies across administrations.

   Text sample: This rule is a sharp break with civil service merit principles, which assume that career employees should be retained on the basis of performance and protected against political coercion. The US is already unusual in the degree to which it reserves the top layers of organizational leadership for short-term political appointees. This rule will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections, the basic constraint against political interference.

The administration says that the purpose of this rule is to increase accountability for civil servants involved in policy-making. Set aside the fact that civil servants are accountable in multiple ways, the administration's own justifications strike a more conspiratorial tone, including ‚Äúthe deep state can and must be brought to heel.‚Äù But what better way to actually institutionalize a deep state than by

In many cases, it is only through multiple decades of experiences that these civil servants are most effectively able to do their job. Likewise, the typically reduced pay for civil servants is offset by the promise of a federal pension and the stability and confidence that you can do work that may take generations to come to fruition. Many of our most ambitious programs have benefitted from steadfast and continuous leadership over the years.

OPA's proposed regulation does not explain how people who fall under Schedule P/C will be able to withstand political pressure if they are trying to keep their personal opinions aside and only give their best professional judgment, but that judgment happens to be contrary to administration preferences.

My writing expresses fierce opposition towards the Office of Personnel Management's OPM proposed rule to create the Schedule Policy/Career classification, which in practice means resurrecting the Schedule F that had been previously removed. This proposal severely damages the intended impact of the civil service merit system and breaches existing laws and constitutional fundamental rights.

1. Violation of Due Process Rights:

The proposed rule aims to carve out a specific set of federal employees who will not be afforded the protective layers of 5 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 4303 and 7513, which outlines a performance-based action and an employment adverse action. In stripping these protections, the rule violates the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment which states ‚ÄúNor shall any person be subjected to the shackles of liberty or life or property without a legal process.‚Äù The court of supreme judges has ruled that federal workers hold a vested interest in their employment, th

Why it matters: Public services‚Äîfrom infrastructure to public health‚Äîare complex and require skilled, experienced professionals.
Problem with political appointments: They often prioritize loyalty over qualifications.
Result: Less competent individuals may lead critical departments, reducing efficiency and effectiveness.
 2. Continuity and Stability
Why it matters: Many public programs are long-term (e.g., transportation systems, education policies).
Problem with political appointments: Frequent leadership turnover with each new administration can disrupt progress.
Result: Important work is constantly restarted or undone, wasting resources.
 3. Impartiality and Fairness
Why it matters: Public employees serve all citizens, not a political party or agenda.
Problem with political appointments: They can lead to bias or favoritism in service delivery or enforcement.
Result: Public trust

   Text sample: As a public school teacher and the family member of federal employees, I am writing to express my strong opposition to any attempt to revive or implement Schedule F‚Äîor any similar policy that seeks to strip job protections from career civil servants and politicize the federal workforce.

Non-partisan civil servants are the backbone of a functioning, effective government. They serve administrations of both political parties with integrity and professionalism, guided by facts, expertise, and a commitment to the public good‚Äînot partisan agendas. I rely on the work of these experts in my own profession. Sound, evidence-based education policy‚Äîon everything from student assessments to special education support‚Äîis shaped by professionals in the Department of Education and other agencies who understand the real needs of schools, teachers, and students. Politicizing these roles would risk turning education policy into a tool of ideology rather than a means to support learners and educators.

   Text sample: The proposed rule of converting policy-related positions to schedule F, states the following: "These positions will remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis. Yet they will be at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals. This will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives."
I strongly oppose this rule for various reasons, and for the rule contradicting itself by indicating it wants to have career jobs filled on a non-partisan basis, meaning the employee should be providing the best guidance and counsel based on knowledge, expertise and current laws, but then the rule indicates employee can be removed at will if such advice / guidance is not to the liking of the current administration. One of the main reasons why career employees have protections is because in the past some administrations (presidents)

Greetings from the Office of Formerly Functional Institutions (OFFI), where I‚Äôm currently the Deputy Assistant Acting Liaison to the Associate Undersecretary of Strategic Coffee Filter Compliance. It‚Äôs an unpaid position. Like all federal jobs now.

I write to you from the year 2037, where the Schedule Career/Policy rule passed years ago, triggering a cascade of firings that replaced every experienced, ethical, and competent civil servant with personal trainers, failed YouTubers, and the president‚Äôs cousin Rick.

We thought things might get rocky, but hey, how bad could it be? Turns out: very.

Let me paint you a picture of our thriving new government:

* The USDA is run by a former steakhouse host who thinks ‚Äúphotosynthesis‚Äù is a TikTok challenge.

* FEMA is now a lifestyle brand that sells custom candles shaped like flood zones.

* The EPA no longer tests water

1. First Amendment Rights
Federal employees have the right to free speech and political beliefs under the First Amendment. Firing someone for their views would violate those constitutional protections.

2. Merit-Based Civil Service
The federal government operates under a merit-based system, meaning employees are hired and retained based on skill and performance‚Äînot political loyalty. This system prevents political favoritism and ensures fairness.

3. Protects Against Corruption and Retaliation
Allowing political-based firings would lead to corruption, where jobs are given based on loyalty rather than competence. It would also discourage employees from speaking up or reporting wrongdoing.

4. Government Stability and Expertise
Federal employees provide continuity and expertise across administrations. Politicizing the workforce would damage long-term projects and make gover

Scientists generally work on complex projects that take significant time and resources to reach conclusions.

Under these high-pressure conditions, the best science will be done when workers have job security. Accountability DOES NOT mean punishment for finding unexpected or negative results; these are part of the extremely complicated nature of our work and it is not uncommon for a good idea on paper to end up being falsified by harsh reality.

Public Comment Opposing OPM‚Äôs Proposed Rule on Schedule
Policy/Career
I. Introduction
This comment is submitted in opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM)
proposed rule titled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the
Civil Service‚Äù (Docket OPM-2025-0004). The rule would create a new Schedule
Policy/Career excepted service category that removes procedural and appeal protections
under Title 5, chapters 43 and 75, from career federal employees in positions deemed to be
'policy-influencing.' This comment argues that the proposed rule is inconsistent with the
core principles of the merit-based civil service, lacks a sound statutory basis, is unsupported
by empirical evidence, and poses serious risks to democratic governance, agency
effectiveness, and the constitutional balance of power.

Supplemental Comment on OPM Proposed Rule: Schedule Policy/Career
Should Be Limited to SES Positions Only
Submitted to: Office of Personnel Management
Docket No. OPM‚Äì2025‚Äì0004
This supplemental comment addresses a core structural flaw in the proposed rule: the
failure to limit ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù classification exclusively to members of the Senior
Executive Service (SES). The broad and vague definitions of ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù positions
open the door to reclassifying career civil servants at the GS-13, GS-14, GS-15‚Äîand

   Text sample: Legal Argument Against OPM‚Äôs Schedule F NPRM (April 2025)

The Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) April 23, 2025, NPRM establishing ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù (Schedule F) violates federal law, exceeds executive authority, and undermines the merit-based civil service. By reclassifying career civil servants as at-will employees without protections under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 4303 and 7513, the rule contravenes the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) and judicial precedent. Reclassifying employees not hired into Schedule F further violates due process and accrued rights.

Argument 1: Schedule F Violates Statutory Intent and Precedent
Schedule F misinterprets the CSRA‚Äôs excepted service exemptions, limited to ‚Äúconfidential, policy-determining‚Äù roles (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2103). United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988), underscores Congress‚Äôs intent to protect career employees from arbitrary dismissal. Lovshin v. Department of Navy, 767 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985), requires narrow exemptions, yet Schedule F‚Äôs

   Text sample: Schedule Policy/Career: An Assault on Expertise, Integrity, and Democratic Governance
Overview
The implementation of Schedule Policy/Career, or Schedule F, by the current administration represents a dangerous and regressive step in federal workforce policy. It enables the removal of career civil servants without due process, particularly those involved in policy formulation. This is not simply a restructuring‚Äîit is a calculated effort to purge expertise, suppress dissent, and consolidate power by targeting those who best understand the workings of government.

Firing the Capable and Informed
At the heart of this policy is a deeply troubling trend: the removal of smart, capable, and experienced professionals. These individuals are not political appointees; they are career public servants whose loyalty lies with the law, the Constitution, and the American public. They possess the institutional knowledge needed to develop sound policies, advise leadership, and maintain operational continu

As an American citizen who values effective governance, I believe this proposed rule undermines the foundational principles of our nonpartisan, merit-based civil service system that has served our country effectively for more than a century. The proposed changes would harm government operations in several critical ways:

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to classify policy-influencing positions into Schedule Policy/Career, making them at-will and removing adverse action and appeal protections. This move threatens the integrity of the federal civil service.

1. Risk of Encouraging Propaganda:
   Allowing quick dismissal without due process pressures employees to align with political narratives instead of presenting objective truth. This could lead to a system where truth is suppressed in favor of politically convenient messaging, ultimately institutionalizing propaganda within the government.

2. Chilling Effect on Free Expression:
   Eliminating appeal rights erodes protections meant to shield civil servants from political retaliation. Employees may self-censor, avoiding honest, dissenting, or critical views for fear of termination, undermining open discussion and

While I support efforts to enhance accountability in the federal workforce, I have significant concerns about the rule‚Äôs lack of clarity and its potential unintended consequences.

1. Lack of Clear Definition for "Policy Influencing Positions"

The most fundamental issue with this rule is its failure to clearly define what constitutes a "Policy Influencing Position."

   Text sample: I am strongly opposed to the proposed rule ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù (90 FR 17182). As the summary states, the rule would recategorize a wide range of long-standing career positions from the competitive service into a new excepted service schedule for ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù roles. This change would remove long-established due process protections for thousands of civil servants by stripping their rights to adverse action procedures and appeals.

First, I want to acknowledge that I will be personally affected by this rule.

I appreciate the expertise and competence that they are able to develop through this continuity of service.   I want the best people in federal jobs,  not a revolving cast of political hacks.

1. **Undermining the Independence of Civil Service**

The federal civil service system, as designed by the founders and codified over the years, is founded on the principle of an independent, non-partisan, and professional workforce that serves the nation‚Äînot the whims of any political administration. While the rule proposed by the OPM purports to enhance accountability in cases of misconduct or poor performance, the mechanism it proposes would dramatically undermine the longstanding tradition of civil service independence.

By allowing agency supervisors to easily dismiss career employees in policy-influencing positions for reasons not constrained by established civil service protections (such as adverse action procedures or appeals), the proposed rule introduces a level of political interference into the daily operations of government agencies. The federal workforce would become susceptible to the shifting tides of politic

I urge OPM to withdraw the proposed rule or, at minimum tighten the definition of ‚Äúpolicy-making,‚Äù to only include positions that impact final policy decisions versus those that ‚Äúuphold‚Äù enacted policy and ‚Äúevaluate‚Äù associated processes (which are not interchangeable with ‚Äúpolicy-making‚Äù roles).

The Administrative Procedures Act (APA) requires that agencies provide a reasoned basis for regulatory change, particularly where prior rules established statutory reliance interest. Existing civil service protection apply to employees involuntarily moved to new schedules, and the exceptions codified in 5 U.S.C. 7511 (b)(2) apply only to non-career political appointees.

   Text sample: Comment on Proposed Rule: ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù (RIN 3206-AO26)

I strongly oppose the proposed rule to reestablish a Schedule F classification within the federal civil service. While it is framed as a way to improve accountability and responsiveness, it poses serious legal, constitutional, and policy concerns that threaten the integrity of the merit-based, nonpartisan federal workforce.

Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978

The Civil Service Reform Act was enacted to ensure that hiring and firing decisions are made based on merit, not political affiliation. This rule would allow broad reclassification and termination of employees without due process protections guaranteed under Title 5. Such actions undermine the very principles Congress intended to preserve and may exceed the executive branch‚Äôs legal authority.

To bring back Schedule F would be to invite partisanship into the heart of our federal workforce. It would strip away long-standing civil service protections from countless public servants, refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals who have devoted their lives to protecting our shared natural heritage. These individuals serve not for politics, but for purpose. Their work is rooted in science, guided by law, and driven by a quiet, steadfast commitment to the public good.

The National Wildlife Refuge System is already in a fragile state. Since the beginning of 2025 alone, we‚Äôve lost over 20% of the remaining staff, this on top of a 30% decline over the last decade and a half. Many refuges now stand silent, with nearly one in ten lacking even a single staff member. Not a single refuge has what it needs to thriv

   Text sample: At will employment for federal employees too easily risks shaping the government into biased, unquestioning servitude to partisan politics. It would massively destabilize the effectiveness of the entire federal government as populations of federal employees are systematically replaced in favor of sycophants who would resist the will of executive office should control of the presidency change hands from one party to another. Additionally, federal employees have been facing increased undue criticism, declining benefits, and lower pay than their private sector counterparts. Removing the protections on federal employees will leave no true benefits of working for the federal government aside from a patriotic dedication to one's country. Continuing to degrade the standard of living of the populace reduces ones patriotism to the country, removing even that benefit from recruitment and making recruitment near impossible without further making life worse in the private sector to compete.

   Comment IDs: OPM-2025-0004-13503
   Text sample: I strongly oppose this rule for the following reasons:

1. Undermines the Merit System and Nonpartisanship
   The creation of a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù category effectively revives the discredited Schedule F scheme by reclassifying career policy positions as at‚Äëwill. This shift removes procedural protections under 5 U.S.C. Chapters 43 and 75, inviting political influence into roles that must remain nonpartisan to ensure objective policy implementation.

2. Circumvents Statutory Safeguards
   Congress has consistently protected career civil servants from arbitrary removal to preserve expertise and institutional memory. The Administrative Procedure Act and Civil Service Reform Act establish clear appeals processes; this rule seeks to bypass those safeguards without congressional authorization, risking legal challenges and executive overreach.

   Text sample: It's deeply concerning to consider the implications of a federal rule that would dismantle the professional civil service and replace it with a patronage system, reminiscent of the Schedule F proposal. Such a move would fundamentally undermine the principles of merit-based hiring and retention that have long been the bedrock of an effective and impartial government. Converting professional civil servants into political appointees who can be fired "at will" opens the door to potential politicization of crucial government functions, eroding the expertise and continuity that career professionals bring.

Here in California, we understand firsthand the vital importance of a robust and high-quality state civil service.

   Text sample: I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw its proposed ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù rule. The proposal conflicts with established statutory protections, violates due process, and undermines the merit-based civil service system enshrined in the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978.

1. Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978

The CSRA (5 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 4301-4305, 7511-7514) ensures that federal employees may only be removed or disciplined for cause, with procedural protections including the right to appeal adverse actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The proposed rule creates a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù category that exempts employees from Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5. This directly contradicts the statutory framework of the CSRA.

And if they do not follow the President, then they will be fired.

If the goal is to address poor performance and conduct issues, the current personnel structure is not the problem.  And shifting more career federal employees into political positions is certainly not the solution.

   Text sample: I am submitting this comment in response to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs proposed rule entitled Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service, published on April 23, 2025.

While I whole-heartedly support efforts to enhance responsiveness and performance accountability across the federal workforce, I urge OPM to consider that the root cause of federal performance and misconduct management challenges lies far upstream from termination authorities. The inability of agencies to remove employees who are underperforming or engaging in misconduct is not primarily due to legal constraints ‚Äî it is due to the systemic underdevelopment, under-vetting, and under-assessment of federal supervisors.

Specifically:

Supervisors are most often placed in supervisory roles without being vetted for their ability to exercise their legal supervisory authorities under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 7103(a)(10), which include the responsibilities to hire, assign, direct, discipline, eval

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) proposed rule "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service."

While the administration claims this would streamline the removal of underperforming or noncompliant employees, the broad scope of the proposal creates opportunities for misuse and threatens due process protections that are vital to a fair and professional civil service. Roles within my organization that had no policy influence whatsoever, including budget, science, administrative, and communication managers, were to be reclassified.

I was proud to be American as we learned about the systems our government put in place to prevent such corruption in the future.  We should not lose that victory!

The US government needs to work effectively and efficiently and therefore needs to be able to manage workers with poor performance.  Like businesses, there need to be clear and consistent rules on what constitutes poor performance and they must be non-political. 

The job of most employees in the administrative agencies is to understand and carry out the laws enacted by Congress.  They are recruited to do so, trained and have expertise in their agency‚Äôs specialty.  They are not political appointees precisely because they remain in place interpreting and enforcing the same laws across administrations.

I am a retired professional engineer that worked as a senior manager at a large aerospace corporation.  I had years of experience managing employees, and it was the most important part of my job.  I see several problems with the SUMMARY: paragraph of this proposed policy as described in the next four paragraphs.  
First, it should be difficult to remove employees from their job.  My corporation required that the employee be informed of shortfalls in performance or behavior, and given a chance to improve.  This process involved performance-improvement-plans and appraisals and took about 6 months to complete.  The whole process was monitored by a Human Resources specialists.  In most cases we completed the process to everyone's advantage without replacing the employee.
Second, there are obvious contradictions in the SUMMARY: paragraph.  The positions are described as being "career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis" yet th

   Text sample: I am writing to express significant concerns regarding the proposed rule OPM-2025-0004-0001, titled "Reforming the Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Service." While the intent to streamline hiring processes and restore merit-based principles is commendable, the implementation of this rule may inadvertently introduce substantial risks to national security, employee morale, and the overall effectiveness of the federal workforce.

Risk of Insider Threats and Foreign Interference

The proposed rule's emphasis on rapid hiring and the reduction of background investigation timelines could compromise the thoroughness of security vetting processes. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has been working to streamline personnel vetting policies, aligning standards for background investigations and suitability determinations.   However, accelerating these processes without adequate safeguards may lead to insufficiently vetted individuals entering sensitive positions.  Thi

   Text sample: I have worked at FDA for almost a decade, and I have been a supervisor at the agency for nearly five years. The proposed rule states that supervisors in the federal government report "great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct." This is not the case within FDA. We have terminated employees in my operating unit for poor performance, and my colleagues in other operating units have terminated employees for misconduct. Federal employees have civil service rights; therefore, proper documentation of poor performance or misconduct is necessary, as is following formal procedures when removing an employee. Nevertheless, removing employees for poor performance or misconduct happens, and it happens without "great difficulty" as the proposed rule suggests. 
 
The proposed rule cites surveys that indicate some federal employees perceive that poor performers are dealt with inadequately and some supervisors believe the process for removing poor performers is "discouraging.

Comment on Proposed Rule: Improving Performance, Accountability
and Responsiveness in the Civil Service (May 18, 2025)
This comment addresses the proposed rule to reestablish an excepted service schedule for
positions of a policy-determining, policy-making, policy-advocating, or confidential
character‚Äîpreviously known as Schedule F, now known as Schedule Policy/Career.
This comment is being submitted anonymously due to my current position in the federal
civil service and concern about retaliation.
1. Exclude Bargaining Unit Employees from Coverage
Employees who are part of a recognized bargaining unit should be categorically and
expressly excluded from classification under Schedule Policy/Career. This exclusion is
compelled by the structure of Chapter 71 of Title 5, which restricts bargaining units to non-
policy roles.
Under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 7112, Congress provided that a bargaining unit is app

   Text sample: I write to express strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs April 23, 2025 proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.‚Äù While framed as a good-faith effort to address performance and misconduct in federal agencies, the proposal in fact reintroduces the core components of the discredited ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù initiative and risks politicizing the nonpartisan civil service under the guise of accountability.

This rule would permit agencies to reclassify career roles as Schedule Policy/Career positions and strip employees in those roles of the due process protections established under Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5. These safeguards‚Äîincluding notice, explanation, and the right to appeal adverse actions‚Äîare not bureaucratic obstacles; they are essential protections that preserve the integrity, professionalism, and nonpartisanship of the federal workforce.

   Text sample: This proposed addition of another civil service Schedule threatens the separation of powers and undermines the will of the people.  If a single party is able to fraudulently campaign on a false platform that appeals enough of the electorate so that the party's candidates for Congress and the Executive prevail ("candidate" is an ironically cynical term in this scenario...), once the officers are sworn in, that party can replace the entire policy-making workforce in the Executive branch. At that point, the party can begin the unlawful and counter-majoritarian agenda they concealed during the election.

In doing so, the remaining checks on the concentration of power into a single, minority faction will be overmatched by the sheer velocity and enormous volume of changes that are made.  All of the prohibitions on the government's power, enumerated in the Bill of Rights can be neutered for long enough--perhaps forever--as the Chief Executive concentrates and consolidates a growing reservoir

   Text sample: The resurrection of Schedule F is not a bureaucratic tweak ‚Äî it is an attempted dismantling of the very architecture that separates a free democracy from authoritarian rule. Under the false banner of ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù and ‚Äúaccountability,‚Äù Schedule F threatens to turn the federal civil service into a partisan patronage system, where allegiance to the president outweighs allegiance to the Constitution.

Let us be unequivocal: this is not reform. It is a hostile takeover of the federal workforce.

Schedule F would allow the president to fire tens of thousands of career civil servants and replace them with political loyalists. These are not faceless bureaucrats. They are the public health scientists at the CDC, the inspectors general who root out corruption, the financial regulators who prevent another crisis, and the intelligence analysts who keep this nation safe. Under Schedule F, their jobs would depend not on merit or law, but on loyalty to a single individual. That is not public service

It's one of the least American rules I can imagine, and it's appalling that it's even under consideration.  It's a blatant attempt to stack the ranks of federal employees with loy

The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 established that hiring people to work in the United States federal government would be based on merit, thus replacing a corrupt patronage system.  In other words, the Pendleton Act specified that federal employees should be hired on the basis of what they know rather than who they know.  Advancement and promotions were to be based on actual achievement and meeting performance goals, not based on campaign contributions, votes delivered, or political considerations.

guiding light for all who serve in our government (and frankly, for all who make their home
here): adherence to the Constitution of the United States and the laws that conform to it. Every
Federal employee takes an oath to the Constitution--not to a political party or ideology or to an
individual.
Second, Federal agencies exist to serve We the People by carrying out the responsibilities that
they have been assigned by Congress and for which Congress has provided the funding. Our
Federal work force is comprised of dedicated, hard-working individuals committed to applying
themselves without reservation to serving the people of this country and the ideals upon which
it was founded. This regulatory change will jeopardize the data, law, just

   Text sample: As a dedicated federal employee serving in the United States Space Force, I am compelled to express my strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed rule to establish the ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù (Schedule P/C) classification. This proposal, which effectively revives the previously rescinded Schedule F, poses a significant threat to the foundational principles of a merit-based, apolitical civil service.

Erosion of Civil Service Protections

The proposed rule seeks to reclassify approximately 50,000 federal positions into Schedule P/C, rendering these roles ‚Äúat-will‚Äù and stripping employees of critical protections under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75. This includes the loss of due process rights and appeal mechanisms traditionally afforded to career civil servants . Such a shift undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was enacted to ensure that federal employment decisions are based on merit and free from political influence.

Members of the Intelligence Community are generally already in the "excepted service," as outlined in documents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/536); Department of Defense (https://dcips.defense.gov/Portals/50/Documents/Fact%20Sheets/DCIPSFactSheetExceptedService201102.pdf?ver=2017-02-16-140311-663), and the Central Intelligence Agency (https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/cia-rdp92-00455r000100160066-6).

   Text sample: I submit these comments in strong opposition to the proposed rule to create a new Schedule Policy/Career category. This rule weakens existing due process protections and enables the reclassification of competitive service positions into the excepted service. These changes collectively undermine the merit-based, nonpartisan civil service and risk politicizing the federal workforce.
Schedule F allows the reclassification of federal employees into positions deemed "policy-influencing," making them subject to dismissal without the usual civil service protections. This could lead to the politicization of the federal workforce, where hiring and firing decisions are based on political loyalty rather than merit or performance. This shift undermines the nonpartisan nature of federal agencies and could erode public trust in government institutions.  
Schedule F could result in federal jobs being awarded based on political affiliation rather than qualifications. Reintroducing such practices could

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rule ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.‚Äù I appreciate the attempt to modernize the federal civil service, however I believe that if this rule were to be enacted that performance, accountability, and responsiveness would decline. If enacted, this rule would impact all agencies. My comment focuses specifically on the impact on health agencies. 

Agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services provide crucial services to the American public. They conduct transformative research, and their innovation puts them at the forefront of progress. One of the reasons why HHS is able to do this is because of the career civil servants, who are dedicated to science and to the American public. What would be the impact to future scientific and public health progress if this rule is implemented? For example, there is increasing emphasis on microplastics in our food an

Making high-level decision-makers in scientific agencies subject to political winds will dramatically reduce our ability to solve scientific problems and will cede global scientific leadership to our rivals.

Federal employees tell me about the deep commitment to non-partisanship in their workplaces. They emphasize that they never, never, express their personal political views at work.

While I understand that it is important career civil service employees be accountable in their positions, there needs to be protections in place to perform their jobs without partisan reprisal. In the current administration it appears as if any employee who disagrees will face consequences. To be an effective, employees making policy, one must be able to point out ideas that may be contrary to a law or statute that currently exists. In addition, the data used to support the idea that poor performers don't have any consequences was based on anonymous employee surveys and employees have no way of actually accessing coworkers performance reviews to determine if this is true. Another reason employee surveys are not reliable source for data is that not everyone takes them seriously.

   Text sample: I am submitting comments on this proposed regulation based on my personal experience as a federal employee.  Although I am now retired after 40 years of service, I served as the Congressional Liaison Officer in the U.S. EPA, Region 5, office for 23 years of my federal employment, under the administrations of President Reagan (R), President George H.W. Bush (R), President Bill Clinton (D), President George W. Bush (R) and President Barak Obama (D).  During that time, I worked in the office of the Regional Administrator, reporting to the only political appointee in the Region.  My personal political views were never a factor in how I worked with the RA or interacted with the Congressional offices of either party.  When I retired, I received thank you letters from many Senators and Congressmen of both parties.  Federal employees should be able to put aside their personal political views and work with whichever party is in power.  If they can‚Äôt, I feel it‚Äôs time to look for another job.  U

   Text sample: I oppose any effort to implement or resurrect the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification due to the serious operational and national security risks it introduces. Beyond undermining the longstanding merit-based civil service system, Schedule F would inject instability and unpredictability into federal agencies that rely on continuity, institutional memory, and nonpartisan expertise to function effectively.

Government agencies, especially those involved in critical areas like national defense, public health, and economic stability, depend on experienced career professionals who can provide consistent, fact-based guidance across administrations. Schedule F would enable mass removals of these experts at the discretion of political appointees, severely weakening the government‚Äôs capacity to respond to crises, manage complex programs, and deliver services to the American public without disruption.

By making thousands of civil servants vulnerable to politically motivated dismissal, Schedule F would

   Text sample: This rule makes reference to employees supposedly subverting the will of the American people by putting their own political preferences first and refusing to faithfully implement the President's policy goals. However, an important part of policy development is raising potential legal or operational obstacles to proposed changes. If employees are afraid that this important function may be conflated with obstructing or sabotaging the President's agenda they will be less likely to speak out, leading to more problems down the road and potentially doing more to derail the policy when it faces legal challenges after implementation.

Administrations and their political appointees at each agency are always free to weigh the advice given by career civil servants and ignore that which they disagree with, but it is important that they are presented with all possible contingencies so they can make informed decisions. This rule would muzzle the most experienced civil servants and turn them into lit

Docket ID: OPM‚Äì2025‚Äì0004
90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025)

To Whom It May Concern:

I write to express strong opposition to the proposed rule titled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.‚Äù While framed as a reform to enhance government performance, this rule is, in fact, a deeply concerning attempt to erode the bedrock of America‚Äôs apolitical, expert-driven civil service.

As a professional working in public policy and strategy with extensive experience engaging with federal agencies on complex environmental and governance issues, I have seen firsthand the importance of a career civil service protected from political interference. This rule, by reviving and repackaging the prior ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù initiative under the new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career,‚Äù would fundamentally

   Text sample: Employment rules governing the civil service are set out in the Civil Service Reform Act, which has been in place for 50 years, and has, as is written in its introductory text, the goal of providing the "people of the United States with a competent, honest, and productive Federal work force reflective 
of the Nation's diversity." It achieves this goal, as everyone knows, by providing specific protections to members of the civil service, which, besides a miniscule number of high-level, highly influential presidential appointees, is comprised of Americans of all social classes who are dedicated to carrying out often complex tasks in service of the country with little reward, favor, or recognition.

The protections involve simply a requirement for documentation on why an employee has been separated from service, and the chance for a worker to defend their actions for being separated. Anyone who believes that hard work is the foundation of a healthy nation and a happy life, wishes for the

   Text sample: The title of this proposed regulation is ironic, in that it would achieve the opposite effect, if passed.

Federal civilian employees are already held to extremely high ethical standards. The Hatch Act prohibits them even from "liking" political social media posts, on their own personal devices, on their lunch break.

Supervisors and agency leadership are emphatic in communicating these rules, with widespread compliance from the federal workforce. 

This political neutrality does not occur in spite of federal employees' convictions, but because of them. Civil servants perform their duties for the good of the American people, regardless of their political leanings. Serving the American people is an apolitical pursuit.

The positions proposed for reclassification are not a threat, but rather a boon to this apolitical pursuit. In fact, policy analysts are usually the staff members communicating Hatch Act provisions across the agency. Grants-focused staff ensure that recipients of federal

To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management's proposed rule,
"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" (Docket ID: OPM-2025-
0004-0001). This proposal, which seeks to codify the "Schedule Policy/Career" (formerly Schedule F)
classification, poses a significant threat to the integrity of the federal civil service and the protections afforded
to career federal employees.
Erosion of Due Process Protections
The proposed rule would allow for the reclassification of numerous policy-influencing positions into the
Schedule Policy/Career category, effectively stripping affected employees of critical due process rights. Under
this classification, employees could be terminated without notice, cause or the ability to appeal, undermining the
merit-based principles that have long been the foundation of the federal workforce.

Submitted by: Former Federal Employee

To Whom It May Concern:

I respectfully submit this comment in strong opposition to the establishment of the ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù classification under Executive Order 14171. While framed as a tool for accountability, this authority undermines civil service protections, politicizes public administration, and destabilizes constitutional governance.

Though renamed, Schedule Policy/Career mirrors the intent of the rescinded Schedule F and presents even greater risks by suggesting permanence for an inherently anti-merit structure.

I. Civil Servants Owe Loyalty to the Constitution, Not to Political Leadership

Federal employees take an oath under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 3331 to ‚Äúsupport and defend the Constitution.‚Äù Their allegiance is to law‚Äînot to a President, party, or ideology. Reclassifying career roles into at-will appointments opens the door to loyalty tests and political dism

A "spoils system" or a patronage system is corrosive to the human spirit leading to elevation of incompetence and corruption. It is a system based on fealty not fairness and would reduce efficiency in government.  

A system where only loyalty is rewarded and where all employees serve 'at will' is much worse for employees and the country. This is not my opinion but the basis for the Pendleton Act, which remains the law of the land.

   Text sample: The OPM proposed rule to increase government employee accountability increases polarization and undermines moderation in government by empowering presidents to replace government employees with people who are loyal to them. In the worst case scenario, the president could require a demonstration of fealty. This proposed rule puts employees at risk of retribution based on opinion rather than performance. Furthermore, appointing government employees administration by administration is unrelated to the goals for efficiency the current administration touts. There is a risk of losing  historic knowledge of processes, running up high costs for training, and slowed productivity. 
I request the consideration of alternate approaches to improve the ability to  remove government employees from their posts.  Data driven annual reviews with a stipulation on hire that performing below specified thresholds for specific data points would result in retraining  and  lowered annual raise and if this is re

I am writing today as a concerned citizen and a University Research Administrator, who has spent my career administering federal research grants to enable the groundbreaking scientific discoveries made possible by the rich history of the U.S. government - University research partnership.
I am particularly concerned with the portion of the rule which recommends additional guidance for categorization into Schedule Policy/Career positions:
"Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients."

To Whom It May Concern,
As a former federal employee submitting this comment in my personal capacity, I strongly oppose the proposed

Over the course of my federal career, I witnessed and personally experienced a system where many employees,
particularly those who spoke up, filed complaints, or simply worked with integrity‚Äîwere punished or targeted

because of favoritism and bias. In several instances, management coordinated to push out employees they didn‚Äôt

   Text sample: I strongly disagree with the assertion in the proposed rule that "Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions." This statement stands in stark contrast to how the NIH functions, how grants are reviewed, and how grants are awarded. NIH staff with longstanding expertise are incredibly valuable with advanced knowledge of where the leading edge of research is, and where independent scientific investigators see the greatest potential impact to be made- but they themselves do not directly recommend grants for funding. Rather, funding recommendations are primarily based purely on merit of the independent review performed by study sections.

These include positions that require the production of objective, unbiased and factual information and the evaluation of policy options using high quality and nonpartisan methods and analyses according to professional standards. The holders of these jobs typically hold professional degrees such as Ph.D. or M.D. in relevant fields for the given job category.

Dear Office of Personnel Management:

I, Jessica Rutter, submit this comment regarding OPM's Proposed Rule ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule.

I have previously served in the federal government as a political SES managing career SES and GS-15 employees, including attorneys.

   Text sample: I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw its proposed rule to create a ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù classification and alter removal protections for federal employees. The proposal is unconstitutional, ultra vires, and incompatible with Congressional intent, established statute, and controlling precedent.

Separation of Powers and Congressional Prerogative Congress has exclusive constitutional authority to structure the civil service and establish removal protections. See U.S. Const. art. I, ¬ß8; Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 123 (1926); Humphrey‚Äôs Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 627‚Äì29 (1935); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 685‚Äì86 (1988). The Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1101, 2101 et seq., and related laws mandate merit-based hiring and for-cause removal, ensuring apolitical public service (Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 151‚Äì52 (1974)). The proposed rule attempts to nullify these statutory safeguards by regulation, usurping Congress‚Äôs legislative prerogative (INS v

   Text sample: Docket (OPM-2025-0004)
The proposed "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" is ill-conceived. In my 30-year experience working for the Federal Government, I witnessed that employees who did not perform according to the evaluation criteria were given feedback on how to improve their performance, including taking additional training, coaching, and frequent feedback from their supervisors. If the support provided did not result in improved performance, the employee was terminated. In some cases, an employee was terminated for blatant poor performance, or misconduct, after receiving reasons for the termination. Therefore, it is unlikely that Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct. 

However, what is happening now across Federal Agencies is NOT providing steps for Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service. Instead, skilled, expert, scientific employees can be

It is laughable to think that the American People will accept a system that hires people to do the work of the People to secure a healthy, safe environment that have no background or knowledge in the specific work they are hired to do.

Based on my long years of experience with federal employees, this increase would have the opposite effect of what is intended.  Drastically increasing the political workforce decreases the expertise of most positions, leads to decision-making based on immediate political needs rather than long-term public needs, and generally sends the message that the federal work force is there to do the executive body's bidding rather than serve the American public.

   Text sample: I oppose the changes to the civil service system that are included in the proposed rule.  I think these changes are overreaching and would politicize many positions in the government.  Many career government employees, such as myself, are called on to advise on policy matters and do so based on their expertise and knowledge.  By converting these employees to at will employees, I worry that the government will lose workers who are knowledgeable about the area they work in, and that with every change of an administration new people would be brought in who would accede to the preferences of the President and his administration, without having historical knowledge or expertise or experience that would be relevant to forming policy.  For example, many years ago I worked at the National Institute of Mental Health in an office that supported research on a variety of topics from domestic violence and mental health to links between serious mental illness and criminal behavior.

I expect these civil services to be based in law and governed by the constitution.

I believe this rule allows any given Administration to replace the nation's professional cadre of policy experts who serve the Constitution across Administrations with individuals who subordinate their duty to the Constitution and the law to partisan loyalties.

   Text sample: These proposed changes do not address their stated concern about removing poor performers because the changes have no requirement to evaluate employees, but rather seek to circumvent evaluation. 

Removing the employees' ability to challenge the firing and claim that the action is mistaken requires the process that currently exists, in which the employee can provide evidence that they are not a poor performer but are being fired for personal or political reasons that are antithetical to the well-being of the Nation and performance of their task in service to the country.

Removing poor performers requires examining evidence of performance evaluation. That must include evidence the employee provides. Employees have access to details and context that their supervisor does not, and certainly which a political appointee at the head of the agency would not. Full evaluation requires an opportunity for the employee to challenge the evaluation and firing.

To any student of the history of the United States and its government, especially from more than a century ago, this is a terrible idea that belongs on the ash heap of that history. 

This has nothing to do with improving the accountability and performance of the government and everything with creating a workforce that cannot make decisions without being concerned about the response from the Executive branch, even though many don't even fall under its purview. 

Increasing the number of political appointees would create a new venue where such polarization would undermine the quality of governance by replacing moderates with extremists - on both sides. Career officials tend to be more moderate, and can help with the swings of political change. This implies that the sort of rapid change of political appointees with a new administration would, as it did during the 19th century spoils system, engender instability.

The proposed regulations seek to remove civil service protections from a new class of federal workers called Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) and make these workers at-will employees.  The proposed regulations state that the President would have sole authority to reclassify employees as P/C and that such employees would lose the ability to challenge the reclassification.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the implementation of the proposed Schedule F rule. As a scientist with professional experience in federally funded research, I am deeply concerned about the threat this rule poses to the integrity and credibility of the scientific grantmaking process.

Schedule F would allow political appointees to reclassify and remove career civil servants who play a critical role in evaluating scientific grant proposals. This change would open the door to political interference in a process that must remain impartial and evidence-based. Grant decisions are not political acts. Rather, they are determinations of scientific merit made by subject-matter experts and trained professionals who follow rigorous, peer-reviewed evaluation criteria.

It is a serious error to conflate grantmaking with policymaking. Grant assessments are not about advancing a political agenda. They are about supporting the most promising research based on established scientific standards. Shifting authority awa

Given that the administration didn‚Äôt seem to have a problem removing large swaths of the federal workforce, why are we focused on finding ways to make it even easier to remove federal employees?

They are gone now. Most were not fired in one sweep, but erased in increments. Reclassified. Reassigned. Removed.

It began with a rule. Not a war, not a riot. A rule. Simple, administrative, deceptively dull. They called it Schedule Career/Policy. Just enough words to sound important, just vague enough to sound harmless.

The rule allowed truth to be silenced gently, professionally, without fuss. It gave permission to power‚Äînot the honest kind, but the sort that curls inward like smoke. It allowed those who served the law to be replaced by those who served the man. And no one noticed‚Äînot really‚Äîuntil

   Text sample: I am a current federal employee with over a decade of service in a complex field. I believe that this proposed rule will weaken government effectiveness and efficiency. We already have mechanisms to address poor performers, we just need to revise and strengthen those mechanisms to address the problems that this rule attempts to address. This proposed rule misses the mark.

First, the rule as written will result in a loss of expertise and institutional knowledge. The changes that allow for the quick removal of experienced career employees in policy-influencing roles, even for perceived poor performance or misalignment, risks a significant loss of expertise. These ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù roles are often the individuals who possess a deep understanding of complex policy areas, historical context, and established agency processes. Their abrupt departure (which will undoubtedly happen after every election) could lead to policy inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and a need for constant retrainin

This regulation would immediately end over 140 years of non-partisan, merit-based civil service by undermining the Pendleton Act of 1883, which ended the Spoils System of Civil Service.

The rule seeks to address situations where employees "undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives." However, the meaning of this phrase is highly unclear.
What actions constitute "subverting" a directive? Does it include:
Disagreeing with the directive's policy implications?
Offering alternative interpretations of the directive's language?
Raising concerns about the directive's legality or feasibility?
Implementing the directive in a way that, while technically compliant, differs from a supervisor's expectations?

The term "intentionally" also raises questions. How is "intent" to be proven?

   Text sample: After reviewing the proposed rule, there appear to be significant constitutional concerns, particularly regarding due process, arising from the creation of "Schedule Policy/Career" and the removal of Chapter 43 and 75 protections for employees in those positions. The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly held that, when a cause is required to remove a public employee, due process is necessary to determine if that cause has been met. Neither Congress nor the President has the power to ignore or waive due process. The procedural rules that are being changed here were enacted to help ensure that adverse actions are taken in accordance with the Constitution and for proper cause.

The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees that no person shall "be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." This protection extends to government employment when an employee has a property interest in their job. As the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) explains, the right

Background:
I am in favor of civil service reform generally. I‚Äôve been a federal supervisor who has had to
remove more than one employee who was not doing their job. My agency‚Äôs human
resources team made the process almost impossible. With one exception, every federal
office that I have ever worked in had at least one poor performer who was not doing their
job, and nobody seemed willing to go through the process to fire them.
I also agree that there are a great many positions that are policy determining or policy
advocating positions that need to be easier to

This policy makes it easier to continue to illegally fire employees and shut down agencies without congressional input. POTUS requires obedience and allegiance to himself, not our constitution or country. POTUS doesn‚Äôt know if he must uphold our constitution. Now political loyalty would supercede expertise and directly impact services I need: Social Security, Medicare, national security, my beloved national parks, and much more.¬†

Agencies and institutions require experts with nonpartisan allegiance. Experts fired for presenting balanced considerations leads to bad policies that hurt Americans. We need protection from an increasingly authoritarian government and partisan outcomes. Guardrails must include civil-service protections NOT ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career" federal employees. We need civil servants with strong institutional knowledge, government expertise and efficiency, not workers who serve at the will of POTUS. Every new administration will

Dear Office of Personnel Management,
As a federal employee at a financial regulatory agency, and as a union member, I am writing in my personal capacity to express my strong opposition to the Proposed Rule 90 Fed. Reg. 17182.
My prior experience in the private sector exposed me to the detrimental effects of subjective performance evaluations, inconsistent salary structures for comparable work, and the dismissal of employee feedback. These issues fostered a climate of favoritism, high turnover, and ultimately led to leadership changes.
In contrast, my experience in federal service has demonstrated the value and fairness of the merit system, which safeguards employees from the instability of partisan politics. I have witnessed firsthand the integrity upheld within the civil service, where even minor instanc

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) proposed (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004) titled "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service." This proposed rule reclassifies ‚Äúpolicy-influencing positions‚Äù as Schedule Policy/Career, making them at-will and exempt from standard adverse action procedures and appeals, meaning that the positions are not protected by the standard civil service job protections which were put in place to prevent politicization of federal government positions. 
This rule would erode due process protections, allowing dedicated professionals to be fired based on political considerations rather than performance. Designating positions as Schedule Policy/Career significantly weakens accountability of agencies with respect to their federally mandated missions  and enables politically motivated removals of experienced civil servants.
The administration claims that this rule will allow for the swift removal of employees who en

I strongly oppose the reappearance ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees. Schedule F has been covertly re-inserted into this proposal under a different name.  The so-called ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù proposal simply changes the previous ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification into the ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù classification that still threatens the merit-based civil service system that has served as the foundation of our nonpartisan federal workforce.

‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù classification still undermines the basic core tenants of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. The whole point of that Act was designed to eliminate the spoils system that historically plagued this nation. In place of the spoils system, we got a merit-based hiring process that is no longer marred by partisanship. By allowing thousands of

Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004

To the Office of Personnel Management,

I strongly oppose proposed rule RIN 3206-AO80 (90 FR 17182). Creating "Schedule Policy/Career" to make "policy-influencing positions" at-will, thereby removing adverse action procedures and appeal rights, is a detrimental step for our civil service. It threatens the integrity, effectiveness, and non-partisan nature of federal employment. While "increasing career employee accountability" is a stated goal, this rule is a disproportionate and dangerous solution. It will inevitably lead to the politicization of vital government roles, the erosion of merit system principles, and the undermining of impartial administration of laws and regulations.
This rule directly attacks the foundational merit principles of our civil service, established by the Pendleton Act to protect against political coercion. By making "policy-influencing" roles at-wil

   Text sample: I am a federal employee who is concerned about the overacting issues with this proposed rule. The principle of separation of powers, as outlined in the U.S. Constitution, establishes a system of distinct roles and responsibilities for the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. This principle, along with the system of checks and balances, aims to prevent any single branch from accumulating excessive power. The proposed rule, which seeks to alter the employment status and procedural rights of certain federal employees, raises concerns about whether it oversteps the boundaries of executive authority and encroaches upon the legislative domain.

Congress has historically played a significant role in defining the terms and conditions of federal employment. Through legislation such as the Civil Service Reform Act, Congress has established the rights and protections of federal employees, including the procedures for adverse actions and appeals.

Not only are we under a president who has not worked hard a day in his life but was given "a small loan of a million dollars" to make something of himself. He would be no one if not for someone else's money. Yet the working man toils away and is rewarded with ridiculous layoffs and the stress of potentially losing the job they worked to obtain! That is ludicrous!!! A government is nothing without a people to govern, and if we can afford healthcare and food because of crazy layoffs, what do you think will happen?

I've worked in several areas within HHS across several administrations, and I've worked on a wide variety of topics ranging from Medicaid policy to FDA operations. In my work at CMS in Medicaid, I worked on the Medicaid Financial Accountability Rule (MFAR), which we similarly submitted for comment several years ago. That rule never made it to Final Rule due to political pressure placed on the rule from various sources. 

How you define which role is considered a policy role and what is purely operations?

The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 established that hiring people to work in the United States federal government would be based on merit, thus replacing a corrupt patronage system.  The Pendleton Act specified that federal employees should be hired on the basis of what they know rather than who they know.  Advancement and promotions were to be based on actual achievement and meeting performance goals, not based on campaign contributions, votes delivered, or political considerations.

   Text sample: As a current federal employee, the proposed rule's reliance on the term "policy-influencing positions" as the basis for altering the employment status and procedural rights of federal employees is deeply problematic due to the term's inherent vagueness. I‚Äôve spoken with numerous federal employees and nobody can really figure out what this means. It could apply to only a handful of political appointees (as it should), or be incorrectly and broadly applied to hundreds of thousands of federal employees. 

This lack of a clear and precise definition creates several significant concerns. This needs to be fixed in the final rule. The problems with vagueness are twofold: (1) The undefined scope ‚Äì the rule fails to provide specific criteria or standards for determining what constitutes a "policy-influencing position." It does not delineate the level of responsibility, the degree of influence on policy outcomes, or the types of duties that would qualify a position as "policy-influencing." This

If an employee is reclassified into this broad policy-influencing category, they will be subject to the Schedule Policy/Career rules. Schedule Policy/Career rules allow a covered employee to be terminated without cause or due process, such as appeals to the MSPB. OPM estimates that 50,000 positions would be moved into Schedule Policy/Career category. In January, OPM  issued guidance to agencies asking them to interpret the category of policy-influencing positions broadly to include employees in positions who make grant-making decisions, work on proposed regulations or guidance, work in legislative affairs, or advocate for agencies

These changes serve to influence federal employees to work for political reasons and not as a public servant as has been the tradition for many federal positions and roles for decades. The Schedule F designation is specifically for permanent policy-related positions, of which many agencies do not fall under. Reclassifying these positions to Schedule F will no longer allow these federal employees to serve the American public and to put the people's needs first. Many agencies, such as those under the Department of the Interior, like the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service, or under the Health and Human Services, such as the CDC or NIH, serve public lands or public health, neither of which should be subject to the political leanings of the executive branch.

Regarding the legal authority of the present action, it is notable that it relies substantially on Presidential authority (EO 14171) to change multiple sections of the regulations (CFR), in contrast with the final rule 89 FR 24982 which, after public notice and comment, determined that the presently proposed changes were not in the public interest based only on application of the US Code as enacted by Congress. It is notable that executive orders have been sparingly applied, such as for intern programs, since the major 5 USC reforms of the 1960's.

I am writing to express my strong concerns regarding the proposed regulation to classify certain federal employees as ‚Äúat-will‚Äù under the new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù category. While I understand the intent to increase accountability among senior personnel, this proposal raises serious issues relating to fairness, constitutional protections, and the continued functionality of a professional civil service.

1. Unjust Takings of Accrued Benefits
The proposed rule effectively constitutes a taking of employees' accrued stakes in federal retirement and pension systems. Many civil servants accepted government positions‚Äîoften at a reduced salary compared to the private sector‚Äîbased on the promise of long-term employment protections and a stable retirement plan.

I respectfully submit this comment in opposition to the proposed Schedule Policy (reinstatement or rebranding of Schedule F), as outlined in Federal Register Document Number 2025-06904. I believe the rule is legally problematic and inconsistent with foundational civil service statutes and protections.
1. Conflict with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978

The Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978 establishes a merit-based system of employment and protects civil servants from arbitrary dismissal. The proposed Schedule Policy appears to bypass these statutory protections by reclassifying certain positions as "policy-determining" or "confidential" and stripping employees of competitive service protections without due process.

    5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301 outlines the merit system principles, including fair and equitable treatment and protection against arbitrary action or personal favoritism. The Schedule Policy risks undermining these principles.

Public Comment regarding Docket #: OPM-2025-0004-0001
Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service1
Introduction
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing a rule titled: Improving, Performance,
Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.2 The proposed rule places civil servants
into a new exempt status. The result of this involuntary reclassification is a transition into an ‚Äúat
will‚Äù status. Employees can be terminated without due process. In the past, due process rights
of federal employees and others have been legislated by Congressional labor laws and
supported by courts.
I do not support this rule.
If enacted, this rule will be challenged in the courts. The time and money spent by OPM and all
the agencies that enact this rule will amount to millions of dollars adding to the federal deficit
and ultimately paid for by the pu

   Text sample: To the officials of the Office of Personnel Management, 
The proposed changes to Schedule F now Schedule Policy/Career that would convert an estimated 50,000 civil servants to at-will political appointees would be devastating to the ability of the US to compete with China. I am a research scientist in at Michigan State University, and was a program officer at the National Science Foundation twenty years ago. Non-political appointees working at our federal agencies funding biological and physical sciences research have led the US to become the world's top research enterprise, leading to uncountable numbers of breakthroughs directly impacting human health, agriculture, and technology. Dedicated and hard working program officers at NSF, DOE and NIH use community member input to inform funding decisions by these agencies. Replacing them with with political appointees would weaken our competitiveness with China. We see the impacts of political meddling in these agencies arbitrary layoffs, p

   Text sample: I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed rule titled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù (Docket No. 2025-06904), which includes the repeal of Civil Service Rule 2.4 and lays the groundwork for the possible reimplementation of a Schedule F classification. As a career civil servant who believes deeply in the nonpartisan merit-based principles that undergird the U.S. civil service, I believe this rule poses serious risks to the fairness, integrity, and effectiveness of the federal workforce.

1. Repeal of Civil Service Rule 2.4 and Potential Resurrection of Schedule F
The repeal of Rule 2.4 is deeply troubling because it eliminates a key safeguard that helps protect civil servants from being arbitrarily classified in ways that can circumvent due process and merit protections. This change reopens the door to Schedule F, a proposal originally designed to reclassify thousands of federal employees as ‚Äúexcepted service‚Äù with limite

   Text sample: This comment pertains to the proposed OPM rule, Docket ID OPM-2025-0004 and RIN 3206-AO80.

I am a researcher in an academic laboratory, and am already beginning to feel the threat of the sharp increase in political polarization this rule could bring about, particularly with regards to the inclusion of workers with "Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking" in the P/C class. Allowing so many partisan political appointees to be switched out at every level of the NIH and NSF every four years will lead to a drastically inefficient system in which no one person will gain any meaningful amount of experience, and the overall scientific goals of the country will change so frequently that it will become increasingly impossible to make any meaningful amount of progress on any of them.

As a former federal employee and a career public servant, I strongly oppose the reimplementation of Schedule F as proposed in Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service."  
When I was hired by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2005, I had to compete with a large number of applicants in a nationwide, merit-based competition.  There was no political interference in the hiring process.  This is as it should be: a merit-based system designed to bring into federal civil service the best and brightest.  This is what the American public deserves and expects.  My career at EPA challenged me to be the best I could be, and a standard of excellence was maintained by a workforce of hard-working, competent and dedicated professionals.
Earlier in my career, I also worked for 20 years for the State of Illinois in a variety of positions.  While the vast maj

   Comment IDs: OPM-2025-0004-14487
   Text sample: This rule does nothing to clarify the definition of policy roles. There are many positions that would fall into this ambiguous classification when they shouldn't. For example, a Grants Officer can obligate the government but they have rules and regulations to follow, they don't implement policy. Writing policies for how operational procedures (Acquisitions, IT, etc) are implemented isn't the same level of policy as programmatic priorities where the employee has a say in agency level actions. 
This rule is also long and convoluted. It refuses to acknowledge that we already have processes in place to manage performance. If the administration wants to edit those procedures, it should work with OPM to issue rules regarding the length and standards of performance improvement plans rather than making all employees vulnerable to partisan leadership or personal vendettas. 
Government employees, especially specialized workers with higher education, earn less income than their private sector cou

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule titled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù, as published in the Federal Register on April 23, 2025. My concern specifically centers on the potential reclassification of federal employees involved in discretionary grantmaking-positions that must remain impartial and shielded from political influence to maintain the integrity of federal programs.
Politicization of Grantmaking
This rule could open the door to the politicization of federal discretionary grant programs, many of which are designed to support underserved communities, fund scientific research, and advance critical public policy goals. Federal employees responsible for administering and awarding these grants must be insulated from political pressure to ensure decisions are made based on merit, public need, and statutory in

   Text sample: Schedule F describes its stated purpose as to "allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives". However, it seems unlikely that the proposed rule will have this effect.

A core principle of democracy in the United States is the system of checks and balances. Numerous Presidential directives have been identified as unconstitutional or in opposition to the democratic process by legislators, courts, the general public, or all three. It is not necessarily the case that compliance with all Presidential directives will be the most effective way to ensure the stability of the democratic process. For example, if the President were to issue an Executive Order declaring that federal elections will be suspended and current office-holders will retain their posts indefinitely, then non-compliance with the Presidential directive would be in support of

   Text sample: I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule titled ‚ÄúCareer Civil Service Protections for Policy-Determining, Policymaking, or Policy-Advocating Positions‚Äù, which would establish the new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù federal employment classification.

This proposal would undermine long-standing civil service protections by allowing sweeping reclassification of federal employees into an ‚Äúat-will‚Äù employment status, where they could be terminated without cause or due process. Such a change would violate the principles of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was enacted to ensure that federal employees are hired and retained based on merit, not politics.

The proposed rule is excessively broad and vague. The term ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù is undefined and open to expansive interpretation, potentially covering tens of thousands of employees ‚Äî including career professionals whose roles have nothing to do with political decision-making. Reclassifying these positions would

The sciences should not be part of politics. Health care is too important for everyone to have NIH Institute Directors and Center Directors became political appointees. Their job is to keep their respective institute or center running smoothly. Politics has nothing to do with it and could endanger future health research and innovation. We already have examples of particular branches of health research being eliminated or restricted. This will have a devastating impact on the everyday lives of Americans. The NIH Directors and Center Directors need to be free of political interference to make sure Americans get the benefits of health research they deserve.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the rule proposed by the Office of Personnel Management 04/23/25 titled "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" (Office of Personnel Management 5 CFR Parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, and 752 [Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004] RIN 3206-AO80), also known as Schedule F.

Since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, our federal government has continued to move in the direction of more transparency and accountability, based on the conviction that federal employees should be hired and promoted based on their expertise and their performance, not on their political loyalty. President Theodore Roosevelt built upon the Reform Act and oversaw the number of merit-based employees surpass the number of patronage employees for the first time in our country‚Äôs history.  He eliminated political assessments and helped modernize the civil service into the dedicated, highly qualified workforce we enjoy today.

   Text sample: This proposal includes the following statement: "Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipiehts. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions." 


Framing grantmaking as policy via this regulatory approach will inevitably degrade the scientific rigor of established grant review processes. Scientific grants should be evaluated by nonpartisan career civil servants with appropriate expertise and experience, dedicated to the long term mission of their agencies.

   Text sample: Having worked in both the private sector and later as an HR Director for DoD I witnessed first hand the work ethic on both sides - while there are always individuals on both sides that are "non-performers" - in general I found that the government employees were more goal oriented and hard working.  While the summary of the change sounds positive - there is NO reason to trust what will be done with this change.  

When a person becomes a government employee that are signing up for a specific position under a specific set of rules - often for less pay than their private sector counterparts.  The administration and specifically DOGE seem to have little to NO understanding of government employment (other than what is currently benefitting them) and are now trying to make changes to HELP them "dump" more people into the Unemployed bucket.  This is essentially "breaking the contract" made with individuals for NO reason.  Non performers can and are fired from government - through a process.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule changes under OPM-2025-0004-0001. As a recently laid-off federal contractor who was providing technical assistance to USAID on climate risk and resilience, and as a mother and the primary breadwinner in my household, I have a unique perspective on the negative consequences this rule would have on federal agencies and the individuals who rely on them. From both my experience as a federal contractor and as a private citizen, I urge the administration to withdraw this rule.
It's no surprise that political transitions inevitably affect programmatic priorities and high-level appointments. However, the continuity of technically skilled staff across administrations‚Äîregardless of party‚Äîis critical to ensuring that vital services and programs continue to serve the public effectively. The proposed rule threatens to introduce mass staff turnover driven by po

I recently held a federal position at a science agency that was identified as potentially subject to this reclassification.

Docket ID:OPM-2025-0004 is harmful to Americans. 

Two weeks ago I waited on the phone for longer than 120 minutes to get my questions answered by social security, due to staffing cuts. I was ultimately unable to talk to anyone, even to make an appointment. So I have to go in without an appointment and make one, so that I can help my mom, who has worked full time since 1980, get the social security benefits she has paid into. Which will mean I have to take time off. Many Americans are facing these efficiency issues due to existing and ongoing cuts, and it's eroding our faith in government and our trust that our tax dollars are being used for our benefit.

Now those are small inconveniences due to the Trump regimes hasty firings. Making it possible to fire 50,000 more workers will cause thousands of more small inconveniences, and it is undermining the morale of current federal workers- making the departments less effective. My husband is a federal w

   Text sample: On behalf of the Biophysical Society [BPS], and the thousands of research scientists we represent, the proposed rule, OPM-2025-0004, to reclassify tens of thousands of government positions as ‚Äòpolicymaking‚Äô presents a conflict ‚Äì not only in how the proposal is constructed, but in its overall aim. As stated in the proposed rule, the goal of reclassifying these positions into Schedule F is to ensure that (a) the White House has more flexibility to terminate employees without potential for appeal, (b) to remove political influence from these positions and (c) to control how federal funding is allocated within agencies. 

Adjusting select federal employees to Schedule F would hardly reduce political influence, as those positions would now be filled by Executive appointment.

Re: Comment on Docket ID OPM-2025-0004

I am writing to express strong opposition to any proposed reclassification or treatment of scientific positions within the federal civil service that would subject them to political influence or undermine their career protections.

Science is based on facts, not politics. Federal scientists play a critical role in informing policy decisions by providing objective, evidence-based information. Classifying these professionals as ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù misrepresents their role and opens the door to political interference in the scientific process. The information scientists provide does not fluctuate based on which political party controls the White House‚Äîfacts remain constant even as administrations change.

Accountability  is essential for all Federal employees, but it is especially important for those who are in policy-influencing positions.  These personnel are entrusted to shape and implement actions that have a significant impact on all Americans.  Any power they have is delegated by the President, and they must be accountable to the President, who is the only member of the executive branch, other than the Vice President, elected and directly accountable to the American people.  In recent years, however, there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career Federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.  Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining,

I have received federal funding in support of my research, provided peer reviews for countless proposals, served on review panels, and mentored undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers receiving federal support for their education and research. I have believed for decades that the strength and success of the US research endeavor - I think it is fair to say that we have led the global scientific community for decades - arose in major part because of the lack of political interference in grants assessment and the overall integrity of the award process.

   Text sample: I am opposed to the federal rule change proposing to abolish the federal civil service and replacing it with what is basically a patronage system. As a former Professor of American history, I have researched and taught the history of this country, including civics, for decades. This proposed rule change is precisely NOT what the founding fathers wanted -- in fact, it is exactly what they attempted to prevent while writing the Constitution.

Supporters of Schedule F have proposed converting 50,000 career civil servants into political appointee status. That is a massive degree of additional politicization, and the most fundamental change to the civil service system since its inception in 1883. Increasing the number of political appointees would create a new venue where political polarization would undermine the quality of governance by replacing moderates with extremists.

   Text sample: 1. Legal Authority and Statutory Interpretation

The proposed rule appears to conflict with established statutory protections under Title 5 of the U.S. Code, particularly Chapters 43 and 75, which govern performance-based actions and adverse actions, respectively. By reclassifying positions into Schedule P/C and removing these protections, OPM may be exceeding its regulatory authority, as these statutes were enacted by Congress to ensure fair treatment of federal employees. The abrupt removal of due process rights without clear legislative backing could be deemed ultra vires and subject to legal challenge. 

2. Administrative Procedure Act (APA) Concerns

   Text sample: This proposal is contrary to a non-partisan civil service workforce that takes an oath of office to uphold the constitution of the United States.

I am concerned that this regulation would reclassify thousands of jobs that once fell under civil service protection and were filled based on expertise and experience, not by political appointment. 

Of particular concern to me, as a professional member of the research community, is the following proposed language (included on page 17188), which states:

"Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions."

Civil servants who have training and experience in implementing federal regulations and using federal data and financial systems provide expertise to the political appointees who need guidance with any administration‚Äôs priorities.  If the civil servants fear being fired for stating that something is against rule of law, many costly financial errors will occur.  For example, a political appointee might prefer to use a private jet to fly to a location that involves a place change if flying commercial but that violates government travel policy.  A civilian knowing the rules can prevent the use of illegal transportation because they know the rules. This check and balance between appointees and civilians is key to the efficient and legal operation of the government.

I respectfully submit this comment to express strong opposition to the proposed rule published on April 23, 2025, which would enable widespread reclassification of career federal civil servants into at-will employees. This proposal would fundamentally undermine the merit-based federal civil service, weaken constitutional protections for employees, and threaten the stability and integrity of government operations. I've outlined six key concerns below for your consideration.
1. The Proposed Rule Violates Constitutional Due Process Requirements
The federal government is bound by the U.S. Constitution, including the Fifth Amendment‚Äôs guarantee that no person shall be deprived of "life, liberty, or property without due process of law." Federal civil servants possess a property interest in continued employment under existing law and regulation. Characterizing constitutional due process protections as "cumbersome" does not justify their elimination. Streamlining admini

Public service at its best must be nonpartisan and collaborative.  As specified in the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883,  federal employees should be hired on the basis of what they know rather than who they know.  Advancement based on actual achievement and performance goals will establish a system of fairness and trust.  And acknowledgement of employees‚Äô knowledge and expertise will bring greater satisfaction and employee stability to the civil service. 

I am in full agreement with the  OPM‚Äôs mission statement on its website: ‚ÄúA strong, merit-based civil service is critical to a functioning democracy. It ensures that our government ‚Äúof the people, by the people, for the peopl

The federal civil service exists to ensure that the government is administered competently, lawfully, and in the public interest. By allowing mass reclassification of career civil servants into political positions without the usual due process protections, Schedule F undermines those goals. It substitutes allegiance to constitutional principles with allegiance to a single political actor. That is not compatible with a functioning democracy.

I urge the agency to answer the following:

1. How does the agency reconcile this rule with the longstanding constitutional principle that the Executive Branch must faithfully execute the laws passed by Congress‚Äînot reinterpret or ignore them based on political loyalty?

Overly Broad Statutory Construction
The designation of "policy-influencing" positions as Schedule P/C constitutes an impermissibly broad interpretation that potentially exceeds statutory authority. As evidenced by Social Security Administration leadership's stated intent to reclassify nearly all career employees under this schedule, the rule lacks sufficient limiting principles to prevent arbitrary and capricious application across federal agencies. The absence of clear demarcation between positions already properly classified under the Senior Executive Service (SES) and newly designated Schedule P/C positions creates significant administrative redundancy without statutory justification. Furthermore, the rule's failure to provide adequate guidance for consistent cross-agency implementation violates administrative law principles requiring reasoned decision-making.

RE: Schedule F Executive Order Change
Docket ID OPM ‚Äì 2025-0004
RIN (3206 ‚Äì A080)
It is the purpose of government employees to serve the American
public. It is my belief that government employees take their
responsibility to serve the public very seriously.
It is not the responsibility of government employees to only serve the
desires of the president as proposed in Schedule F. The president has
taken an oath to represent everyone in the country. Those serving
under him are expected to do the same.
The President is not a king and those working in the government are
not his personal servants.
In my experience, government employees are highly educated and
dedicated to serving their respected agencies.
It is my understanding that current employees are high performers in
their positions and many have institutional memory, which also adds
value to the problem-solving and decision-making processes of their
agencies.

The proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù would question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for our economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and many other statistics. The federal statistical system plays an important role in improving the lives of all Americans as well as informing critical policy decisions with evidence that is timely, relevant, and accurate. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule because of the following:

   Text sample: The concept of "weaponizing" federal employees and the associated "Schedule F" policy raises significant concerns about the potential for political influence within the civil service. This reclassification would remove existing civil service protections, making it easier to hire and fire these employees. This would effectively turn these positions into political appointments, allowing for greater political influence over the federal bureaucracy. Politicization of the Civil Service: Schedule F undermines the merit-based system, where federal employees are hired and promoted based on qualifications, not political loyalty. The fear is that federal employees would become more susceptible to political pressure, potentially compromising their ability to provide impartial advice and carry out their duties objectively. This could lead to political purges and the replacement of experienced professionals with loyalists, damaging the efficiency and effectiveness of government agencies. The idea t

This is based on my service as Director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 2003-2011.

Effectively serving as an Institute and Centers Director (as well as a Division Director below them) requires a large amount of scientific knowledge and experience. Policy development does depends on a strong factual and scientific basis and the priorities for science do not vary rapidly over time. New opportunities and technologies emerge over time and some opportunities become less pressing due to advances. But these events are adequately covered with the existing civil service structure. The NIH Director is a political appointee and is able to communicate priorities of the administration effectively to others at NIH quite effectively, in my experience.

   Text sample: Dear Office of Personnel Management,

I am writing to express strong support for the preservation and advancement of a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service, which is essential to the effective delivery of services to the American public.

Impartiality and Public Trust

At the heart of good governance is the public‚Äôs trust that federal employees will carry out their duties with fairness, integrity, and professionalism‚Äîregardless of which political party holds office. A nonpartisan civil service ensures that government programs and services are administered based on the law and the public interest, not on political loyalty. This promotes continuity, stability, and confidence in government institutions.

Competence Over Patronage

Hiring and promotion based on merit ensures that the most qualified and capable individuals serve the public. This leads to better decision-making, more efficient operations, and higher-quality services. Replacing this system with political patronage would sac

The Spoils System was in effect from 1829 to 1881.  I ask: do we really want to return to that method of filling civil service positions? I vote no.  Has our country learned nothing from its history?  The Spoils System jeopardized the continuity of government.  It required that we "reinvent the wheel" with every change of administration because it suppressed the building of institutional knowledge which is necessary for effective governance.  Ultimately, it made our country more vulnerable during transitions of power and national emergencies.

Schedule F is just another name for The Spoils System.  Under that system, political supporters and party members of each newly elected president are rewarded for their efforts with government jobs, often regardless of their qualifications.  As a prime example, I point to the unqualified candidates that President Trump chose to serve as the Secretaries in his Cabinet.  We are curre

A professional, apolitical civil service ensures continuity, accountability, and integrity in government operations. Civil servants are the backbone of programs that provide healthcare to veterans, ensure food safety, protect our environment, process Social Security benefits, support national security, and countless other essential services.

This helps maintain equal access to government jobs for all citizens, regardless of political beliefs, and ensures services are provided fairly to everyone.

2. **Continuity and Stability:** Unlike elected officials who change with election cycles, career civil servants provide continuity in government operations. A nonpartisan civil service maintains institutional knowledge and ensures that essential services‚Äîlike Social Security, public health, and emergency response‚Äîare delivered reliably, regardless of political shifts.

   Text sample: I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule titled *"Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service." This initiative threatens to unravel the very foundation of merit-based governance that has guided our federal workforce for over a century.

To understand the dangers of this rule, we must look to history. In the late 19th century, the federal government was plagued by the *spoils system*, in which public jobs were handed out as political favors. This system culminated in tragedy with the assassination of President James A. Garfield in 1881 by a disgruntled office seeker. His death shocked the nation and galvanized support for reform.

In response, the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 was enacted, creating a merit-based system designed to ensure that federal employees are hired and retained based on competence, not political loyalty. This act was a cornerstone of good governance, designed to insulate public servants from partisan politic

Adjusting select federal employees to Schedule F would impose more undue partisan influence on the grantmaking process than leaving the current structure in place. The purpose and intent of scientific research is to expand, explore, and provide benefits to the American people. Scientific research is best performed in an apolitical atmosphere. Adding yet another layer of federally appointed Schedule F employees would contradict the proposed smaller, more efficient government outlined by the Administration. Furthermore, this system would likely increase turnover of government positions with each new administration, which would reduce efficiency. Science and scientific research are nonpartisan issues that should remain nonpartis

The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 established that hiring people to work in the United States federal government would be based on merit, thus replacing a corrupt patronage system.  In other words, the Pendleton Act specified that federal employees should be hired on the basis of what they know rather than who they know.  Advancement and promotions were to be based on actual achievement and meeting performance goals, not based on campaign contributions, votes delivered, or political considerations.

This rule, if implemented, would represent a significant and detrimental shift in federal employment, harming dedicated public servants and risking the politicization of positions that are, and should remain, non-partisan.
This proposed rule is deeply concerning for federal employees for several critical reasons:
First, the reclassification of a potentially vast number of federal positions into a new "at-will" employment category would strip tens of thousands of dedicated civil servants of their hard-earned due process rights and appeal protections.

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the proposed Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) classification rule. As a citizen who has closely followed public administration issues for many years and who relies on effective government services, I believe this proposal would severely undermine the federal workforce's ability to serve the American public efficiently, objectively, and effectively.

My family and I depend on numerous federal services that require experienced, knowledgeable staff who can make decisions based on facts and established policies rather than political considerations. My elderly father receives Social Security benefits, and I have witnessed firsthand how important it is to have career civil servants who understand the complex regulations and can provide consistent service regardless of which party controls the White House. If these positions become politicized through the Sc

   Text sample: The rule proposed by Office of Personnel Management to reinstate Schedule F will greatly expand the number, scale, and definition of employees who are subject to termination as a result of a Presidential transition. I oppose it for these reasons:
1) Agency employees should be loyal to the USA, not a political party or Presidential administration.
2)Agency employees should be motivated to serve the needs of the American public, not a political party or any particular Presidential administration. 
3) Our country should offer federal employment that attracts highly capable people and encourage their continuing professional competence by offering the opportunity for longevity in employment. If they are subject to termination each time there is a Presidential transition, it makes it difficult for career-minded employees to plan their lives, including buying a home, employment of spouses, and consistency in education for their children.

   Text sample: Neither the POTUS nor his political team are experts across every discipline. That professionalism resides with Americans who dedicate their lives to a field. Regardless of how any one person feels about any one administration, the United States CANNOT be a country where one individual or select group of individuals can impose their will on the entire country. An independent, non-partisan federal workforce is a major aspect of that. If any POTUS can replace large numbers of federal workers with loyalists rather than professionals who possess the expertise to know when to push back on an administration, harm will be done to American citizens. We already have the tools necessary to hire, monitor, and, if needed, dismiss a federal employee in the interest of the American public. If a particular agency or the government at large is unwilling to follow that process, or is otherwise too lazy or impatient and seeks to expedite that due process, then that is another problem entirely that the o

   Text sample: As a responsible citizen, I can hardly believe proposed changes that would weaken rules for career federal employees put in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty, so that we have a federal government that functions competently and with continuity across administrations. 

Undermining this system returns us to the 1800's era when government jobs were awarded through the spoils system, opening up patronage, cronyism, and nepotism, destroying the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are experienced and knowledgeable in their jobs, individuals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Making it easier to replace them with politically aligned individuals will degrade the competency and effectiveness of federal services and programs. Further, it could allow the insertion of individuals that have an ideological agenda, steering fe

I am a concerned citizen. I know that many government programs and initiatives are very specialized and niche, and rely on the institutional knowledge that long-term employees offer. To make so many more positions politicized would make them prone to turnover with every administration, which could mean the loss of this valuable knowledge. This would mean the services suffer. For example, in Federal programs which are run by States, such as SNAP, it is important that the Federal level employees are expert on all matters pertaining to the program, since State agencies will seek guidance from them. If these staff are prone to turnover every few years, they may both be much less expert on the program, as well as the program may lose continuity for participants.

I am also concerned that such a change would mean employees may be afraid to express alternative viewpoints, which would stifle creativity, readiness, innovation, an

   Text sample: There are many practical concerns with rescheduling federal employees to be Schedule F.  To begin with, this could affect up to 50,000 employees.  Many of these employees are in high-level roles and have a lot of institutional knowledge.  Replacing experienced government employees with political appointees risks reducing or even eliminating vital institutional knowledge that is vital to keeping the government running smoothly. 

Reclassifying federal employees as Schedule F will also lead to inefficiency and ineffectiveness as employees with political loyalty will be prioritized over competence and experience.  This will decrease the quality of government services. 

Reclassifying federal employees as Schedule F will also harm recruitment.  After all, who is going to want to apply for a job that they may not get to keep after each administration?  If an applicant is worried that the current administration may not stay in place for more than 4-8 years, then they may look for more stable

The answer is that this must not be a political accountability, but rather accountability of competence and productivity. Politicians and OMB are not the best judges of this, because they are beholden to politics. If you look back at why the US built a highly-competent federal workforce, it is because the federal government takes on complex and generally un-sexy tasks that require expertise and knowledge. The grunt workers of those tasks are civil servants and the expert supervisory staff that manage their work. Those who work in leadership at federal agencies are the best judges of civil servants‚Äô productivity and competence, and as such should be those tasked with making sure that their agencies and staff are accountable and responsive. They, as they do, then report to the Congress. 

So yes, look at the protections of civil servants, work with federal employees‚Äô unions and come up with strategies that

To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing to submit a public comment in strong opposition to the proposed
reinstatement or expansion of Schedule F within the federal civil service. While I
understand the administrative desire for flexibility, the introduction of Schedule F poses
grave risks to the nonpartisan integrity and stability of our government workforce.
Schedule F, as originally issued in Executive Order 13957 (which was later rescinded),
sought to reclassify policy-influencing positions as at-will appointmeen(cid:431)tse‚Äîctively
undermining the merit-based protections that have underpinned the civil service since the
Pendleton Act. Reinstating it woulndot only reduce accountability but also increase
politicization at multiple layers of federal agencies.

Labor Statistics informs policy outcomes with neutral data modeling, is

   Text sample: I am writing to comment on the proposed rule Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service OPM-2025-0004-0001 and express strong opposition to any attempt to implement or reinstate a Schedule F classification within the federal workforce. This measure fundamentally threatens the principles of a professional, nonpartisan civil service, a system that has been central to our democracy for over 100 years.
Schedule F would essentially dismantle critical civil service protections by allowing policymakers to reclassify broad categories of career federal employees (especially those in policy-related roles) making them subject to dismissal without the safeguards currently in place. This approach directly contradicts the intent of the Pendleton Act of 1883, which was designed to prevent partisan favoritism in public employment and ensure that hiring and firing decisions are made based on merit.
Such a reclassification scheme runs afoul of key provisions in federal

   Text sample: This language gives the administration extensive authority to fire anyone it deems a threat to its partisan agenda and provides little comfort for those willing to speak out about unlawful or unethical actions. The way the executive order is worded even suggests that the Constitution may require federal employees to follow any order given. 

This raises the question of whether failure to ‚Äúfaithfully implement administration policies‚Äù will put a target on anyone who defends scientific integrity, disseminates accurate public health advice, publicizes truthful weather reports, targets real national security threats, or otherwise speaks honestly, even when it isn‚Äôt what the administration wants to hear.

thank you so much for your hard work. I am an economist who works with public data. It is imperative to my work that all federal datasets continue being published uninterrupted and unmolested. Although federal datasets occasionally publish negative numbers, these data points are enormously useful in studying the economy and potentially predicting future turning points. I think of economic data like a diagnosis: although we would all prefer to only hear good news from our doctors, it is ultimately beneficial to know if you have cancer. Although upsetting, bad news can recommend treatment or a cure. But if you refrain from ever going to the doctor, you may never know what ails you. More importantly, avoiding a doctor's diagnosis does not prevent the cancer from killing you. But if you do know, you may receive treatment and live.

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. The proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù would call into question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for our economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and many other statistics. The federal statistical system plays an essential role in improving the lives of all Americans as well as informing critical policy decisions with evidence that is timely, relevant, and accurate. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule due to the following:

   Text sample: I write in opposition to the rule proposed by the Personnel Management Office on 04/23/25 titled "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" (Office of Personnel Management 5 CFR Parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, and 752 [Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004] RIN 3206-AO80).

The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 established that hiring people to work in the United States federal government would be based on merit, thus replacing a corrupt patronage system.  In other words, the Pendleton Act specified that federal employees should be hired on the basis of what they know rather than who they know.  Advancement and promotions were to be based on actual achievement and meeting performance goals, not based on campaign contributions, votes delivered, or political considerations. 

We have seen nationally and in cities like my own city of New York how a "spoils system" or a patronage system is corrosive to the human spirit leading to elevation of incompeten

   Text sample: I am strongly opposed to the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) proposed rule titled "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" Docket ID (OPM-2025-0004) and RIN (3206-AO80). The proposal to reclassify policy-influencing positions as Schedule Policy/Career, will politicize government functions, degrade government expertise and efficiency, and severely compromise delivery of public services. 

I may be in a federal position at a federal agency that is identified as potentially subject to this proposed rule. Effectiveness in my position, and many others proposed for reclassification, requires specialized knowledge and skills that take years to develop. Reclassifying large numbers of federal employees to ‚Äúat-will‚Äù workers will make it difficult to recruit skilled employees, lead to large turnover in employees, and result in major disruptions to public service.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed rule titled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004). This rule threatens to politicize the federal civil service, undermining the merit-based principles that have ensured effective and impartial governance for over a century.

Politicization of Science and Policy

By reclassifying approximately 50,000 positions into the new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù category‚Äîformerly known as Schedule F‚Äîthe proposal effectively renders these roles at-will, stripping employees of critical protections under Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5. This change disproportionately affects positions in science, data analysis, and policy development, making them vulnerable to political interference. Reclassifying civil servants in scientific and statistical roles undermines the integrity of evidence-based policy by exposing these functions to partisan influence.

Federal acquisition personnel are responsible for complying with a plethora of laws and regulations that have been put into place to ensure accountability and to avoid fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayer money. Contracting officers and procurement staff are held to a high standard of professional integrity, and they often must resist pressure from agency leadership and outside vendors to protect the integrity of the procurement process. Without the protections that come with being non-partisan, career civil servants, these employees would not be able to enforce these high standards. They would be coerced to make purchase decisions on multi-million-dollar contracts based on politics, not on the best interests of the taxpayers. This would lead to many billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse, which this administration is supposedly trying to eliminate.

   Text sample: I am opposed to the rule that would allow career civil servants to be replaced with political appointees. David Lewis finds in his 2008 book The Politics of Presidential Appointments that appointees are less competent than career civil servants. The bureaucracy would not only lose integral institutional knowledge, but bureaucratic efficiency would decrease with less competent employees. Furthermore, increasing the number of political appointees will increase the number of vacancies in the federal bureaucracy. A significant number of the existing 4,000 presidential appointees remain vacant for months, in some cases years. These vacancies will only increase with a growth in the number of appointed positions. Increased vacancies will result in a decrease in bureaucratic capacity and efficiency.

   Text sample: Legal and Constitutional Concerns

- The proposed rule, which effectively revives and expands the concept of "Schedule F" (here named "Schedule Policy/Career"), undermines over a century of bipartisan consensus supporting a professional, apolitical civil service. By making thousands of policy-influencing positions "at-will," the rule directly contradicts the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which established merit-based hiring to end patronage. 

- The reclassification strips employees of procedural protections guaranteed under the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) and the Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912, both of which require just cause and due process for terminations. The Supreme Court has affirmed in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill that public employees have a property interest in their jobs and must receive notice and a hearing before dismissal. Allowing at-will dismissals without these safeguards raises serious constitutional and statutory issues

Because, per the language in this regulation, agencies, including the NIH will be able to "quickly remove employees from critical positions who...undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives" employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may suddenly be seen to occupy policymaking positions.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed changes that would literally weaken the stability of our government. Rules like this are in place to reduce employee churn, thereby INCREASING GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY.Undermining this system will allow the civil service jobs to be political in nature. In addition, if civil service were politicized, large swathes of federal workers would, in all likelihood, get replaced with every president. The government would cease to be able to function at a level that would even resemble efficiency. Stability would be nearly unattainable and thereby would actual hurt the economy as companies would not want to invest in the United States, knowing that a continuous cycle of upheaval would happen frequently.

Introduction
I write based on my 25 years of experience working as a nonprofit employee and consultant with government-adjacent organizations, including museums, libraries, and universities. Throughout my career, I've collaborated with federal employees across multiple administrations whose expertise has been vital to the success of public institutions. I submit this comment in my personal capacity to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule.
The Rule Relies on Insufficient Evidence
This proposed rule makes sweeping changes to civil service protections based on evidence that simply doesn't support such dramatic action. The rule relies heavily on cherry-picked data and anecdotes rather than comprehensive evidence.
For example, in the Merit Principles Survey cited in paragraph 177, OPM highlights that only 41 percent of supervisors are confident they could remove a subordinate for serious misconduct and just

   Text sample: I am a federal employee commenting in my personal capacity. I am opposed to this rule for several reasons.

First, OPM is wrong in asserting that federal employees engaged in misconduct or poor performance are too difficult to fire. I have worked on my union board for several years. There have been multiple instances where employees have engaged in gross misconduct (e.g., physical altercations, visiting inappropriate websites). These employees were promptly, and rightly, terminated even with the existing appeal rights. I have also seen poor performers who have been terminated, all without the need for this new at-will scheme. 

Second, OPM is wrong that career employees act in a partisan manner. I have served under three administrations, and each time I have never witnessed anyone stymying the will of the current administration. We know as civil servants that we will at some time or another work for an president whom we did not vote for, and we are bound to enact their agenda to the be

RE: "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service," 
Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004

Dear Office of Personnel Management:

I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule because it will:

1) Erode the government's merit-based hiring system and undermine the professional civil service that Americans rely on. 

2) Weaken civil service protections and politicize federal jobs. 

3) Replace qualified public servants with political cronies

4) Make it harder for whistleblowers 

5) Create a Federal work force of "yes men", employees who will be afraid to express an opinion or provide facts that do not directly support the President's agenda

6) Create a Federal work force who has to choose between supporting  a president's unconstitutional agenda or being fired

7) Create a pay to play system of employment rife with fraud and abuse

I have spent my career in research administration at a university and have interacted with staff at the National Institutes of Health for over 20 years. I have found both the scientific and grants management staff to be knowledgeable and professional, acting with integrity and in the best interests of science and the United States.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose any attempt to implement or reinstate the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees. Such a proposal represents a serious and deeply troubling departure from the long-standing, merit-based framework that ensures a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce.

The creation of Schedule F would effectively dismantle protections established under the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was specifically designed to end the patronage-based ‚Äúspoils system‚Äù and promote fair, merit-driven hiring in the federal government. Allowing large numbers of career civil servants‚Äîparticularly those involved in policy or analytical work‚Äîto be reclassified and dismissed without cause would revive the very abuses the Pendleton Act was enacted to prevent.

This policy also runs counter to statutory safeguards enshrined in 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8), which affirm that federal employment decisions must be based on merit and insulated from political coercion. Reclassifying thes

I am deeply concerned about the potential for increased politicization of the federal workforce through the use of Schedule C and Schedule P appointments. While I understand that elected officials need a team aligned with their policy goals, it is essential that this not come at the expense of a professional, nonpartisan civil service.

Of particular concern to me is the potential for medical and health-related positions to be subject to political influence. These positions should remain grounded in scientific integrity, public health needs, and the well-being of the American people ‚Äî not swayed by political agendas or corporate interests. If large corporate donors, for example, push for certain policies or approvals, the federal government must have the strength and independence to withstand such pressures and make decisions based on evidence, not political or financial influence.

The same concern extends to critical regulatory

   Text sample: I strongly believe that the proposed reclassification of career civil service employees, particularly those at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) involved in the meticulous development of funding opportunity announcements and the rigorous peer review process for grant applications, would be profoundly detrimental. This reclassification, under the guise of 'Schedule Policy/Career' (formerly Schedule F), would irrevocably politicize the NIH, undermine the foundational principles of scientific integrity, and catastrophically erode public trust in federally-funded scientific endeavors.

Specifically, this policy would:

Introduce unprecedented political interference into the scientific grantmaking process: The NIH's current system, lauded globally, relies on a merit-based peer review process, insulated from political whims. Career civil servants, acting as scientific stewards, ensure that funding decisions are based on objective scientific merit, not political alignment. Reclassifying

   Text sample: I write in opposition to the proposed rule establishing Schedule Policy/Career positions within the federal workforce, particularly the inclusion of employees involved in federal grantmaking. The proposed regulation risks undermining both the scientific integrity of federal research agencies and the constitutional principle of separation of powers.

The rule proposes reclassifying career federal employees in ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù roles as at-will, removing their longstanding protections under Chapter 75 and Chapter 43 of Title 5. Among those targeted are employees who ‚Äúparticipate substantively in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients.‚Äù This language would sweep in a wide array of federal scientists and grant managers whose work should be guided by merit, peer review, and statutory mandate, not political expediency.

I just want whoever is reading these comments to know that the discussion about how hard it is to fire poor performers is entirely correct. One of the things you realize when you become a Federal employee is that some employees have "retired in place." They are continuing to collect their full salary but aren't doing much to advance the mission and aren't putting in any noticeable effort. In some cases they just don't work at all. Something that was great about telework was these employees just stayed at home and didn't do anything. Now that everyone has to come into the office full-time you have to work with them directly. Except they aren't doing anything more than the bare minimum, and often enough not even that.

While this rule change is framed as strengthening democracy and promoting a nonpartisan civil service, based on my experience as a federal employee, it in fact would do the opposite. By making it easier for political appointees to terminate the appointments of civil servants, this rule change makes it more likely that civil servants will make decisions based on political considerations rather than making decision

This farce of proposed rule is being put forward by an administration that would never countenance any constraint on its own power. Indeed, this rule is being mislabeled as "improving performance" when the head of the agency has made it his personal mission to disable the government and traumatize government workers who put time, effort, and care into doing what they do, often at the expense of more lucrative career options. Russell Vought and Donald Trump are seeking to reclassify workers because their flagrant flouting of worker protections has been occasionally rebuffed by the judiciary and for no other reason. This rule will not support or sustain the institutional memory needed to keep departments functioning between administrations, and that is the true purpose of the rule. They want to destroy institutions and concentrate power under the executive in toto, which has been repeatedly shown to be unconstitutional when challenged

   Text sample: The historical analysis is misleading. From your own account, shortly after the civil service was created, Congress protected them from being fired without cause, and required the "cause" to be in writing. That is a low bar. You are suggesting that presidential appointees can fire a policy employee (why are you picking on policy employees?) without cause. Cause is reason, so without reason. That's not okay. They need cause to show there was actually a problem and it's not just a termination based on personal bias... and it needs to be in writing because otherwise it doesn't exist. No court will uphold a termination with no evidence and nothing in writing.

   Text sample: I write this from the perspective of a current federal employee. I believe that the implementation of this rule would be disastrous for the future of civil service in our country, and the continued functioning and prosperity of the United States. If indeed the intent of this rule is to cripple the world's longest standing democratic government and erode public trust in this great nation, then it must be scrapped immediately and not considered seriously viable by anyone with this country's best interests at heart.

America is far from perfect, but for the most part, we've been stable, prosperous, and constantly on the forefront of innovation for the past 250 years. There is no other modern day country that can make that same claim. At least part of that can be attributed to the work of generations of federal employees that were hired on merit for the last 150 years, thanks to the overwhelmingly bipartisan Pendleton Act. Especially in this time of heightened political polarization, we n

In terms of the civil service and the current administration's viewpoints, here are the reasons an impartial civil service workforce are in the best interest of the public:

1. Efficiency and Competence
Civil servants are selected and promoted based on qualifications and performance, not political loyalty.
This ensures that public services are delivered by people with the skills and experience needed to do the job well.

2. Stability and Continuity
Unlike political appointees who may change with each administration, career civil servants provide institutional memory and continuity.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule outlined in Docket ID: OPM‚Äì2025‚Äì0004, which seeks to increase career employee accountability by reclassifying certain positions as at-will and exempt from adverse action procedures or appeals. While accountability is essential, the approach taken in this proposal poses serious risks to the rights and job security of federal employees, ultimately undermining the integrity of our workforce and the services it provides.

1. Job Security: By moving positions into an at-will classification, employees could be terminated without the protections afforded by due process. This shift threatens job security and creates an environment where employees are vulnerable to arbitrary dismissal based on political motivations rather than legitimate performance concerns.

2. Violation of Federal Employee Rights: The adoption of these changes violates federal employees‚Äô rights to time

I am writing to oppose the rule that OPM is proposing to create a new Schedule Policy/Career within the federal workforce. This rule is unnecessary. For one, there are already existing protocols to remove federal employees for poor performance and corruption, which are serving their purpose, so there is no need to replace them. The existing protocols have been thoughtfully developed with important, built-in safeguards to ensure that employees are fired for cause and not for political motivations. 

Second, the new Schedule Policy/Career would politicize the civil service, since it would allow employees in this category to be fired "for injecting partisanship into the performance of their official duties". There is no way to fairly judge this, which is a key reason why this rule should not be adopted. The current system provides federal employees with the necessary protections to ensure they can preform their duties witho

I am a current Federal employee, submitting these comments in my personal capacity.
In my Federal career, I have worked for the Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Interior. At each of these agencies,
I have had central roles in implementing signature policies and programs of the four Administrations
under which I have served. I draw from these experiences in commenting that OPM‚Äôs proposal to reassign
certain career employees to excepted service makes no sense (the proposed Sec. 213.3501).
My experiences in government prove that the Policy/Career schedule is unnecessary. Career employees
like myself regularly implement the Administration‚Äôs agenda and have done so without needing to be

   Text sample: I am a professional scientist who has served on grant evaluation panels at the National Science Foundation, and many of my close colleagues have served on grant evaluation panels at the National Institutes of Health. I am alarmed by the proposal in OPM-2025-0004 to replace current Directors and Division Directors of the NIH (who are non-partisan civil servants) with partisan, political appointees. There are three main reasons I am against this change. (1) It will erode public trust in science if scientific funding is viewed as being driven by political motives. (2) Political appointees clearly do not have the required, high level of expertise in scientific and health matters. (3) Basic science is a long game over many years. In contrast, political appointments are short. Tacking a major goal (like sequencing the human genome) takes focused effort and support over many years. If funding is granted in one term and pulled back the next, the previous work and taxpayer investment is lost. I

I am a natural-born US citizen and Ivy league-educated scientist who moved overseas three years ago, to Austria. In addition to enjoying considerably more academic and personal freedom than I would currently have in the US, the primary reason that I will not even consider employment in the US in the foreseeable future is that US funding is unreliable, and it will only get more unreliable in the hands of appointees whose employment depends on their loyalty to a president, rather than knowledge, expertise, and performance.

This change would:

To Whom It May Concern:



I write to respectfully oppose the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs proposed rule that would reintroduce a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù classification, allowing career federal employees in ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù positions to be removed without the procedural protections currently afforded under Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5.

Civil servants are already required to obey and implement lawful orders of elected leadership, which can take appropriate corrective actions when compliance is lacking.

   Text sample: Our nation's political landscape can be viewed as a dynamic equilibrium, constantly adjusting to shifts in societal preferences and policy priorities. Like a business cycle, it experiences periods of expansion and contraction, with policy choices reflecting the prevailing ideological currents. Within this fluctuating environment, the federal workforce serves as a critical stabilizing force, akin to a nation's human capital infrastructure.
Maintaining the impartiality and continuity of this workforce is essential for economic efficiency and governance reliability. Laws enacted during different political administrations represent investments in public goods and services, and their effective implementation hinges on a consistent and experienced bureaucracy. Disrupting this institutional knowledge through politically motivated purges would lead to significant transaction costs, including increased turnover rates, reduced productivity, and a decline in overall governmental capacity.

   Text sample: As an American citizen I find this proposed rule to be patently offensive, blatantly corrupt, and intentionally designed to subvert the Constitution and the people who serve the public through civil service.  The only purpose of this proposed rule is to dismantle checks and balances against the President's unbridled pursuit of power and to push an agenda that robs power from the public, whom the President is supposed to serve.

If this rule is implemented, there will be no improvement in performance, no improvement to accountability, and a distinct lack of responsiveness in the civil service. In fact, every aspect of the Federal workforce will suffer, and thus will attract only those who grovel the lowest at the President's feet or those who ruthlessly climb over the backs of others in pursuit of whatever power fantasy the President dangles in front of them.  Gone will be the dedicated, patriotic, proud, loyal (to the US Constitution), and hard working people that made this once great

   Text sample: I am an epidemiologist with experience applying for research funding at NIH and other public agencies as well as private foundations. I find the following section of the proposed rule to be quite worrisome:

"Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions."

The plain meaning is that grantmaking responsibilities should effectuate the policy of the administration, justifying the replacement of civil servant experts with political appointees. Science and research succeed in a context of rigorous competition and transparent decisions. Current NIH rules enable grantmaking to proceed based on scientific peer revi

Public Comment on Proposed Regulation 2025-06904

I strongly oppose the reclassification of NIH leadership positions as political appointments under Schedule F. This change would cause demonstrable harm to American health and scientific progress.

Legal and Public Health Concerns:
The proposed rule violates the principle that federal grant decisions should be based on scientific merit, not political allegiance. By subjecting NIH Institute Directors and Division Directors to political appointment, this regulation will:

- Compromise patient outcomes by prioritizing political loyalty over scientific expertise in research leadership

- Waste taxpayer resources through constant leadership turnover that disrupts multi-year research initiatives

- Undermine public safety by politicizing decisions about which diseases and treatments receive federal research funding

- Damage American competitiveness as other nations maintain merit-based scientific leade

   Text sample: It is well known that people perform better in their jobs when their knowledge and expertise are acknowledged, when their progress towards goals is measured through established performance metrics, and when they are trusted and respected.  A system where only loyalty is rewarded and where all employees serve 'at will' is much worse for employees and the country. This is not my opinion but the basis for the Pendleton Act, which remains the law of the land.

Please note OPM‚Äôs description of its work on its website: ‚ÄúA strong, merit-based civil service is critical to a functioning democracy. It ensures that our government ‚Äúof the people, by the people, for the people‚Äù continues to serve the American public without interruption, even though our leaders change over time. It also safeguards the public interest in a federal workforce that looks like America and that benefits from the talents, ideas, and skills of people from all our nation‚Äôs communities.‚Äù

Comment on Proposed Rule: Improving Performance, Accountability

This comment addresses the proposed rule to reestablish an excepted service schedule for
positions of a policy-determining, policy-making, policy-advocating, or confidential
character‚Äîpreviously known as Schedule F, now known as Schedule Policy/Career.
This comment is being submitted anonymously due to my current position in the federal

   Text sample: I am submitting these comments in opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed regulation ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career.‚Äù  The proposed rule undermines more than 140 years of civil service reform following the spoils system. It opens the door to politically motivated firings and tramples on employees‚Äô constitutional and statutory rights.  Moreover, the proposed regulation to dismantle civil service protections destabilizes the career workforce, politicizes the day- to- day work of government, and erodes the very idea of a professional, independent civil service.  Specific concerns are presented below.
 
‚Ä¢ Performance: This proposal gives lip service to performance management, but rather than providing thoughtful reform, it weaponizes the classification of ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù roles to make it easier to purge career staff. It‚Äôs the latest attempt from this Administration to replace professionalism with ideological alignment.

   Text sample: I think it is deeply problematic to make it easier to fire federal employees. Expertise is built over time, but political winds can shift quickly. Our federal workforce is effective because of the certainty that they can continue their work on behalf of the American people, despite changes in administration. Further, Federal workers have accepted lower pay than they could earn in the private sector because of the certainty that they will be able to keep their job in the Federal government as long as they continue to perform their duties. Removing these protections will make it harder for the federal government to hire the most qualified individuals for the job. Finally, administrations can demand workers carry out duties that are on conflict with the law. Workers should be able to plainly refuse to carry out such orders, but this law could result in retaliation or removal of the employee for upholding the law. Federal worker protections have ben hard won over time and are important for

   Text sample: I am commenting to express my strong opposition to the implementation of the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees. The proposal would significantly weaken the merit-based foundation of the civil service system, which has upheld a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for more than a hundred years.

The Office of Personnel Management is statutorily charged under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101 et seq. with protecting and promoting merit system principles. Schedule F runs directly counter to this mission. By reclassifying career civil servants‚Äîparticularly those engaged in policy-making, analysis, or related functions‚Äîas excepted service employees without the usual civil service protections, Schedule F would enable hiring and firing based on political considerations rather than qualifications and performance. This shift would undermine the principle that federal employment decisions must be based on merit, as enshrined in 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8).

Moreover, Schedule F threatens to erode

employees. This reclassification will move civil service employees from merit-based professional
positions to this ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù excepted service category.

As a prior Federal Employe Employee, I agree with the reasoning and legal support provided in this proposal. 

During my ~30 years of service, I found that organizations tended to follow their own direction when the leaders did not agree with elected officials and there was little to no accountability when they followed their own direction. Blatant disregard of policy direction set by the President/Congress has to change and this proposal is a well reasoned and workable solution to resolve those issues. 

I also believe that many lobbying organizations (like NARFE) will attempt to rally their base to oppose it because it directly limits NARFE power to control USA policy outside the direction provided by our elected officials. As stated, this policy change applies to a very small but highly influential number of Federal Employees who are now being protected by regulations EVEN WHEN THEY ARE ACTING IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO OUR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC PROCESSES.

Scientists spend years gaining specialized knowledge in biology, medicine, and research methodology.

Politicians, while often skilled in leadership and public policy, typically lack the technical expertise required to guide complex medical research responsibly.

2. Objectivity and Integrity:
Scientific research is rooted in objectivity‚Äîdriven by data, not ideology. Politicians, by nature of their roles, often operate within the constraints of public opinion, political agendas, or election cycles. Allowing political interests to override scientific judgment risks biasing research outcomes, delaying progress, and undermining public trust in health guidance.

As a citizen who values good governance and stable institutions, I‚Äôm deeply concerned about the potential damage Schedule F poses to the federal workforce. This policy would give political appointees sweeping power to reclassify and remove career civil servants‚Äînot for misconduct or poor performance, but for ideological reasons.

The civil service exists to provide continuity and nonpartisan expertise across administrations, regardless of political shifts. Undermining that system risks turning dedicated public service into a revolving door of loyalty tests. It invites instability, discourages skilled professionals from serving, and ultimately weakens the federal government‚Äôs ability to function in the public interest.

   Text sample: The proposed rule would significantly erode the principles of merit-based hiring, due process protections, and the non-partisan nature of the federal civil service. By introducing an at-will employment structure for policy-influencing positions, this measure dismantles the very safeguards that ensure government employees serve the public interest rather than political agendas.

Federal employees are protected under a structured system that allows for fair accountability processes, ensuring that removal decisions are based on legitimate concerns rather than political bias or retaliation. Eliminating these protections would make civil servants vulnerable to abrupt termination, chilling their ability to provide honest, expert-driven policy advice. This undermines the stability of government institutions by making career positions subject to shifts in political power, rather than grounded in expertise and continuity.

I write to express strong opposition to the Proposed Rule for the following reasons.

1.	I worked as a Health Psychologist in the VA Health Care System for 25 years and I understand the critical need to maintain a federal workforce that is highly skilled, experienced, and apolitical. Like many professionals I encountered in my federal career, I opted to work as a civil servant out of a deep respect for my country, for democracy, and to honor all those who served our country.

   Text sample: This is an absolutely terrible idea that will make government less efficient, reduce the trust the populace has in the government, and add politics into things that ideally should remain as politically neutral as possible. This rule would effectively put in place a system where non-partisan career civil servants, those with the expertise and drive to perform the vital functions of the government and its agencies, would be routinely removed and replaced with ideologues without the correct expertise to perform their jobs every time the current whims of whatever administration is in power changes. Anyone who claims to value the importance of a meritocratic system of hiring, whether that is in the public or private sphere, should recognize that such a system would not hire the best people for the job, but instead would emplace only sycophants who can parrot a party line. That should similarly frighten people on any side of the political spectrum as we, the public, stand to be harmed by ins

The Office of Personnel Management's revision of Schedule F‚Äî the so-called "Schedule Policy/Career‚Äù ‚Äîis a bad idea that will bring chaos and incompetency to our federal government‚Äôs most critical functions.  

The current Schedule F already allows federal employees to be fired for misconduct or underperformance, but it wisely incorporates an a appeal process that protects them from wanton removal as the winds of politics shift.

The federal statistical system plays an essential role in improving the lives of all Americans as well as informing critical policy decisions with evidence that is timely, relevant, and accurate. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule.

I want a career civil service that acts in the public interest, doing what is legal. The heads of agencies are partisans, who are Senate-confirmed. The last thing the country needs are entire agencies full of partisans. Career jobs require training, expertise and experience. It helps to have agencies staffed primarily with those with institutional knowledge who can and have worked with administrations of both parties.

   Text sample: The entire point of a protected civil service is to stop the politicization of the day-to-day workforce and to end the "spoils system" that would routinely overturn most of the federal government with each change in administration.  Returning to that method is ripe for corruption as the civil service becomes a hotbed of political appointees beholden only the the one who hired them and not We The People.  When applied to the scientific branches, we will end up with a completely political system that will not only affect the workers (as they are routinely fired for newer, more politically "friendly" employees) but also the entirety of the funding process as political employees will inject politics into the grant-making process.

Even ignoring the fact the civil service will end up as a quagmire of political hacks, there is the idea the making massive changes with each administration will mean a loss of institutional memory and best practices.

   Text sample: I am writing as a scientist and as a citizen to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule. 

Expanding the number of political appointees within the civil service threatens the integrity and effectiveness of our government. A merit-based, nonpartisan civil service has long been a cornerstone of the United States. This has ensured that decisions are made based on evidence, expertise, and the public interest. 

This would turn over and politicize key positions at by making them subject to presidential appointment. At the NIH, the potential consequence of this rule is the increased risk of politicizing critical areas such as science funding. Replacing experienced, nonpartisan civil servants with political appointees could undermine the objectivity and continuity essential to research institutions. This impact on scientific progress could affect the heath of all Americans and our innovation-fueled economy.

   Text sample: The United States has long been the envy of the world in its leadership in scientific and biomedical research, and has reaped massive economic benefits from the discoveries and skilled workforce created by this federal investment. At the heart of this has been the infrastructure to evaluate grants submitted to granting agencies, including the program officers that administer these grants and oversee study sections of professional experts to review these grants. Scientific research progress takes consistent effort over timelines that do not align with political changes, and disruptions to funding infrastructure and ongoing projects are worse than not having the funds at all, as prematurely terminated research will often be fully wasted funds as half-finished projects often cannot be stored and reanimated later, and may not have yet reached the stage to yield any insights into the scientific or medical questions they are designed to address.

   Text sample: The idea of having at-will political appointees in leadership positions at agencies like NIH is a terrible idea. 
These positions must remain non-political, filled by career scientists selected based on merit according to established procedures and with all protections and options for appeal. 
Having at-will political appointees in such positions will further undermine the U.S. leading position and reputation across the globe, and hinder groundbreaking innovations and developments to improve health and well-being of the US population. 
Credibility is already taking a hit with the appointment of RFK Jr as HHS secretary and the initiation of a study to 'find the link between vaccines and autism' which has already been debunked many times over. 
Putting political at-will appointees in these positions is a FAR greater risk to the independence, functioning, and success of health-related research and development than a very small number of individuals who may underperform or exhibit biases.

I am adamantly opposed to the Proposed Rule creating the "Schedule Policy/Career" (P/C) classification, stripping critical civil service protections from thousands of federal employees.

My sister lives in Asheville, NC, and has seen firsthand how FEMA civil servants provide critical support following devastating natural disasters. My son was a BLM firefighter, putting his life on the line to protect communities. What will happen to Western homeowners who rely on experienced fire managers when they are laid off for no reason? When agencies like the Social Security Adminstration get gutted of experienced civil servants, where's the support going to be for ordinary people who retire and need help to access

The notion that decisions about the funding of scientific progress is "policymaking" is incredibly misguided. NIH grant reviewers and program officers judge grants based on the soundness of their preliminary results, past data, and track record- these judgements require high levels of domain expertise and could not be made by political appointees.

My civil service work provided research and analysis to support Army decision making about materiel design, policy, doctrine, personnel selection, or training effectiveness.  My division of analysts and I possessed advanced knowledge and expertise in human performance methodology and measurement, statistics, modeling and simulation, and cost effectiveness.  We were free to customize and conduct studies to fit the problem, select appropriate alternatives for study, and provide data-driven results.  We prided ourselves on objective interpretation.

I have interacted with many civil servants in the many different agencies within the federal government including but not exclusive to NASA, NIH, NSF, USDA, and the Social Security Administration.

   Text sample: The Good Science Project is a think tank focused on improving federal science funding and policy. We write to object to one aspect of the proposed rule, namely the following paragraph: "Substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant recipients. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions."  

In some cases across the federal government (e.g., DOJ‚Äôs line of grants to support local policing programs or ACF's grants to support economic wellbeing), it does make sense to see grantmaking as a way of directly affecting policy.

In the case of scientific grantmaking, however, there should almost never (if ever) be any policymaking directly at issue. Scientific grantmaker

The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 established that hiring people to work in the United States federal government would be based on merit, thus replacing a corrupt patronage system.

performance goals, not based on campaign contributions, votes delivered, or political considerations.

As a scientist that interfaces with federal agencies that support science funding priorities, this rule would have a disastrous effect on our nation's ability to remain competitive in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Currently, civil employees in the relevant government agencies in this space are able to remain independent, allowing for years of consistency for researchers and funding bodies. Scientific discoveries take adequate time to move from idea to application, and the disruption of new Presidential administrations every 4-8 years could result in entire productive fields to lose support due to political motivations.

In my field, only the brightest high character scientists take positions in federal government agencies, and these individuals are able to become bedrocks of American's scientific enterprise. To think that these individuals could be removed from there positions according to whatever polit

   Text sample: This regulation would revive the first Trump Administration‚Äôs ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù initiative under a new name: ‚ÄúSchedule
Policy / Career.‚Äù Most career civil servants are in what‚Äôs known as the competitive or the excepted services and
earn due process protections after they complete their probationary or trial periods of employment. That means
that they can be fired for cause‚Äîfor example, poor performance‚Äîbut not for other, political reasons. But this new
excepted service schedule, Schedule Policy/Career, lacks such protections and once ‚Äúpolicy influencing‚Äù positions
are moved into that schedule, the career employees in those positions would be fireable ‚Äúat will.‚Äù This would
impact tens or even hundreds of thousands of federal workers in ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù roles and give the
Administration the ability to fire them based on political allegiance rather than merit.

   Text sample: While improving performance, accountability and responsiveness in the Civil Service should always be, worthy objectives, the proposed rule (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004) in fact undermines those stated objectives. I'm writing in opposition to the Office of Personnel Management's proposed rule. My experiences with federal employees have been stellar, and demonstrate the importance of providing employees the protections and support, along with the critical hiring procedures, that allow them the expertise and experience to provide quality service.  Earlier this year I had to renew my passport on an expedited basis.  The entire process from check-in through pick-up of the new passport was well organized, informative and efficient. Every worker from security through customer support was courteous, knowledgeable and helpful.  Given the high volume of people they deal with every session, the level of service could not have been higher.  We want to retain these valuable public servants, who take t

   Text sample: I strongly oppose this proposed regulation, which would to strip vast swaths of the federal workforce of procedural job protections and make them Ô¨Åreable at will.  Federal employees have chosen to go into federal service, frequently for lower pay than in the private sector, to serve the American public and protect human health, the environment, protect public safety, protect our wild lands, make our food and drugs safe, and administer our benefits programs among other work.  Civil service projections ensure federal employees are hired and fired based on merit rather than political affiliation, allowing them to perform their duties without fear of political retaliation.  Without these protections, at the very least, the pool of the next generation of the federal workforce will diminish.  Civil service is a calling, and without those protections it just becomes another job.  The United States' position as a leader in scientific research will be lost.

Imagine workers on a car assembly line at Ford Motor Company being replaced with political appointees on January 21. That is not how private business works. Neither does government.

   Text sample: I highly oppose the elimination of the merit-based civil service protections by creating an excepted service schedule P/C, formerly Schedule F.  Employees should not be fired at will for their party affiliation.  There should be no knowledge of an employee's political affiliation by his employer. This is a personal choice and right as a citizen and not a job requirement. This is control and manipulation of the government workers by whichever political administration is in the White House.  The government employee works for the people of the United States of American and not for a particular political party.

It is very carefully thought out and there are numerous safeguards in place to ensure the best people - based on merit - are placed in these needed positions. 

Most career civil service personnel have served under multiple administrations.  They are the people who keep the ship sailing for the American taxpayers during times of transition and change.  They ensure continuity and objectivity. They are why the authoritative data provided by the federal government is considered trustworthy and reliable by the private sector and other governments.

   Text sample: I am a former career Federal employee.  I worked for the Federal government for almost 30 years in four Federal agencies.  I worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations.  Without exception, political leaders of each newly elected Administration, both Democratic or Republican were initially skeptical and mistrustful of career staff.  However, they soon learned that career staff, rather than being obstacles to new policies and initiatives, were highly skilled and had a wealth of experience they could rely on. While career staff might on occasion voice concerns about potential  problems that could arise, this was not political resistance or attempts to sabotage new initiatives. Rather, as political leaders realized, career staff‚Äôs freedom to speak without fear of retribution was important information that they needed to make good decisions. In my many years of Federal service I never saw a colleague refuse to implement a new policy or assignment. We were always aware that

   Text sample: The proposed rule of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is a harmful sinister plot to create a civil service workforce based on cronyism and composed of sycophants. Removal of civil servants due to poor performance and misconduct is an excuse. It is a cunning excuse because no tax payer and a professional like me will tolerate a subpar and incompetent civil servant or somebody engaged in misconduct unless he/she works for the current President's cabinet! Why are these supervisors not coming forward to document their difficulties in removing employees for poor performance and misconduct? OPM has bunch of tools to do just that. May be these supervisors are themselves incompetent and politically affiliated partisan individuals. They do not want to be bothered or delayed by "due process" that an individual must get.

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. The proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù would call into question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for our economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and many other statistics.

Most administrations struggle to fill 3,000-4,000 political appointee positions, so an exponential increase of this type of position could lead to many open positions and reduced effectiveness of many agencies.

There is an explicit tension in the civil service: Congress creates agencies and directs
them to do certain things. The Executive Branch implements what Congress creates.
When there is disagreement between what an agency is generally understood to be
responsible for (i.e. protecting the environment) and what the President is or is not
interested in (i.e., protecting the environment), then the civil service is caught in the
middle. Rational people, understanding that the law takes precedence over Presidential
desires, work to protect the mission of the agency as directed by Congress. Hence,

The Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability
and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù which seeks to resurrect elements of the defunct
Schedule F, is both legally dubious and substantively flawed. Schedule F was originally
established through Executive Order 13957 in 2020 and quickly rescinded due to widespread
concern that it circumvented merit system principles and undermined the apolitical nature of the
civil service. Attempting to reintroduce this framework through regulatory rulemaking violates
the statutory protections enshrined in Title 5 of the U.S. Code, which guarantees due process,
competitive hiring, and protection against politically motivated employment decisions.
Furthermore, the proposal lacks evidentiary support demonstrating that such drastic changes are
necessary to improve performance or accountability, and it fails to address how

   Text sample: This rule change is NOT needed. It's funny how this is the ONLY administration to supposedly need this rule change. Because they say they are not be able to fire someone for "poor performance or misconduct". The reason is that this administration defines "misconduct" as "not obeying the directives of this administration because they are illegal". In other words, not that the employee's conduct was improper according to the normal rules of employment, but that the rules of conduct are changing under this administration. If there were actual misconduct according to normal, or actual poor performance, that would be easily documented and the employee can be removed. 
This president has made a career of "you're fired". Why is it so incompeted that his administration cannot use the rules that are in place for removing bad employees? The answer is simple - their definition of "bad" is "not a sycophant, not a loyalist, not willing to just obey orders".

   Text sample: I am concerned about the proposed ruling and, most importantly, this portion:

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing a rule to increase career employee accountability. Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct. The proposed rule lets policy-influencing positions be moved into Schedule Policy/Career. These positions will remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis. Yet they will be at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals. This will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.

First, I would like to see documented evidence of "great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct." Second, I understand that some federal scientific employees, like those who work for the NSF, will be under this move. NSF and other scie

Replacing career civil servants with partisan loyalists that can be fired at will politicizes public service and reduces organizational performance. This is particularly true for science agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes for Health (NIH), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); they cannot meet their statutorily mandated scientific missions if politics, rather than scientific expertise, drive decision-making. Federally supported science has been so successful because agency staff are typically expert scientists beholden to ensuring that the agencies deliver world-class science based on the highest standards of scientific integrity.

As a social worker who previously worked with Social Security (SSA) claimants navigating the application and appeals process, I'm deeply concerned by the OPM's proposal to change administrative law judges (ALJs) into at-will employees. Administrative law judges often need to make very complicated and nuanced decisions for SSA claimants and it's deeply concerning that they could be fired without cause, especially considering the Trump administration's repeated false claims that many SSA claimants are dead or defrauding the government. I have seen the opposite in my work. It is extremely difficult for claimants to get on Social Security and ALJ hearings are one of the only times that claimants are actually able to meet with the a government official who is making a determination about their case.

Given what we've seen recently with chaotic firings in multiple government departments recently, it's clear that further job protections should not be removed. From my point of view as a citizen, increasing the ease of firings just means more interruptions of services, and a less effective government.  

In addition, this policy is very short-sighted: the current executive should consider that any future President/agency head would be given the same power. Scientific agencies in particular would be at risk. Many government agency heads do not have scientific expertise, and could be persuaded to fire employees whose actions are based on solid scientific evidence, simply because it fulfills a political wish. I am troubled by the phrase, "many career federal employees use their positions to advance their personal political or policy preferences instead of implementing the elected President's agenda."

The proposed changes are based on the assumption that there is a problem. I am not convinced the suggested problem exists. In fact the extensive history presented indicates that career civil servants were eventually provided with some reasonable degree of job protection that wasn‚Äôt initially there for their predecessors, suggesting that dismissals in the past were often arbitrary and destructive to the expertise of government agencies. But let us consider the possibility that to some degree the suggested problem exists. Then the solution shouldn‚Äôt be to remove all protections.

The politicization of science destroys knowledge, innovation, careers, and lives. This is the exact opposite of making America greater or healthier. 

To support my claim about the Trump administration politicizing science, I'm referring to the administration's involvement in terminating thousands of already-funded National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) grants. The NIH and NSF claim that they terminated these awards because the grants were unscientific. That's a lie, though.

Memorandum
To: Federal Regulations Board
From: Daniel Ortiz
Date: May 21, 2025
Subject: Opposition to Proposed OPM Rule Allowing At-Will Conversion of Career Positions
Purpose
This memorandum provides a formal argument against the Office of Personnel
Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed rule to reclassify certain career federal positions into
Schedule Policy/Career at-will appointments. While the intent to enhance accountability is
understandable, this rule undermines the nonpartisan merit system, removes critical
employee protections, and risks politicizing the civil service.
Background
OPM‚Äôs proposed rule aims to move policy-i

The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 established that hiring people to work in the United States federal government would be based on merit, thus replacing a corrupt patronage system.  This Act established a system based on merit, not on political connections.

Please keep the merit-based system established by the Pendleton Act!

In Chicago and in Boston, a patronage system has led to corrupt public officials and to incompetence and disregard of the public good.  It is a system based on patronage, not fairness.  This would be directly contradictory to President Trump's stated goal of efficiency in government.

   Text sample: As the proud son of two professional federal civil servants, I am deeply concerned about the current state of our national civil service. I recall many kitchen-table discussions about being under-resourced and constantly having to triage "who‚Äôs scamming the American people more." However, the scam artists were never the civil servants who brought their work home with them (and, in my case, gave me a first-class education in tax law). Instead, the real issue lay with the IRS‚Äôs inability to effectively go after every bad actor‚Äîleading to a forced focus on those who could pay but not fully defend themselves.

My parents NEVER discussed party affiliation, presidential loyalty, or personal beliefs at home. In fact, I‚Äôm fairly certain we were a zero-sum household‚Äîone (D), one (R). That is precisely my point: My parents were consummate professionals, and their non-partisan approach to their careers spilled into our personal lives.

This proposal, which seeks to reintroduce an excepted service schedule‚Äînow called ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù‚Äîwould fundamentally undermine the merit-based foundations of the federal civil service by stripping critical due process protections from career federal employees in so-called "policy-influencing positions." Despite assurances that these positions will remain nonpartisan and filled through standard career hiring processes, the practical effect is to make them at-will positions, reviving the very kind of politicized patronage system that the Pendleton Act of 1883 and subsequent civil service reforms were explicitly designed to eliminate.

   Text sample: Science is fundamentally about uncovering objective facts, independent of political considerations. Facts do not shift with political tides; they remain constant, irrespective of who occupies the White House or holds legislative power. Therefore, categorizing scientists‚Äîwhose role is purely to discover and communicate these objective truths‚Äîas politically influential or aligned is both misleading and harmful.

Scientists provide policymakers and the public with essential, unbiased information. Their data and analyses inform decisions across critical areas such as public health, environmental safety, national security, and technological innovation. Viewing this vital role as politically charged undermines the integrity of scientific inquiry and erodes trust in science itself.

Firing or sidelining scientists simply because their factual findings conflict with prevailing political narratives is not only absurd but dangerous. Doing so denies policymakers and the public access to accurate,

These rule changes will do the opposite of what they claim--they will REDUCE the performance, accountability, and responsiveness in the federal workforce! 

1. By dramatically decreasing the number of civil servants and increasing the number of political appointees, FEWER FEDERAL WORKERS WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, but more federal workers will be held accountable to wealthy, elitist politicians. This is not the "accountability" that Americans voted for!

2. By shifting the balance of the federal workforce away from career civil service and toward temporary political appointments, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE WILL DECLINE. The federal workforce will lose workers with institutional wisdom and skills, only to be replaced by novices. Staffing the federal government with inexperienced people who

Acting under this belief, I *oppose* the proposed regulation.

The proposed regulation couches its argument in the interest of "democratic responsiveness" and claims that it would be a "misperception" of the proposed regulation to think that it clouds the boundary between career/nonpolitical and noncareer/political appointees. This claim is false.

This rule would permit political interference with the grant making and grant awarding steps of the knowledge-mining process. It would politicize jobs that should be entirely independent of political ideology, jobs for which scientific expertise and the capacity to assess evidence should be the main focus --- as it has been traditionally.

The rule would change how grants are awarded. It would put people involved in this process into a politically compromised position, because they would be serving "at the will of the president" and not according to the best evidence, or to the best paths of research identified by experts

I am writing  to oppose a change in the way the federal government interacts with our federal workforce. As a retired teacher who observed several staff reductions in my decades long career and the spouse of retired employee of a major oil company who witnessed six layoffs in his career, I have strong feelings about the modus operendi of employee/ staff relations. In all of these collective experiences dismissed employees were dismissed with cause and respect. 

I am also concerned that the recent style of this administration is not only chasing away our best and brightest but will discourage our upcoming generations from seeking employment in our federal government if  protections are not guaranteed for a respectful work environment.

Let me explain through a real-world lens: how manipulating opioid overdose statistics could hide a public health catastrophe.

1. Replacing Experts with Loyalists = Distorted Data
Schedule Policy/Career allows the president to replace nonpartisan civil servants with political appointees loyal to his agenda. Imagine this playing out at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Career epidemiologists tracking opioid deaths‚Äîthose who ensure data reflects reality, not political narratives‚Äîcould be fired for questioning an administration‚Äôs false claim that ‚Äúthe opioid crisis is over.‚Äù In their place, officials with no public health expertise might be installed. These appointees could redefine how overdose deaths are counted, excluding synthetic opioids like fentanyl or reclassifying them as ‚Äúaccide

Since the passing of The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883, career civil servants have lent their skills and expertise to our government to actually improve its performance, accountability and responsiveness to the American public, which pays their salaries.  Research (for example, Brookings) shows that the reliance on political appointees actually undermines government performance.  

I have a business background and know the chaos and inefficiency that comes from replacing workers and managers, especially those with less knowledge and skill than those currently in the positions (as political appointees would likely be).

   Text sample: I oppose the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs proposed rule titled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù (RIN: 3206-AO80). While the stated intent may be to make the government more responsive to political direction, this rule is much more likely to degrade government performance, efficiency, and the capacity of the federal government to serve the American people.  
I am an expert in public management, a professor at the University of Michigan, the author of dozens of published peer-reviewed articles about the management of public agencies and programs, and a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.  During the first Trump and Biden administrations, I worked with government experts on parts of the President‚Äôs Management Agenda.

I strongly oppose this proposed rule, which would replace competence and experience with patronage.  The current system is well balanced between non-career positions, filled by presidential appointments and that change with Administrations, and career public servants.  The former set policies and the latter offer knowledge, experience, and a commitment to the Constitution and American people that facilitates the implementation of the President‚Äôs policies.  Replacing professionals with party hacks and lackeys, with a disruptive transition every four or eight years, will undermine the effectiveness of government functions from defense to Social Security.

Comment addressing Docket No. OPM-2025-0004 :
https://www.regulations.gov/document/OPM-2025-0004-0001
The rule proposed by the Office of Personnel Management, identified by Docket No.
OPM-2025-0004, aims to create an additional category for federal employees referred to as
‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù (‚ÄúRegulations.gov,‚Äù 2025). This proposal would remove federal
employees from their positions without mandating procedures and authorize the fast removal of
those employees. I oppose the Office of Personnel Management's proposal for the removal of
employees who engage in misconduct, and I believe it would undermine our current political
system by silencing voices that oppose the presidential candidates. As a person who believes in
nonpartisan civil service, those civil servants must provide an impartial role in maintaining
partisan merit and serve to uphold the Constitution. I am concerned that this order would

This regulation would reclassify jobs that once fell under civil service protection and where the jobs could be filled on the basis of expertise and experience to policymaker positions. Those in these poisitions could be fired at will if they do not align with current Administration policy. These new policymaker positions would include those with substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, and recommending or selecting grant recipients. In regard to NIH it appears that all Institute and Center Directors would become political appointees. This will remove scientific decision making on public health needs for research and the funding

My name is Maria Barry, and I am a proud Washingtonian and daughter of a U.S. Air Force veteran who went on to serve this country for 44 years as a federal employee at the National Weather Service, NOAA. Public service is in my blood‚Äîand so is the deep belief that our government must work for the people.

This proposed rule (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, RIN: 3206-AO80), which gives the President unilateral power to reclassify civil servants as ‚Äúpolitical,‚Äù stripping them of job protections, flies in the face of what makes our democracy worth fighting for. It endangers the foundation that my father and so many others dedicated their lives to upholding.

Implementing Schedule F would undermine these principles. It would expose career civil servants to political pressure, destabilize operations, and reduce the government‚Äôs ability to fulfill statutory mandates such as the 21st Century IDEA, the Government Performance and Results Act, and the Rehabilitation Act.

While framed as an administrative reform, Schedule F would undermine the integrity, independence, and effectiveness of the federal workforce. Nowhere would the damage be more profound than in critical fields like water management, where scientific expertise, continuity, and nonpartisan service are essential.

Federal employees across agencies like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Army Corps of Engineers are responsible for safeguarding drinking water, managing infrastructure, responding to droughts and floods, and protecting ecosystems. These missions demand technical excellence, long-term planning, and independence from political pressure.

Isn't policy making reserved for Selected Service (SES) employees? If the employees being covered to schedule F are not granted new policy making authority how can the administration justify their conversions? It is my understanding that at the Social Security Administration entire components, right down to the entry level clerks are being converted to schedule F.  What rationale is the administration using to support this decision? Further, it appears at the Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings Operations, decision writers and legal clerks are being converted to schedule F.

The supposed purpose of this rule is to give presidents more control over federal workers by granting them the power to quickly fire them, without reason or ability to appeal.

These individuals usually serve at the highest levels of an agency, directing the work of that agency to implement the administration‚Äôs policy agenda. In the 140 years since the merit-based civil service was established, every president has found a way to accomplish their agendas without needing the ability to fire civil servants on a whim.

   Text sample: It is crucial for U.S. federal employees, particularly those in career civil service positions, to not be political appointees for several key reasons:
 * Non-partisanship and Neutrality: A core principle of the civil service is to provide consistent, unbiased service to the American public, regardless of which political party is in power. If career employees were political appointees, their jobs could be tied to the shifting political winds of each administration. This would undermine public trust and lead to a perception that government services are being administered for political gain rather than for the common good. The Hatch Act, for instance, specifically aims to maintain a federal workforce free from partisan political influence or coercion.
 * Continuity and Institutional Knowledge: Political appointees typically serve for the duration of an administration, leading to high turnover. Career federal employees, on the other hand, often spend years, even decades, in their roles. T

This memorandum outlines the legal concerns associated with the reinstatement or implementation of "Schedule F," a former federal employment classification created by Executive Order 13957 (October 2020). The proposed classification, which sought to reclassify certain policy-related federal positions as exempt from competitive service protections, raises significant constitutional, statutory, and administrative law issues.

As the agency charged with overseeing the federal civil service system and upholding the merit principles codified in law, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has both a legal and institutional obligation to oppose Schedule F on the grounds set forth below.

   Text sample: I have concerns regarding changes proposed to the employment status of government employees.

First off, I believe at least some of these employees are members of a labor union and their rights under the NRLA and other laws, court decisions and regulations should be protected.

Secondly, the hiring process ensures that no one is unduly discriminated against because of race, creed, physical abilities, religion, or political beliefs. None of these things should be considered when hiring and firing employees.

Lastly I consider the federal workforce to be doing a good job in serving the American people. Anyone I have been in contact with has been helpful, courteous and competent.

Because of this, I think the proposed changes would be detrimental to the functioning of our federal agencies.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed changes regarding the hiring rules for career federal employees. Federal jobs should awarded based on merit, full stop. A person's political opinions or "loyalty" should not be taken into account. A politicized civil service has potentially catastrophic consequences, namely removing any functionality to our government.

Civil servants should not be under further pressure. They are already scrutinized far more than they deserve and are what makes our country function. These people are skilled, educated, and experienced in their roles and to have any of that change depending on who is in office is a slap in the face to not only anyone who has ever been a federal worker, but to our country itself.

I can't help but think of the potential damage that could be done to Americans if ideologies with no fact-based merit can shape federal policy. A government serves its citizens. All of its citizens. I urge the Office of Personnel Management to protect the integrit

   Text sample: I. Purpose

This memorandum outlines the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs legal, policy, and operational objections to the potential reinstatement of Schedule F, a classification created under Executive Order 13957 (October 2020). This classification would reassign certain policy-related positions to the excepted service, eliminating critical civil service protections and enabling removals based on political considerations.
II. Background

Schedule F was intended to apply to federal employees in ‚Äúconfidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating‚Äù roles. The order effectively exempted these employees from competitive service protections, including due process rights and appeal mechanisms. Although the executive order was revoked in January 2021, its potential reinstatement poses ongoing legal and operational risks to the integrity of the federal workforce.

While there are always areas for improvement in any institution, the purpose and intent of scientific research is to expand, explore, and provide benefits to the American people. Scientific research is best performed in an apolitical atmosphere. This policy would add yet another layer of federally appointed Schedule F employees and contradict the proposed smaller, more efficient government outlined by the Administration. Furthermore, scientific discoveries take time, patience, and continued pursuit, often on multi-year timescales. This system would likely increase turnover of government positions with each new administration, which would reduce efficiency, and the likelihood of discovery.

   Text sample: I am writing as an Assistant Professor of Linguistics at Stanford University to express my serious concerns about the proposed rule.

This rule creates a dangerous precedent by potentially classifying scientific positions as "policy-influencing." This classification fundamentally misunderstands the nature of scientific work in government. Scientists do not engage in policymaking - they provide factual information and evidence-based analysis that informs policy decisions.

The scientific method is built on objectivity and empiricism. The data, findings, and conclusions that scientists provide do not and should not change based on which administration occupies the White House. A molecule's structure, a climate measurement, or an epidemiological trend remains consistent and non-partisan. To classify the reporting of such information as "policy-influencing" is not only conceptually incorrect but potentially harmful to the integrity of federal scientific work.

I write to strongly oppose the proposed rule that would reestablish ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù and allow for the reclassification of tens of thousands of federal civil service positions as ‚Äúpolicy-making‚Äù roles, thereby making them subject to political appointment and removal.

This proposal undermines the fundamental principles of a merit-based, nonpartisan civil service and threatens the integrity of federal decision-making processes‚Äîparticularly in the domain of science and public health.

The proposed rule change is so wrong for, at least, the following reasons.  This change would politicize the United States civil service by making up to 50,000 civil service employees ‚Äúat-will‚Äù employees across multiple agencies such as Agriculture, Defense and Treasury, dependent upon the desires or whims of the current administration, no matter who is in power.  At-will employment will require civil service employees to follow Presidential directives or lose their respective jobs.  Also, the anticipated employee turnover will deter qualified persons from applying for at-will civil service employment, thereby reducing the pool of qualified applicants.  Finally, at-will employment will discourage those already employed from speaking the truth and cause the loss of institutional knowledge. 
 Examples of such conduct have been evident in the current administration.

Smart people but with no industry experience or even academic training in the field could be and were supervising teams of 8 or more geoscientists. Management wanted lots of drilling prospects and we happily looked for reasons to supply them. No one I knew  personally  made up data, but salesmanship was at least as important as data.

Despite the anodyne summary ("These positions will remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis") it's abundantly clear from the plain language, even of the summary, that the rulemaking seeks to transform these jobs into political appointments ("Yet they will be at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals"). 

The present civil service merit system was instituted precisely to counteract the pernicious effects of the prior political appointment ("spoils") system. Although, as with all human works, it is imperfect, it has served our country well -- it ain't broke, so to speak. Furthermore, there is no reason to believe the proposed rulemaking will lead to improved outcomes -- so don't fix it, to conclude the aphorism.

Under the current system, civil service jobs are protected to ensure that those holding them are free from outside interference and political pressure. This is how it should be. A bureaucracy cannot function effectively if it changes with the political winds every 4-8 years, or with the whims of the president.  

Further, a functioning democracy requires stability in the various agencies of government and this policy would create instability and chaos.That's because while politics may change, facts do not.

The public has an expectation that the federal service carries  out the law in  a responsible and professional manner according to law. These proposed changes would return the country to the nineteenth century system of patronage. 

In regulation of the federal service the government  should adhere to basic human rights  principles which include (a) performance review by non-political managers, (b) specific criteria for performance reviews and (c) communication that identifies performance issues, a strategy for improvement and a time goal.

In conclusion these proposed

   Text sample: This document is illegal according to laws and regulations. In addition, OPM has NO authority to implement this. If this illegal document is implemented there are legal consequences.

1. Violation of Due Process Rights Under the Fifth Amendment
The rule would strip federal employees in policy-influencing positions of their statutory and constitutional due process protections, including notice, a hearing, and the right to appeal adverse actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The Supreme Court has held that federal employees have a property interest in their employment under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. SeeCleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985). The proposed rule unlawfully deprives employees of these protections without adequate justification.
2. Contravention of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978
The CSRA established a comprehensive framework for federal employee protections, including adverse action procedures under 5 U.S.C.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed regulation introducing the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees under the guise of enhancing accountability in the civil service. Far from benefiting the American people, this proposal threatens the merit-based, nonpartisan civil service system that has sustained a professional federal workforce for over a century.
At its core, Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to dismantle the spoils system and establish a hiring process based on merit. By allowing large numbers of career civil servants‚Äîespecially those involved in policy-making or analysis‚Äîto be reclassified and potentially removed without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated employment decisions. This is in direct conflict with 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal personnel actions be based on merit and free from political influence.
Additionally, the broad and ambiguous criteria for placing e

2.	Not About Performance: This proposal gives lip service to performance management, but rather than providing thoughtful reform, it weaponizes the classification of ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù roles to make it easier to purge career staff. It‚Äôs the latest attempt from this Administration to replace professionalism with ideological alignment.

   Text sample: As a citizen of this country, I strongly oppose this proposed rule.

There is a reason these rules are in place, which is to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty.

Plus, passing this rule could open the door to politicizing the civil service, threatening the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government. This reason being that career cilvil servants are not meant to be political appointees but rather skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public, regardless of who is in office. 

As such, allowing broader reasons for dismissal(ex.subverting Presidential directives) will make it easier for civil servants with opposing political ideology to that of the president to be easily replace with ones who have more politically aligned ideologies. This could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

   Text sample: Our government works on a system of checks and balances. It was not designed to give any one person complete authority, even an elected president. US science has been the envy of the world for its productivity and creativity; it has also been an economic engine that has produced not only countless improvements to the lives of its citizens but also real wealth to those involved in the production and distribution/sale of its translated discoveries. Key to this success has been the independence of decision-makers who decide what to fund based on sound science, not partisan politics. Replacing such a successful system where one person, whether democratically elected or not, can have undue influence based on their individual preference would dramatically undermine the system and do irreparable harm. Congress traditionally has conveyed its priorities in appropriate ways and that should continue. Having people charged with making difficult decisions serve on an "at will" basis would remove th

   Text sample: I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. The proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù would call into question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and other statistics. The federal statistical system plays an essential role in improving the lives of all Americans as well as informing critical policy decisions with evidence that is timely, relevant, and accurate. 

These are some of things which will be called into question if this is allowed to proceed.

   Text sample: I oppose this change to how the civil service runs. As an academic in STEM with many peers working in career civil servant positions, the primary reason my colleagues are willing to take those jobs is the job security. Civil servant positions often have significantly worse pay than comparable positions in industry, but have similar job protections to tenure in academia. Researchers and other technical people who want to help others and make the country better are often willing to take those jobs despite the lower salary because the job protections help them plan financially for their futures. This enables government agencies to hire people with important expertise and skillsets.
While the rule states that reclassified employees will only be fired for poor performance or partisanship, it's unclear what protections will be in place to ensure this is how it will be used. The current policies around firing civil servants provide protections for federal workers to prevent them from being fi

Re: ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,ÀÆ Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004

Dear Office of Personnel Management:

I submit these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management ºs (OPM) Proposed Rule ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,ÀÆ 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule.

I am an independent scientist and researcher with more than 15 years of experience in forestry, environmental science and policy. I have published more than 170 peer-reviewed scientific studies and worked extensively with federal agency scientists and civil servants to ensure that independent and rigorous science informs the actions of federal agencies carrying out their statutory missions. 

The proposed rule undermines more than a century of civil service reform. It

I also am writing as a former program director at the National Science Foundation, one of the agencies that will be adversely affected by this change to policy.

In particular, the development and implementation of Schedule F is intended to undermine the ability of the civil service to do the job it was created to perform, and does not address the problems claimed in the notice in the Federal Register. 

For example, program directors at the NSF would fall under schedule F. Program directors (PDs) manage the research funding programs that have made the United States the global leader in scientific and technological innovation.

Subject: Comment Opposing Proposed Rule to Reclassify Federal Employees as Political
Appointees
I am submitting this comment in my personal capacity.
As a federal employee, I write to express strong opposition to OPM‚Äôs proposed rule (RIN: 3206-
AO80), which seeks to reclassify large numbers of federal employees into a new Schedule,
effectively stripping them of long-standing civil service protections and exposing them to political
firings.
My Background and Personal Experience
I have worked in the federal government for 5 years, currently serving as an Internal Revenue Agent.
I joined public service because of its commitment to neutrality, rule of law, and evidence-based
decision-making. I‚Äôve remained in government‚Äîdespite opportunities in the private sector‚Äî
because I believed in a nonpartisan civil service where I could serv

   Text sample: This comment is being made in opposition of Schedule F, which would reclassify upwards of 50,000 civil servants as political appointees. As a PhD student in environmental engineering at Northwestern University in Illinois, I strongly oppose this on the basis that it provides no guarantees that appointees will be non-partisan, it is likely that the vast majority will be partisan political appointees, and no appointee can behave in a non-partisan manner when those who decide the future of their careers demonstrate strong partisanship. Furthermore, so much of what makes any complex institution run smoothly is continuity of experienced personnel. Under no circumstances do I think we should be seeking to transform these practical and specialized roles into appointees beholden to partisan directionality and high turnover rates. In the professional interactions me and my colleagues have had with federal representatives of the Trump administration so far, we have encountered instances of these

   Text sample: The United States has a historic tradition of civic service that began in the early 1900s, after significant anti-corruption reform. Prior to these reforms, the civic service was used as a spoils system to reward political loyalty, rather than competence or to ensure care for the public. It created a system where loyalty was owed to whoever got you your job and whoever could fire you, rather than to the public interest of the United States. The civil service reforms changed all of that, creating a non-partisan workforce that remained from administration to administration. These civil service employees are rewarded with strong government benefits and job security, all in the name of helping them maintain their neutrality.

It is unsurprising, yet no less striking, that the most corrupt administration in memory (this one!) is seeking to undo those reforms that transformed our society into the one that used to be admired worldwide. Here, the way the administration claims it will "Make Ame

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed Schedule F rule. The proposed rule will damage U.S.'s standing as a leader in science and innovation. As an early career scientist who has been continuously supported by NIH funding since graduating college, I have held immense pride in my identity as an innovator applying taxpayer money to improve the health and well-being of my fellow citizens through research. I have been to several international conferences at which I have had the opportunity to discuss the differences between the U.S. academic research system relative to those abroad, and have always walked away proud of the combination of scientific integrity and rigor that we have been able to achieve here. A large part of this has been the long-standing respect in this country for the sanctity of the unbiased scientific pursuit of evidence, and the ability of researchers with the proper training to discern high- vs low-quality science to drive the direction that this research takes.

Regarding Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, I am deeply concerned about the future of the civil service should this rule be instated. While the proposed rule states that the positions in question will remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis, critically, it removes protections ensuring these positions will be retained on a nonpartisan basis. The very nature of at-will positions, which the proposed rule aims to instate, provides that the employer, in this case the government, can end the employment at any time for any reason, including those of a partisan nature. We need not speculate whether this is the intent of the proposed rule to find reason to object to it; even a potential threat that this rule may polarize and politicize the civil service should be enough to give us pause. And I‚Äôm not alone in believing this. A 2024 Partnership for Public Service survey found that 87% of Americans surveyed believe that having a nonpartisan civil service is

For decades, federal scientists of varying personal political, religious, social and philosophical leanings have worked together as dedicated civil servants to improve the quality of life for individuals in the USA, often with impacts around the world.  Science is not a 4 or 8 year process and it would be chaotic for broad swaths of staff doing basic and translational science to be unable to continue their work, unhindered, every time a new administration arrives.  Continuity of skilled staffing and long-term planning by leadership is critical to establishing and carrying out goals such as the major accomplishment of the Human Genome Project and other achievements that might get less attention, such as determining that mind-body practices can protect the brain from detrimental effects of chronic pain (PMID: 23719569) and NIDCD (National Institute on Deafness an

I am specifically appalled at the wording: "This will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives." 

 This puts experts with specialized backgrounds, education, training and experience at full risk from and at the whim of political retaliation.  Of course, a poorly performing employee should be subject to review.  However, as has already been experienced since January 20, 2025, too many employees are being kicked out of their jobs for no other reason than politics, i.e., simply because they weren't bowing to political pressure.

The CSRA permits removals of career employees only ‚Äúfor such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,‚Äù ¬ß 7513(a), and limits new excepted schedules to roles that are inherently ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù or ‚Äúpolicy-determining.‚Äù Reclassifying broad swaths of analysts, engineers, and scientists exceeds any historical exercise of ¬ß 3302 and guts protections Congress has never repealed.

2. Due process:
Once an employee earns competitive status, the Fifth Amendment recognizes a property interest in continued employment. Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985). A regulation cannot extinguish that interest wholesale. Only Congress can do so. Transforming existing positions into an at-will ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù therefore triggers heightened scrutiny, no

   Text sample: Though the proposed justification for the changes in the regulations surrounding federal employees seems reasonable (increase efficiency of management and decrease the chance of employee malfeasance or undue influence), it fails to account for what would be a massive loss of worker/employee job security as well as a significant increase in likely policy volatility from presidential administration to administration. 

In theory, the new paradigm of at will employment could be beneficial if managed reasonably and carefully by a trusted leadership group. However, Mr Trump has given the country ample opportunity to view an alternative potential reality. He has slashed funding and work forces at multiple federal agencies without apparent serious consideration for the implications on workers or public welfare. He has also allowed unelected pseudo officials who are not federal employees nor confirmed by Congress to act on his behalf in the management of federal agencies and employees. This se

   Text sample: I am against OPM, OPM-2025-004-001 and RIN 3206-A080.  I am a strong believer in employers not being able to classify workers as "at-will".  I believe should only be able to fire if the employee is not doing their job.  I believe this to be especially true for civil-service federal employees because the government changes leadership regularly and the employees need that protection or we would not be able to keep the expertise needed for each department.  It is important that they know and follow all the laws concerning their work/department.  They should not be able to follow their own beliefs or the beliefs of the Executive office.  We have a division of power so that does not happen.  I think that if this is passed all the Schedule Policy/Career employees would be asked to follow rules that are not set by Congress (THe legislative body of our government)  If the law needs changing that is the Judicial Branch's responsibility.

Creating a more effective and efficient government is among the most important issues facing the United States today. Executive Order 14171 of January 20, 2025, states ‚ÄúAccountability is essential for all Federal employees, but it is especially important for those who are in policy-influencing positions.‚Äù   There are several ways to help accomplish this goal. Increasing career employee accountability is a vital step in this process and yet the current proposed rule does not accomplish this goal. In fact, it makes it less likely. Thus the proposed rule should not be finalized or published. 
While there are several reasons that this is the case two merit closer consideration.

Merit based hiring ensures that all employees are hired based on skills, rather than on who they know or what organization they belong to.  If the government or any organization the eliminates merit based hiring risks the potential that those hired will be less qualified for their position which will cause errors to be made and affect the ability of the organization to function effectively.  As a retired manager for a nationwide real estate management company, I found that my best hires were those that were interviewed, passed tests that applied to the jobs they were to undertake and put in positions for success for not only themselves but also the company.  I believe that if persons being hired were given positions not on merit and their skills but on who they knew it would demoralize  and have significant consequences for those in the department already in similar positio

   Text sample: I oppose proposed changes that would weaken the competitive hiring rules for career federal employees. 

The rules have always been in place to ensure that federal jobs are awarded based on merit, not political or ideological loyalty. Merit systems protections are designed to remove politicization of the Civil Service to promote the neutrality and professionalism that are essential for a well-functioning government.

Career civil servants are the backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across changing administrations. They are not political appointees‚Äîthey are skilled professionals who carry out the law and serve the public regardless of who is in office. Eliminating merit systems protections, and thereby allowing broader reasons for dismissal and and, in turn, making it easier to replace employees with politically aligned individuals could erode public trust and damage the long-term effectiveness of federal programs.

   Text sample: The reintroduction of Schedule F, now termed Schedule Policy/Career, represents a direct threat to the foundation of a professional, merit-based civil service system in the United States. By allowing for the reclassification of thousands of federal employees as ‚Äúat-will‚Äù political appointees, this policy undermines the nonpartisan expertise that ensures stable and competent governance. Federal workers are traditionally hired based on merit‚Äîeducation, experience, and competitive exams‚Äînot political loyalty. Eroding that standard risks replacing career experts with ideologically motivated appointees, thereby politicizing agencies meant to serve the public impartially.

This shift would have deeply harmful effects across generations. For young professionals and recent graduates entering the workforce, the loss of job security and the increasing influence of political affiliation over qualifications would discourage many from pursuing public service altogether, leading to a talent vacuum i

   Text sample: As a scientist, I strongly oppose the proposed Schedule F regulation that would reclassify thousands of federal civil service positions‚Äîincluding those central to scientific grantmaking‚Äîas political appointees. This rule would fundamentally undermine the merit-based, expert-driven foundations of federal scientific agencies such as the NIH and NSF.

The proposed regulation‚Äôs language explicitly targets roles involving ‚Äúsubstantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking,‚Äù including the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of grant applications, and the selection of grant recipients. By reclassifying these positions as ‚Äúpolicymaking,‚Äù the rule would allow them to be filled or vacated at the discretion of the administration, stripping away longstanding civil service protections

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed regulation that would reinstate ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù and reclassify thousands of federal civil service positions‚Äîincluding those with discretionary roles in federal grantmaking‚Äîas political appointments. This proposal, if implemented, would severely undermine the integrity, objectivity, and stability of the federal research enterprise.
Specifically, I am gravely concerned by the proposal‚Äôs intent to politicize the leadership of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by reclassifying all Institute and Center Directors, and potentially Division Directors, as political appointees. This move would erode the foundational principle that federal science and public health leadership should be based on scientific expertise, peer-reviewed accomplishments, and continuity in public service‚Äînot political allegiance or ideological conformity.

I have served on policy-making panels for the NIH, and I can assure you that policy is not made by any individual director; instead the priorities of any Institute are established by a months-long process of consultation among leading scientists from across the country, with additional opportunity for public comment.  These directors often have decades of experience at NIH, which is important for continuity in managing the institute affairs, and it would be extremely disruptive if they were to be replaced every four years, especially with people not familiar with NIH operations.

   Text sample: This proposed policy (Schedule Policy/Career) will be highly detrimental to the US federal workforce, the US government as a whole, and everyday American citizens.

The "lack of meaningful definition or criteria [of what positions are policy-influencing] will likely result in inconsistent application of Schedule Policy/Career across agencies" [1]. OPM's estimate of 50,000 positions, as well as previous history of Schedule F's implementation, leaves open the possibility that the majority of the federal workforce could come under these new rules [1]. At a minimum, more clarification is needed as to what positions qualify as policy-influencing.

These rules would enable employees that are classified as Schedule Policy/Career to be fired at will - which leaves open the likelihood that federal employees could be fired for political reasons [1].

The NIH is the world's leader in biomedical research funding BECAUSE its funding decisions are made by independent teams of experienced experts (all of them working scientists themselves) which is the best way of ensuring, as far as possible, that the most promising research gets funded.

But now I understand that NIH career civil service scientists and administrators are being reclassified as Schedule F, along with the massive reduction in NIH funding. The grants they award allow scientists to develop treatment modalities for current illnesses and prepare for future events that would negatively affect the health of the nation. Loss of grant funding means that many clinical trials will be terminated prematurely, putting patients at risk and also negating the already collected data from the trials, in essence wasting the funds already spent. MDs and PHD candidates conducting NIH funded clinical research will also be impacted. For example, at a time of severe shor

Re: ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 

Dear Office of Personnel Management: 

I submit these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) Proposed Rule ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). 

I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule.

1.	I am retired Federal employee. I worked under both Democratic and Republican Presidents and, once policies were set, did my best to implement them as best I could.

2.	Based upon my 31 years of professional experience, I believe that civil servants should be hired based primarily on expertise. If government employees feared they would be disciplined for voicing professional opinions that Administration leadership did not like, they would be reluctant to off

   Text sample: This comment is submitted in strong opposition to any proposed reclassification of federal employees under a new "Schedule Policy/Career" or similar mechanism that would strip career civil servants of their long-standing merit system protections. Such a change represents a fundamental assault on the principles of good governance, effective public service, and the very foundation of a non-partisan federal workforce. The implications of implementing Schedule Policy/Career are far-reaching and profoundly detrimental, threatening to undermine the efficiency, integrity, and public trust in the United States government. Specifically, I oppose these proposed changes as they will erode merit-based principles, pressure federal employees to be loyal to current and future administrations instead of upholding their oath to the U.S. Constitution. They will also undermine expertise and institutional knowledge and weaken accountability.

   Text sample: "Approved on January 16, 1883, the Pendleton Act established a merit-based system of selecting government officials and supervising their work.

Following the assassination of President James A. Garfield by a disgruntled job seeker, Congress passed the Pendleton Act in January of 1883. The act took its name from long-time reformer Senator George Hunt Pendleton of Ohio and was signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur, who had become an ardent reformer after Garfield‚Äôs assassination.

The Pendleton Act provided that federal government jobs be awarded on the basis of merit and that government employees be selected through competitive exams. The act also made it unlawful to fire or demote for political reasons employees who were covered by the law. The law further forbade requiring employees to give political service or contributions. The Civil Service Commission was established to enforce this act.

   Text sample: This regulation is deficient in several areas.  For one, it fails to properly describe the legal distinction between the Supreme Court decision that shields the President from conviction or lawsuits based on actions that may not be legal and those of employees who are ordered to commit actions against statutory requirements under the threat of coercion as they are designated "at will".  The regulation at a minimum should define that an at will federal employee may not be compelled or face any disciplinary action for failing to follow an order that is in violation of statutory provisions.  The regulation should define an appeal process for an at will employee against who action is taking for failing to perform an illegal order.  Failure to address even these basic requirements should result in the rule being reproposed with these components to allow the public to sufficient review and comment on how the government intends to address these requirements, or risk a violation of the APA.

   Text sample: I am a PhD student studying biology in an NIH-funded lab at Harvard. I urge the Office of Personnel Management in the strongest possible terms not to go through with this proposed rule. Politicizing grantmaking positions at NIH and other research-funding agencies would be catastrophic for science in the US and for the long-term health of citizens.

Below, I explain two major reasons why this proposed rule would be so disastrous:
(1) A lack of dependably stable, long-term funding will reduce scientific innovation.
(2) Politicizing NIH will degrade the scientific integrity of research done in the US.


(1) The importance of stable, long-term funding:

Scientific research requires long, steady investment. It can take years to get a new experiment working, let alone to collect data and turn that data into a useful finding that advances the field.

   Text sample: I am writing to express concern over several aspects of the proposed rule, which, while presented as a means to enhance performance and accountability, raises significant issues that may undermine the merit-based principles of the civil service and erode employee protections.

First, the rule appears to significantly weaken procedural safeguards for federal employees, particularly regarding adverse actions such as suspensions and removals. By reducing the time employees have to respond to proposed discipline and limiting the ability of agencies to consider mitigating factors, the rule increases the risk of arbitrary or politically motivated terminations. These changes may discourage whistleblowing and chill dissent, ultimately harming the public interest.

Second, the rule seeks to accelerate performance-based removals, but it does so at the cost of due process. The proposed changes to performance improvement plans (PIPs), including shorter durations and fewer requirements for agency s

- Compromise patient outcomes by prioritizing political loyalty over scientific expertise in research leadership

- Waste taxpayer resources through constant leadership turnover that disrupts multi-year research initiatives

- Undermine public safety by politicizing decisions about which diseases and treatments receive federal research funding

- Damage American competitiveness as other nations maintain merit-based scientific leadership while we abandon it

As a clinical psychologist dedicated to federally funded research on substance use and its impact on families, I witness daily the profound difference that evidence-based interventions make in saving lives. It is from this critical vantage point that I offer my public comment on the proposed government process changes.

The Imperative of Non-Partisan Science

It is deeply concerning to observe a perception that grant-making is synonymous with policy-making. This misunderstanding threatens the very foundation of scientific progress. The singular goal of grant-making is to foster work that expands our scientific knowledge. Consequently, grants must be reviewed and funded solely on the merit and potential of the proposed science. Science, by its very nature, is non-partisan and non-political; its pursuit of truth should never be swayed by shifting political winds.

Politicizing grantmaking positions at NIH and other research-funding agencies would be catastrophic for science in the US and for the long-term health of citizens.

Below, I explain two major reasons why this proposed rule would be so disastrous:
(1) A lack of dependably stable, long-term funding will reduce scientific innovation.
(2) Politicizing NIH will degrade the scientific integrity of research done in the US.

(1) The importance of stable, long-term funding:
Scientific research requires long, steady investment. It can take years to get a new experiment working, let alone to collect data and turn that data into a useful finding that advances the field. Especially for major incurable diseases of our time‚Äîlike Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and various types of cancer‚Äîbreakthroughs in finding a cure require decade

As a clinical mental health provider and scientist dedicated to federally funded research on substance use and recovery, I witness daily the profound difference that evidence-based interventions make in saving lives. It is from this critical vantage point that I offer my public comment on the proposed government process changes.
It is deeply concerning to observe a perception that grant-making is synonymous with policy-making. This misunderstanding threatens the very foundation of scientific progress. The singular goal of grant-making is to foster work that expands our scientific knowledge. Consequently, grants must be reviewed and funded solely on the merit and potential of the proposed science. Science, by its very nature, is non-partisan and non-political; its pursuit of truth should never be swayed by shifting political winds.

They are leaders in their fields, from science to law to economics, and they have chosen to take a position in the service of their country in order to make it a better place. One of the primary reasons for this confidence in the expertise of government decision makers is that they are chosen based on objective qualifications and are bound to report the truth, regardless of politics or public pressure. It is not always an easy job to conduct an analysis or make a decision on highly technical subjects under intense political pressure, but due to the apolitical nature of the civil service I have always had confidence that this process is carried out faithfully.

   Text sample: I am a scientist at a biotechnology company and I regularly interact with NIH researchers and reference their work. I urge the Office of Personnel Management in the strongest possible terms not to go through with this proposed rule. Politicizing grantmaking positions at NIH and other research-funding agencies would be catastrophic for the prosperity of science in the US and for the long-term health of citizens.

Below, I explain two major reasons why this proposed rule would be so disastrous:
(1) A lack of dependably stable, long-term funding will reduce scientific innovation.
(2) Politicizing NIH will degrade the scientific integrity of research done in the US.

(1) The importance of stable, long-term funding:
Scientific research requires long, steady investment. It can take years to get a new experiment working, let alone to collect data and turn that data into a useful finding that advances the field. Especially for major incurable diseases of our time‚Äîlike Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,

OPM-2025-0004; RIN 3206-AO80 "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service".

I oppose the move to reclassify federal workers making them more susceptible to the whims of political forces. Our federal workforce needs to remain a-political and unbiased. They need to be assured of their positions regardless of the administration in power at any given time. They hold institutional knowledge and expertise that is essential for the functioning of the government and the maintenance of trust in our government. Our civil service workforce should remain that--civil. This is not possible if their protections erode, and their jobs depend on administrative tests of loyalty.

The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 established that hiring

merit, thus replacing a corrupt patronage system. In other words, the
Pendleton Act specified that federal employees should be hired on the
basis of what they know rather than who they know. Advancement and
promotions were to be based on actual achievement and meeting
performance goals, not based on campaign contributions, votes delivered,

   Text sample: I am very concerned about this proposed rule, which appears to be an overt attempt to politicize decision making around the funding of scientific grants.  

The United States has been, up until now, the world leader in biomedical research thanks not just to the wise and strategic investments in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) over the last half century.  Not only has this investment resulted in breakthrough scientific discoveries that have saved millions of lives in the United States, and countless others around the world, but it has also produced an incredible return on investment, generating $2.5 for every dollar spent in economic activity in the Unites States, creating countless high-skill  and good-paying jobs for Americans. Nevertheless, the funding of the NIH is not the only critical element supporting this incredible success. The other foundational piece is that funding decisions on particular scientific grants are made based on the fair, unbiased, and merit-based review

   Text sample: This regulation will not improve performance, accountability or responsiveness among personnel at the NIH and NSF; rather it will have precisely the opposite effect. It deprioritizes the objective assessment that is at the heart of scientific discovery. Decisions to fund scientific research based on objective review processes by Federal agencies and institutes such as the NIH and NSF without political interference in place for decades have been highly successful in generating discoveries that have resulted in new treatments and cures. This new regulation would result in the reclassification of all NIH Institute and Center Directors as well as Institute Division Directors as political appointees and thereby dramatically politicize NIH and increase the turnover of key positions, limiting longer-term planning and execution.

As a clinical psychologist I am strongly opposed to this change. I am dedicated to conducting federally funded substance use research with the goal of savings the lives of those who struggle with substance use disorders. In my position as a scientist and clinician, I have witnessed the difference that evidence-based interventions make in saving lives. It is imperative from my perspective that I offer my public comment on the proposed government process changes and my disagreement with this proposed change.

Reclassifying NIH grantmaking roles as "policymaking positions" subject to political appointment risks severely damaging the integrity of federal scientific research funding, one of America's most impressive areas of achievement. 
 
Politicizing leadership positions like Institute and Center Directors would undermine merit-based grant decisions, increase disruptive turnover, and jeopardize long-term research planning. Scientific expertise, not political considerations, should guide the allocation of federal research funds.
 
Schedule F threatens to erode the scientific integrity of agencies like NIH, hindering progress and undermining public trust in science. I urge the exclusion of these critical science-related roles from this regulation.

I am deeply concerned about the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones.

While I cannot speak to other sorts of grants, I do know that having political appointees be responsible for grantmaking decisions for scientific grants will be harmful for scientific progress.

As a federal employee submitting this comment in my personal capacity, I strongly oppose this proposed rule. This policy would bring an unprecedented level of politicization into the federal workforce and lead to harmful consequences for the American public. 

I work in health policy, specifically on one of the government health insurance programs. These programs represent a significant share of the federal budget and are enormously complex. As such, it can take years to develop the subject matter knowledge necessary to be an effective steward of a health insurance program‚Äôs policies and operations. 

If finalized, this rule will diminish the importance of expertise in favor of political loyalty and will lead to a less experienced workforce that is ill-equipped to run the health insurance programs that millions of Americans ‚Äì regardless of political affiliation ‚Äì rely on.

While I agree that an elected president should be able to appoint some number of federal workers in order help move his agenda forward, converting thousands of additional federal workers to ‚Äúat-will‚Äù employees (possibly as many as 50,000 vs the current approximately 4000) will significantly degrade the level of service provided every federal agency.  It will be a logistical nightmare, open the door for corruption and enable abuse of power by every incoming administration.  American citizens expect that the personnel they deal with in the federal government will be knowledgeable and unbiased.  The only way to ensure this is to maintain a federal workforce that is primarily merit based and free from political pressure.

In other words, the bar is very, very high for who should serve as a director for ANY section of NIH or NSF.

Re: Opposition to Proposed Rule titled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and

I am writing to express my unequivocal opposition to the proposed rule titled ‚ÄúImproving
Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.‚Äù This proposal would
significantly undermine the merit-based structure of the federal civil service, introduce
unconstitutional obligations, destabilize public employment, and violate core tenets of the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA).
The U.S. civil service was designed to protect professionalism, impartiality, and

safeguards without meaningful safeguards, this rule threatens to replace a system based
on merit with one vulnerable to political pressure and favoritism.

     The proposed rules change on procedures for taking action against civil servants is appalling. These changes are being proposed to make it easier to fire employees without cause and due process. By reclassifying a broad category of federal employees, it makes it easier to fire employees for political reasons. It has nothing to do with "accountability" or "responsiveness," convenient buzzwords to hide the true intent of this change.
     Staffing the government with competent and conscientious employees is vital for the fair and responsible functioning of our country. The vast majority of federal employees are hard working and honest, and are doing their best every day, with little acclaim and low pay.

 I. Constitutional Violations and Separation of Powers Concerns

Due Process Violations

The proposal flagrantly violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.The rule admits that tenured federal employees have property interests in their positions, yet seeks to strip those protections without adequate procedural safeguards. The proposal's attempt to distinguish between "legislative" and "adjudicative" actions is legally specious‚Äîthe Supreme Court in *Board of Regents v.

   Text sample: A professional civil service is critical to maintaining government services on behalf of the American people, and to ensuring democracy and the peaceful transfers of power between different political administrations. Those who help political leadership align the work of the government to their priorities - the policy positions listed in this proposed rule - are important leaders who can help provide the background for why things are how they are and then help new leadership pivot to make new policy priorities work. Civil Servants need to be able to speak truth to power and share why certain ideas will not be in the best interests of the American People. Government, by design, is not a business, and many of the services provided are not profitable - mail delivery, for example, would no longer go to rural addresses if profit were the main motive.

   Text sample: The revival or expansion of a Schedule F-type policy poses a serious threat to the competence and integrity of the federal workforce.

   Text sample: Let us first remember the history of why the civil service went from being politically appointed to being civilly decided and merit-based and exam based..

President James A. Garfield, was shot by a civil servant office seeker who felt that he had been denied his position based upon the politics of the situation. Additionally at that time, too much of legislator and executive time was being given to the hiring and firing decisions that were necessary to run the civil service.

President James A. Garfield (1831-1881) is shot by Charles Guiteau at the Baltimore & Potomac Railroad Station in Washington, D.C on July 2, 1881. Although he was severely wounded, President Garfield initially survived the shooting. He never fully recovered though, and passed away on September 19, a mere six months after his inauguration as President.

Second, the proposed rule would not address the problems it identifies. The proposal lists its goal as to ‚Äúincrease career employee accountability.‚Äù Reclassifying a large percentage of the workforce would not result in a workforce that is more ‚Äúaccountable‚Äù- it will instead create an atmosphere of fear that will harm the effectiveness of federal agencies.

   Text sample: As a federal employee commenting in my personal capacity, I oppose the proposed rule. 

Ultimately, the proposed ruling does not adequately address the problems it identifies with the federal workforce and agency accountability (i.e., ‚Äúincrease career employee accountability‚Äù). Reclassifying a large percentage of the federal workforce as ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù and ‚Äúat-will‚Äù employees would not and could not result in a workforce that is more ‚Äúaccountable‚Äù- rather it will create undue burden, stress, and instability for employees - removing their ability to focus on their mission and protecting the interests of the American people. 

Additionally, allowing agencies to fire employees for political reasons (i.e., ‚Äúundermin[ing] the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives) does not increase or build employee accountability, rather this solution does not cater to or seem to solve the employee problems proposed by OPM. Federal employees who feel they are unde

As a federal employee, speaking for my self and not for my agency, I am concerned about OPM‚Äôs new rule OPM-2025-0004(RIN:3206-AO80) proposed for how prevent partisanship of the federal work force. As a federal employee it is important we put the well being of the country above our political opinions. However, a responsible federal employee must do their due diligence to inform policy makers and the general public in any administration if a proposed action would work. Early in my career in the  Corps of Engineers, I was tasked with figuring out the costs of putting large flood gates along the Jersey Shore. While there was some skepticism in my office if this would work, we did our due diligence and looked at the feasibility. By completing a feasibility study we were able to determine building said gates would not be worth the cost. In doing the research on feasibility we found information that would assist the federal and state gov

Re: ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004
 Dear Office of Personnel Management: 
I, Lorraine Beahm Shipp, write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule.
I was employed at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington D.C. for 35 years.  I passed a Civil Service exam and was employed as a GS-2 Physical Science Technician. My employment was conditional for 3 years in which I acquired the technical skills and scientific knowledge needed to perform my job.  After the three years, my job was protected by the Merit System Protections Board which gave me the assurance that I could continue to support my family.

   Text sample: As someone who understands the complexity and importance of budget development in federal agencies, I am concerned that reclassifying career civil servants into a new ‚ÄúPolicy/Career‚Äù schedule with fewer protections will severely undermine the technical rigor, continuity, and impartiality essential to accurate and responsible budget formulation. My concerns include:


Loss of Nonpartisan Expertise: Federal budget analysts and program examiners play a crucial role in preparing budget estimates based on objective analysis, long-term planning, and detailed program knowledge. Allowing these positions to be converted to political appointees risks replacing seasoned, apolitical experts with individuals lacking technical experience or prioritizing short-term political agendas over fiscal responsibility.

Disruption of Continuity: Budget formulation is a multiyear process requiring consistency in data management, program evaluation, and inter-agency collaboration. The potential for mass reclass

   Text sample: I strongly oppose this proposed rule.

The reasons given in the proposal for this action are inadequate. It is not difficult to fire civil servants provided there is a valid reason to fire them and management follows the appropriate procedure. The surveys cited in the proposal do not amount to satisfactory evidence that civil servants need to be made much easier to fire. Surveys can be easily manipulated to provide the desired results. The proposal also includes anecdotes alleging resistance to Presidents' agendas from within the civil service; these anecdotes also do not justify the proposed action. 

Agencies already have many measures in place to ensure that civil servants continue to do their work, upholding their oaths to serve the American public and the rule of law, regardless of their person opinions of the current administration. If work is delayed, it is often due to litigation, which can stall federal work for years. One thing that tends to trigger litigation is when an agen

   Text sample: I am deeply concerned about how vulnerable this proposal is to abuse. Specifically, the reduced internship hour requirements, broadened eligibility, and non-competitive conversion pathways could allow political appointees or agency leadership to circumvent the merit-based hiring process and place ideologically aligned individuals into permanent federal positions (read: only loyalists get hired).

This risk is particularly high if agencies use the new GS-11 starting grades and extended conversion periods to preferentially hire loyalists over qualified subject-matter experts, especially in roles that require impartiality and professional expertise.

To protect the integrity of the federal workforce, I urge OPM to NOT implement this. If they MUST do something like this, PLEASE include some safeguards:

1. Ensure these programs are not used to bypass competitive hiring.
2. Require independent review or audit of intern-to-permanent conversions across agencies.

   Text sample: The fact that the prevention of unwanted "political preferences" for government employees is listed first as a reason to institute this rule, whereas preventing corruption or incompetence is listed later, shows that the true purpose of this rule is to make it easier to fill the civil service with loyalists to one man rather than to loyalists to the Constitution and the rule of law. The civil service is essential at this point in time where the Executive branch is violating the Constitution with ICE's illegal kidnappings of lawful permanent residents to prisons or other unknown locales outside the country. Loosening the rules to allow for arbitrary firings will only increase the difficulty that the civil service will have in fulfilling the country's supreme law, the Constitution.

to the changing whims of political winds. This holds especially for
those scientists giving their professional lives to the National

The employee is penalized further by the district court as the file ruled upon was incomplete and could be completely fabricated.

Disruption of Long-Term Workflows: Federal efficiency depends on experienced career staff who understand agency-specific systems, procedures, and goals.

   Text sample: the rule risks undermining the fundamental goals of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, which seeks to strengthen public health systems, improve healthcare accessibility, and promote a healthier, more effective government that can meet the needs of all Americans.

The MAHA agenda emphasizes the need for stable, knowledgeable, and highly skilled professionals within public health agencies. The reclassification of positions under the new "Policy/Career" category could lead to increased turnover and disruptions within critical roles. Public health agencies require continuity and long-term expertise, especially during public health crises, to ensure quick and efficient responses. This rule may weaken the stability and effectiveness of these agencies at a time when it is most needed.

The key phrase that seems to guide the main principle for the proposed changes revolves around "enabl[ing] the President and his appointed agency heads to hold Schedule Policy/Career employees meaningfully accountable for their performance and conduct." This seems to hold a great deal of weight for the vague purpose for power sought after with these proposed changes. I fear that the desire to being able to find and fire workers for "injecting partisanship into the performance of their official duties" when promoting policy is the key factor here.  What are the key motivations behind this action?

From what can be gathered in the detailed briefing, the argument relies on fearing that government agencies might not agree with the politician in power and work against proposed changes. As a result, there needs to be a strong determination to simply fire people more frequently (se

Of course we of the reviewers have our own biases too, but the group peer review process helps us mitigate those biases and rate proposals fairly on the basis of their merits and credibility.

Subject: Public Comment Opposing Proposal to Designate NIH Directors and Institute Leaders
as Political Appointees
To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposal that would reclassify National
Institutes of Health (NIH) directors and institute leaders as political appointees, especially in
light of the proposed language suggesting that grantmaking constitutes a form of policymaking.
As a nurse practitioner specializing in infectious diseases and a PhD-prepared nurse scientist
with a funded program of research focused on improving HIV and tuberculosis treatment
outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa, I have witnessed firsthand how critical the independence and
scientific integrity of NIH leadership are to sustainin

I write to object strongly to Schedule F classification for federal workers. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a statutory obligation to protect the merit system under federal law (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101 et seq.). The quality of the civil service ‚Äì and the work it does ‚Äì relies on hiring and promoting its workforce based on merit, and merit alone. 
Furthermore, by allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which ended the ‚Äúspoils system‚Äù of hiring and promotion. This would reduce employee accountability and could silence the voices of experts who disagree with current political agendas. In time this would weaken the professionalism of the civil service and negatively impact the consistency and delivery of government agency programs for all Americans.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Anne Irene McGill Gorsuch Burford¬†(/Àà…°…îÀêrs åt É/¬†GOR-sutch; April 21, 1942 ‚Äì July 18, 2004), also known as¬†Anne M. Gorsuch, was an American attorney and politician. Between 1981 and 1983, under President¬†Ronald Reagan, she was the first woman to serve as¬†Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency¬†(EPA).
In 1982, Congress charged that the EPA had mishandled the $1.6 billion toxic waste¬†Superfund¬†by taking certain inappropriate and potentially illegal actions including withholding disbursements in order to affect a California political campaign. When Congress demanded records from Gorsuch, she refused and as a result became the first¬†agency¬†director in U.S. history to be cited for¬†contempt of Congress.[8][9]

To the Office of Personnel Management:

I am writing to express my profound opposition to the proposed rule, OPM-2025-0004-0001. As a concerned United States citizen, I believe this policy change would have detrimental consequences for our federal workforce and the integrity, performance, accountability, and responsiveness of our government.

During my career, I had the opportunity to work closely with many employees of several federal agencies.  All of these career employees were dedicated professionals who were recruited as non-partisan experts in their fields.  These employees were committed to serving the best interests of our country in non-partisan ways. Under current practices, Federal agencies recruit  employees based on merit-based principles; that recruitment process must be maintained to ensure the integrity and performance of our government.

The proposed rule will erode the merit-based principles that have long been

   Text sample: Please do not harm America's leadership in science and medicine!!!  Decisions to fund scientific research based on objective review processes by Federal agencies and institutes such as the NIH and NSF without political interference in place for decades have been highly successful in generating discoveries that have resulted in new treatments and cures. 

America has been the leader for scientific discovery and innovation. To continue to be this leader, we must keep scientific integrity at the forefron and not turn the NIH into a political institution.

This new regulation would result in the reclassification of all NIH Institute and Center Directors as well as Institute Division Directors as political appointees and thereby dramatically politicize NIH and increase the turnover of key positions, limiting longer-term planning and execution.

OPM-2025-0004; RIN 3206-AO80 "Improving Performance, Accountability
and Responsiveness in the Civil Service".

I oppose the move to reclassify federal workers making them more
susceptible to the whims of political forces. Our federal workforce
needs to remain a-political and unbiased. They need to be assured of
their positions regardless of the administration in power at any given
time. They hold institutional knowledge and expertise that is
essential for the functioning of the government and the maintenance of
trust in our government. Our civil service workforce should remain
that--civil. This is not possible if their protections erode, and
their jobs depend on administrative tests of loyalty.

These are my primary concerns:
1. This proposed rule undermines Merit System Protections
Schedule F represents a sweeping change to the civil service system
that bypasses the competitive hiring process and allows for the
removal of career professionals

   Text sample: The incompetence of supervisors in removing so-called "underperforming employees" is caused by the Presidential incompetence at picking supervisors. The only crisis of incompetence anywhere in the federal workforce is the one at the top, not the working-class people at the bottom carrying out the people's business.

The question before us, then, is why is this rule being proposed? It is being proposed in order to aid and abet the incompetence at the top of the federal workforce. The purpose of this rule has nothing to do with its justification, nothing to do with its text, save for the phrase "they will become at-will employees". The purpose of this rule is to give Donald Trump and Elon Musk the right to fire anyone they wish, so that they may then give away those jobs to anyone willing to break the law for them. 

All claims of procedures to keep federal workforce positions "non-political" are [redacted]. They have no basis in reality. They are empty words, devoid of meaning, because

   Text sample: As a patient advocate and supporter of evidence-based public policy, I strongly oppose the proposed rule enabling the reclassification of federal employees into a new Schedule F category.
This proposed rule would severely jeopardize the integrity and continuity of scientific research across the federal government, including at the National Eye Institute (NEI), where apolitical, expert leadership is essential to advancing breakthroughs in vision science and protecting the eye health of millions of Americans. Reclassifying career scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to Administration.
Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads to the development of new diagnostics, treatments, and cures for conditions that affect nearly

Political appointees should not be making scientific funding decisions.  This is extremely detrimental to progress, and will delay any efforts to progress the goals of the administration.  This progress would be directly delayed by not funding rigorous science and by funding non-rigorous science, decisions that would be better made by those individuals with scientific expertise and experience.  A better way to progress administration's goals would be to introduce new funding opportunties that address the issues, and then the scientific experts review and grant funding to those with merit.  

Grant-making is not policy-making and it is concerning that it is viewed that way.  Grant-making has the goal of supporting work to increase scientific knowledge. Grants should be reviewed and funded based on the quality and potential of the science they propose. Science is non-partisan and non-political.

I am writing to express strong opposition to any effort to reinstate Schedule F in the federal
workforce (Document ID OPM-2025-0004-0001). This proposal undermines foundational
principles of merit-based civil service, invites undue political interference, and risks
violating statutory and constitutional protections. Placed in the context of Congressional
proposals, Schedule F serves as an Executive justification to restrict merit systems
protections, enforce partisanship within the Federal workforce, and reduce expertise and
institutional memory within the Federal system. It is a regressive proposal.
1. Undermines Merit System Protections
Schedule F represents a sweeping change to the civil service system that bypasses the
competitive hiring process and allows for the removal of career professionals without
cause. This contravenes the intent of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act and
longstanding statutory p

   Text sample: I strongly object to introducing or reviving the "Schedule F" classification for federal workers. Even if taken at face value, making it easier to fire civil servants INCREASES the risk of those positions becoming politicized and partisan, it does not reduce them. These federal agencies belong to US, the American people, they do vital work for us, and being able to hollow out these agencies is stealing vital expertise and services that rightfully belong to our citizens.
Furthermore, this administration has DEFINITELY not earned the trust to take their claims at face value, given the disingenuous and highly partisan attacks on goverment workers across multiple agencies.

This plan jeopardizes the civil service system's foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit. Notably, President Trump has supported this merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established

This is true regardless of the party or individuals who are in control of the Executive.

During the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union, dogma was imposed from the top down, much like the anti-DEI dogma that is erasing language and jobs in the US lately. Or the vaccine "skepticism" that will maim and kill Americans in the the coming years.

   Text sample: I strongly object to the introduction or revival of the "Schedule F" classification for federal workers.

The merit system ensures that government positions are awarded based on qualifications, experience, and performance‚Äînot political loyalty or affiliation. This system has safeguarded the professionalism, impartiality, and competence of the federal workforce for over a century.

While President Trump has previously framed Schedule F as a merit-based initiative through Executive Order 14173, the reality is that it would erode, not enhance, the merit system. By permitting the dismissal of career civil servants without cause, Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883.

   Text sample: I vehemently oppose the proposed OPM rule to reinstate Schedule F, not only as a destructive policy but as a grave threat to the constitutional framework of our government. This rule fundamentally undermines the very spirit of the separation of powers and the design of the Executive Branch.
The creation of a vast, nonpartisan civil service was a deliberate act by Congress to ensure the impartial execution of laws, grounded in expertise and merit, not political whims. By seeking to reclassify tens of thousands of career civil servants into at-will political appointees, this rule arrogates unchecked power to the Executive, blurring the essential distinction between policy-makers and policy-implementers.

I write to express my concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary employment protections for individuals serving within the federal workforce and could transform positions which rely on specific government service expertise to political ones. The proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù would actually reduce performance, accountability, and responsiveness of the federal workforce. Federal employees play an essential role in improving the lives of all Americans as well as informing critical policy decisions associated with their individual positions. Federal agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule due to the following:

   Text sample: Congress should not be stripped of its oversight jurisdiction by politicizing government employees. The executive branch of the government exists as an entity that function s in a non-partisan non-political way. In fact, they are to be buffered from the extreme changes of course that can occur during changes in the administration. 

Congress is elected by We the People. They are elected to represent us in the legislative branch, authorizing and appropriating funds in accordance with the people's wishes. The government, purposely according to the Constitution, does not change directions on a whim. It is like an enormous ship, which takes a good time to change direction. The government would wind up firing all with knowledge every time the Administration changes,. The Executive Branch would become hamstrung, and Congress rendered nearly irrelevant.

The proposed regulation, which would create a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù classification within the excepted service, directly contradicts the foundational principles of a merit-based civil service. It would allow thousands of career federal employees, those labeled as ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù, to be stripped of the rights and protections afforded under Title 5 of the U.S. Code. These individuals could be terminated without cause, without notice, and without recourse, removing the procedural safeguards that have long protected the integrity of our nonpartisan civil service.

ACTION:
Proposed rule.

SUMMARY:
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing a rule to increase career employee accountability. Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct. The proposed rule lets policy-influencing positions be moved into Schedule Policy/Career. These positions will remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis. Yet they will be at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals. This will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.

   Text sample: As a private U.S. citizen who values ethics and accountability, I am opposed to this regulatory change for the following reasons:

1. This rule does not prevent civil servants from being fired for purely political reasons. How does this update protect civil servants from managers who may be abusing their authority? If a civil servant is wrongly fired, what actions can they take for compensation?

2. This regulation will make it harder to recruit talented civil servants into these positions. I support increasing the pay of any government employee in an at-will position to compensate them for the increased risk of being let go. I support making the salaries of at-will positions comparable to and competitive with similar positions in the private sector.

3. This regulatory change increases the risk for corruption and prohibited practices within the government because employees may be afraid to speak out against corrupt officials (especially if these officials are higher ranked) because an

Their lives revolved around the Great Root System, a vast, intricate network of burrows and tunnels that provided warmth in winter and cool shade in summer. Overseeing its meticulous upkeep were the Burrow-Keepers, a respected guild of moles, voles, and diligent mice. They were chosen for their keen eyes, steady paws, and an innate understanding of the earth's murmurs.

For generations, a simple tradition guided their selection: a candidate would spend a season assisting an elder Burrow-Keeper, learning the subtle art of root-mending and tunnel-shoring, and then demonstrate their practical skills in a quiet, unannounced inspection. Competence was the root of their success, and the woods thrived.

My concerns begin with the very summary provided for the regulation. It states ‚ÄúThis will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives‚Äù. 

Firing people who have engaged in misconduct or have poor performance is hardly a new problem, so it seems that existing processes that have worked for decades are sufficient. And in particular, those reasons both lend themselves to writing concrete rules for any given position and clear documentation of wrongdoing, making any appeals process easy to resolve. Wanting to fire people for misconduct or poor performance does not feel like it needs a new regulation.

I am writing to oppose Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) proposed by OPM, Docket ID (OPM-2025-0004), and RIN (3206-AO80). The roles presumed to be included in Schedule P/C should be filled by individuals appointed without political agenda. Decisions made in these roles should benefit all Americans and not only fulfill the whims of a political party (this can go both ways depending on the political party of the president). Ethics would be a bigger concern. If the large number of proposed Schedule P/C employees can be fired at will, these employees will feel pressure to make decisions based on political loyalty to keep their job and will not necessarily make balanced considerations to make policy to benefit all American citizens. Mass firings of the large number of proposed Schedule P/C employees between administrations will weaken government expertise needed for complex work, hinder efficiency, and in turn will weaken continuity and the delivery of public services.

Not only does it take a lot of time and money to train highly skilled workers in complex government systems, keeping the civil service non-partisan prevents abridgement of the current merit system rules that prevent favoritism and discrimination based on race, sex, national origin, religion, marital status and sexual orientation by management. For example, if At Will employment is enacted, a Government employee would be able to quit without notice and there would be no protection to the government to enact a notice period without an act of Congress. Further, At Will employment is not subverted by the implied contractual principles of good faith and fair dealing. The Federal Government would still have to a

While these positions would technically remain part of the competitive service, the rule would eliminate essential due process safeguards, allowing agencies to terminate employees without the standard adverse action procedures or appeals processes. 

Such a change undermines the foundational principles of a nonpartisan civil service. By removing protections from employees in policy-making and policy-advocating roles, the rule opens the door to politicization, enabling administrations to replace experienced professionals with individuals chosen for their political

   Text sample: The rule's discussion of Free Enterprise Fund repeatedly explains that MSPB administrative judges (AJs) cannot constitutionally enjoy removal protections because the politically appointed Board members have such protections, impermissibly creating dual for cause removal protections. But the President has in fact removed at least one such Board member and has argued in court that the Board members' removal protections are unconstitutional. If this is so, then there is no Free Enterprise problem with the AJs' removal protections. The rule addresses this in cursory and unconvincing fashion, ignoring that the government is trying to argue both ways. If the government truly believes the Board members' removal protections are unconstitutional, and prevails on that view, that obviates the constitutional need under Free Enterprise Fund to vitiate the AJs' protections. Additionally, while citing Arthrex, the rule does not convincingly explain why another method of control would not suffice to a

The justification offered for this rule is built on a series of misleading premises. It inaccurately characterizes federal employees as resistant to carrying out lawful directives based on personal preference, ignoring the fundamental legal and ethical obligations that guide civil service behavior. Refusing to execute an order that is unlawful, unconstitutional, or inconsistent with statutory authority is not insubordination ‚Äî it is adherence to the oath of office and longstanding legal requirements.
The rule also implies that exercising First Amendment rights during personal time is grounds for professional censure, a position that is constitutionally indefensible. Federal employees, like all citizens, retain their rights to free speech and lawful political participation outside of work hours. The Hatch Act already governs appropriate boundaries; this rule seeks to create new, vague standards that would chill lawful ex

There are calls by ignorant government newbies to build audit programs when they already exist, have goals, and are working effectively (e.g., CMS).

First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants‚Äîparticularly those involved in policy-making or analysis‚Äîto be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing.

Subject: Opposition to the Proposed Changes Regarding "Schedule Policy/Career" Employees

I respectfully submit the following comments opposing the proposed rule, which would significantly weaken essential civil service protections. The rule, if finalized, would inflict serious harm on career civil servants in at least the following ten ways:

I. Elimination of Due Process Rights
The proposed rule exempts Schedule Policy/Career employees from Chapter 75 and Chapter 43 procedural protections (5 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 7512, 4303)‚Äã. Employees could be removed without prior notice, meaningful explanation, or the opportunity for neutral third-party appeal. This violates fundamental tenets of procedural fairness and significantly deviates from longstanding civil service protections recognized by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.

II. Creation of At-Will Employment Without Safeguards
Although Schedule Policy/Career positions are technically designated as

   Text sample: Proposed Schedule P/C misrepresents career civil servants, implying legal/operational concerns justify removal ‚Äì a false portrayal of their duty to ethically implement law. Dissent isn't misconduct, but professionalism. Removing such voices erodes integrity.
The rule ignores existing accountability (probation, PIPs, adverse actions). The issue is inconsistent use, not lack of tools. Reclassifying won't fix poor supervision, but worsen morale. Invest in manager training instead.
"Policy-influencing" is too broad, risking politicization of apolitical experts (attorneys, analysts). Removing their rights creates a loyalty test over merit. Career employees are institutional memory, not saboteurs. This rule makes expertise expendable.

   Text sample: I do not support this proposed rule. It is quite clear that this proposed rule would increase partisanship and decrease the effectiveness of the civil service.

As noted in the proposed rule, there are already clear procedures to remove ineffective or poor performing employees and clear procedures for these employees to appeal adverse actions. The claim that it is very difficult to remove poor performers or that many believe it is not possible to remove poor performers is not proof that this system is ineffective.

The claim that it is difficult to remove poor performers and an "at will" classification is needed is misleading. It is already possible to remove poor performers. This proposed rule would simply make it easier to remove employees without due process, creating a chilling effect where career employees would fear offering candid professional advice that goes against political priorities.

I want a functioning federal government with employees who are productive in their work, professional in their conduct, and accountable to the taxpayer for their performance. While poor performance and misconduct are never acceptable, there are already robust mechanisms in place to a) identify those problematic employees, b) provide them due process to defend their case if there was a mistake, and c) terminate them if the allegations are valid. Many federal agencies regularly publish internal reports explaining how many employees have been flagged for misconduct or poor performance and removed from service. There are always terminations on these reports. The system works.

In short, the new proposal is not necessary. Furthermore, this removes the civil service protections from partisanship that allow the government to function. While certain high-level executives, such as departmental secretaries and agency administrators, are political appointees for t

During the earlier years of my career the agencies were solely interested in serving the American citizens, the latter was all about management building personal empires.

By far, OCSE was the most efficient agency I ever worked for until the merger. We were told the merger would make operations more efficient/effective by combining similar functions.

The proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù would call into question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for our economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization, education statistics, and many other statistics.

This proposal introduces a framework that would enable up to a 15% pay cut for federal employees rated as ‚ÄúTier 3‚Äù performers.

I have deep concerns about the proposed regulation (OPM-2025-0004) and its potential to undermine the foundational principles of a nonpartisan federal workforce and democratic accountability. This rule would strip thousands of federal employees, those deemed to have ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù responsibilities, of their due process rights and protections under Title 5. Civil servants who have built their careers on impartiality, subject-matter expertise, and service to the public would become at-will employees, vulnerable to removal without cause or the right to appeal. This is antithetical to the merit-based foundation of the modern federal workforce.

Based on the language in the bullet points under "OPM has issued guidance about positions agencies should consider in their Schedule Policy/Career positions. These additional guideposts consist of:", the definitions are broad and could apply to a vast amount of the current career federal workforce. It opens those positions up to the potential to become "yes men" for the current administration, or be removed. This completely undermines the stability of the civil service and errodes continuity of service from administration to administration, creating waste of taxpayer dollars and decreased quality in tax-funded services.
With no ability to appeal, how are these positions protected from becoming partisan?

   Text sample: Atop House Democrat on Thursday demanded that the Office of Personnel Management rescind proposed regulations reviving Schedule F, President Trump‚Äôs plan to strip tens of thousands of federal workers of their civil service protections.

The proposed rule, published earlier this month and open for public comment until May 23, reestablishes the since-renamed Schedule Policy/Career, a new job category within the excepted service for jobs that the administration deems to be ‚Äúpolicy-related,‚Äù and outlines the process by which agencies should move to reclassify jobs within the federal government‚Äôs competitive service into the new category. Employees converted to Schedule Policy/Career would effectively become at-will employees.

OPM estimates that around 50,000 federal employees will be placed in the new job category, or around 2% of the civilian workforce.

The rule change attempts to hide the significance of this change behind the term "policy-influencing positions".

Dear Office of Personnel Management,

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed reclassification of federal employees under Schedule Policy/Career aka Schedule F. This policy represents a fundamental threat to the principles of a nonpartisan civil service and would severely harm the effectiveness and integrity of our government.

The reclassification of federal employees to "at-will" status under Schedule Policy/Career would have several deeply damaging consequences:

1.) Diminished Expertise and Continuity: By making it easier to remove experienced career civil servants, Schedule Policy/Career would drain the federal government of institutional knowledge and technical expertise. These are the people who ensure the continuity and effective functioning of government agencies, regardless of political transitions. We are already seeing the effects of unqualified individuals installed into technical positions that

There are reasons for these protections to be in place, most importantly to keep continuity within the federal government. As we see now with the recent firings and forced retirements our government has been nearly halted. As a taxpayer this was not the intention of what most Americans voted for.

   Text sample: **Introduction**  
The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 was a landmark piece of legislation designed to ensure that federal employees are hired, promoted, and retained based on merit rather than political affiliation. The proposed creation of Schedule Policy/Career is a bureaucratic maneuver that undermines this foundational principle and threatens the integrity of the federal workforce. By establishing a new employment classification outside existing merit-based protections, this policy subverts the intent of Congress and opens the door to unwarranted political influence over career civil servants.  

**Background**  
The merit-based civil service system has been a cornerstone of effective government operation since the Pendleton Act of 1883, which sought to eliminate political patronage and establish professional standards. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 reaffirmed these principles, ensuring that federal employees could serve the public without fear of politically motivated dis

   Text sample: This proposal is not subtle. It is a thinly veiled attempt to resurrect Schedule F, only with more centralized control, fewer constraints, and an even more explicit aim: loyalty to the President over loyalty to the Constitution or the public. It reads not like a serious rulemaking document but like a propaganda memo from an administration that believes the civil service exists to serve a single man rather than the American people.

The tone of this proposal is outrageous. It does not read like a neutral government document. It reads like a sycophantic love letter to the President. It talks about ‚Äúalignment‚Äù and ‚Äúvision‚Äù as if federal workers are supposed to worship the President‚Äôs agenda instead of doing their jobs for the public. That is not how our system is supposed to work and it is insulting to every honest civil servant.

   Text sample: I firmly oppose any effort to implement or reinstate the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees. This proposal endangers the merit-based civil service system that has sustained a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.

Schedule F undermines the core principles of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was designed to eliminate the spoils system and ensure federal hiring is based on merit. By reclassifying a wide range of career civil servants‚Äîespecially those involved in policy-making or analysis‚Äîas at-will employees, Schedule F would enable politically motivated hiring and firing. This runs counter to the apolitical standards set forth in 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8), which requires that employment decisions be free from political influence.

1. Introduction
I am submitting this comment as a concerned citizen deeply invested in the integrity and independence of our federal government. While I am not writing in any professional capacity, I have followed developments in civil service policy closely and feel strongly that the proposed revival of Schedule F represents a dangerous and unnecessary shift that threatens the very foundation of a nonpartisan public workforce.

This comment pertains specifically to the proposal to reestablish Schedule F‚Äîa category that would allow federal agencies to reclassify thousands of career civil service positions as ‚Äúconfidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating.‚Äù These roles would lose longstanding job protections, exposing them to at-will dismissal based on political preference rather than performance or conduct.

   Text sample: I am opposed to the proposed regulation that is enacting EO 14171 through the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career classification.  It is at odds with the plain text of Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 as well as the intent.  By moving some employees from the General Schedule to the Schedule Policy/Career and making them at-will employees means that they can be fired for any reason, no matter how minor.  This also makes them vulnerable to the whims of an administration which will undermine the non-partisan aspect of the career civil service.  5 USC ¬ß 2302 (b)(3) plainly states that employees shall not coerce political activities or take action against other employees as reprisal for the political beliefs.  At-will employment is at odds with the section of the CSRA.  In addition, 5 USC ¬ß 2301 (b)(8)(A) further reinforces this point as employees are explicitly protected against arbitrary actions, favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed rule to implement Schedule Policy/Career (formerly Schedule F), which would move thousands of career federal employees into an excepted service category that strips them of the procedural protections under chapters 43 and 75 of title 5, including the right to appeal adverse actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).

Legal and Statutory Concerns:
The rule exceeds OPM‚Äôs statutory authority by applying 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 7511(b)(2) to exclude incumbent employees from chapter 75 procedural protections when they are reclassified or involuntarily transferred. This provision clearly ties exceptions to the position, not to incumbent employees‚Äô accrued rights. The rule‚Äôs retroactive denial of fair process contradicts established precedent (Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974)) recognizing that career employees have a protected property interest in continuation of employment with due process.

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing to register my strong opposition to the proposed reimplementation of Schedule F. I am not affiliated with any political organization-I‚Äôm simply someone who believes in fair governance and the importance of a professional, nonpartisan civil service.

The Problem with Schedule F
The entire premise behind Schedule F-that federal agencies need more control over so-called ‚Äúpolicy-making‚Äù positions-sounds reasonable on the surface. But dig just a little deeper, and it becomes clear that this proposal isn‚Äôt about efficiency. It‚Äôs about control. About loyalty. About turning positions that are supposed to be held by qualified experts into revolving doors for political allies.

This is dangerous. The American government is not meant to serve the interests of any one political figure or party-it is meant to serve the people. When you start filling crucial roles

   Text sample: The government requires a qualified and professional workforce to address citizen needs and support critical infrastructure. Workers should be hired only on their capability to fill a role. As the president has made clear, DEI must not matter. By that metric, candidates should be evaluated solely on merit and nothing else. That is the purpose of separating employees on this schedule from those appointed for political reasons.

This would attempt to fix a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist. By and large, government workers who do not work are forced out per workplace policies and procedures. The government has had a longstanding policy of very long probationary periods (much longer than state governments and corporations) which allows flexibility when employees do not meet standards or are not working. To date, this has worked.

What is proposed will remove all credibility from the U.S. government and will undermine services which are essential to all Americans such as critical infrastructure,

Erosion of Merit-Based Protections

The cornerstone of the federal civil service is its commitment to merit-based hiring and retention, ensuring that employment decisions are grounded in qualifications and performance rather than political affiliation.

Public Comment on OPM-2025-0004-0001: Why Are We Rebooting the Spoils System

Let me get this straight: OPM wants to bring back a system where federal employees can be fired just for doing their jobs too well‚Äîif those jobs involve saying no to a politician. That is not modernization. That is regression. This entire proposal, Schedule Policy/Career, is the bureaucratic version of sticking a fork into a light socket and pretending it is innovative.

This proposal will make it easier for the sitting president to remove civilian service employees that have more awareness of previous changes enacted and how that affected the government office they worked in. The continuity of a civil servant is an invaluable piece of information that can benefit the government they have chosen to work for. People choose to be civil servants for the honor of serving their country. Majority of government positions are paid exponentially less than private sector counterparts.

I am strongly opposed to this proposed rule change. First, the creation of a Schedule Policy/Career directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants‚Äîparticularly those involved in policy-making or analysis‚Äîto be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.

Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule Policy/Career violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 7513, which requ

I recently learned about Executive Order 14171, and upon reading it, I believe it is likely to damage scientific progress in the US.

   Text sample: I. Introduction

This comment is submitted in strong opposition to any rulemaking or executive policy that would implement or reinstate "Schedule F" as a classification within the federal civil service. Schedule F was first introduced through Executive Order 13957, signed on October 21, 2020, and later revoked by Executive Order 14003 on January 22, 2021. The proposal to reintroduce this classification threatens the apolitical, merit-based principles that are the bedrock of the federal civil service.

II. Legal and Constitutional Concerns

A. Violation of the Merit System Principles

Schedule F contravenes the merit system principles codified in 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b), which require that "employees be selected and advanced solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills" and "protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes." By placing career civil servants into an at-will employment category based solely on a vague defini

   Comment IDs: OPM-2025-0004-3126
   Text sample: The proposed rule suffers from fundamental inconsistencies and lacks evidentiary support. While OPM claims the rule will enhance accountability by easing the removal of career employees, citing supervisors‚Äô alleged difficulties addressing underperformance, its practical effect would be to strip due process protections primarily from policy-oriented employees, not the lower-level employees purportedly "hard to fire." Notably, many reclassified positions under this rule are supervisory (e.g., GS-14/15 policy advisors), contradicting its stated goal of targeting non-performing staff. This misalignment raises questions about the rule‚Äôs true objectives.

1. Arbitrary Distinction Between Policy and Non-Policy Roles
The rule‚Äôs bifurcation of employees into "policy" and "non-policy" categories is legally and logically untenable:

2. No Empirical Basis: OPM provides no evidence that non-policy employees are inherently more responsive to supervisors or that policy roles require weaker protection

   Text sample: As a federal employee working in a scientific and technical capacity, I submit this comment to express my firm opposition to the proposed rule that would create a new ‚ÄúSchedule Career/Policy‚Äù employment category. This rule is a direct threat to the integrity of science-based governance and would severely undermine the mission-driven work carried out by public servants across federal agencies.

I entered public service because I believe that science, data, and evidence must inform policy decisions‚Äîespecially when lives, resources, and the environment are at stake. The proposed rule jeopardizes this foundation by granting political leadership sweeping power to reclassify technical experts into an at-will employment status, stripping them of civil service protections and leaving them vulnerable to political pressure or termination for doing nothing more than reporting objective facts.

   Comment IDs: OPM-2025-0004-3255
   Text sample: I strongly oppose the creation of a Schedule ‚ÄúPolicy/Career‚Äù for federal workers. This proposed regulation would decimate the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, non-partisan federal workforce for nearly 150 years. Merit-based federal employment means a more efficient government for American taxpayers and better public services for the American people. This proposed regulation would make our federal agencies less effective and expose the American public to the type of corruption that civil service laws were enacted to protect against.

The creation of Schedule ‚ÄúPolicy/Career‚Äù and the broad way in which it is being interpreted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) are contrary to Constitutional due process. It has long been recognized that non-probationary government workers are entitled to due process before they can be removed or have other employment actions taken against them. See Gilbert v.

   Text sample: I am firmly opposed to the implementation or revival of the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees. This proposal endangers the merit-based civil service system that has sustained a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for well over a century.

At its core, Schedule F stands in direct opposition to the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was designed to eliminate the patronage system and ensure that federal hiring and retention are based on competence rather than political allegiance. By enabling the reclassification‚Äîand potential at-will dismissal‚Äîof a wide range of career civil servants, especially those engaged in policy or analytical roles, Schedule F reintroduces the very partisanship the Pendleton Act sought to eradicate. Such a shift would violate the spirit of 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8), which safeguards the principle that federal employment decisions must be grounded in merit and shielded from political coercion.

The stated purpose of the new rule is to "to increase career employee accountability" (https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-06904/p-3) by making some 2% of the federal workforce subject to firing without a ‚Äúperformance-based‚Äù cause (https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2025-06904/p-33).

RE: Public Comment in Response to Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service [Docket No. OPM‚Äì2025‚Äì0004]
I am writing to express my concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions. The proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù would introduce doubt about the reliability of many useful data gathered by the federal statistical system. The federal statistical system plays an essential role in improving the lives of all Americans as well as informing critical policy decisions with evidence that is timely, relevant, accurate, and objective.  The proposed rule would allow a change from the current system of professional and objective statistical data gathering and reporting.  A more political structure for the federal statistical system would reduce the value of the data for all purposes except politicking.

At least five employee unions are now challenging these mass RIFs in court for violating the constitutional separation of powers principles and the Administrative Procedures Act.

First, I worry about how long it will take to appoint people into these positions. While the appointment of agency heads used to take on average 2 months, recently it has started to take, on average, over 150 days. That‚Äôs over 5 months! That is too long for so many positions to remain unfilled. Government organizations will not work well with so many positions left unfilled or filled with temporary appointments. I‚Äôve seen firsthand how people in these temporary appointments are scared to make decisions that may be at odds with those who may follow them. 

Second, at-will employment can undermine efficiency. For example, things such as interpersonal relationships and personal ideology begin to take on a larger role, which are irrelevant to job performance. As such, federal employees start to work harder on cultivating favor r

This regulation undermines the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA). 
This Act was enacted to prevent politicization of federal workforce. This proposed relegation does not define ‚Äúpartisanship‚Äù and allows this and future administrations the ability to terminate or discipline employees that might question policies in violation of their First Amendment rights. A result could be costly litigation. This proposed regulation also appears to be an attempt to bypass the Merit Systems Protection Board which would deprive the employees from their due process rights. 
As a retired citizen, I find this proposed regulation to be a way to eliminate good employees that serve the public good. A good employee should not have to be worrying about being randomly fired for no cause - and this proposed regulation does just that.

While accountability for misconduct or poor performance is important, this rule risks politicizing career positions, eroding due process protections, and enabling arbitrary dismissals that could harm institutional knowledge and democratic governance.  

Key Concerns with the Proposed Rule are as Follows: 

1. Erosion of Due Process & Workplace Fairness  
   The civil service system was designed to protect career employees from political coercion and arbitrary removal. By stripping adverse action procedures and appeal rights, this rule opens the door to capricious terminations, potentially targeting employees for

This proposal is wholly anti-democratic and dangerously fascist. Its text purports ‚Äú While most Federal employees nonetheless faithfully perform their jobs, some do not. As discussed in greater detail later in this proposed rulemaking, it is well documented that many career federal employees use their positions to advance their personal political or policy preferences instead of implementing the elected President's agenda. Such behavior undermines democracy, as it enables government power to be wielded without accountability to the voters or their elected representatives.‚Äù

A flat out lie. Accountability is exercised in existing reporting structures. Bosses, supervisors, namely existing hierarchy hold the duty and authority to keep their employees accountable.

This weakens our government's efficiency and effectiveness. We need nonpartisan federal workers who are there to actually do the job and not bow down before a "wanna-be" king.

I oppose the proposal to reclassify tens of thousands of career civil-service positions for several reasons:
‚Ä¢ Non-partisan expertise is indispensable. As a software engineer turned civic advocate, I rely on federal data and guidance in my daily life. If analysts and inspectors can be dismissed for political convenience, the accuracy and impartiality of that information will suffer, hampering businesses and citizens alike.
‚Ä¢ Long-term projects need continuity. My own work in tech has shown that complex systems collapse when institutional memory walks out the door. The same risk applies to everything from disaster response to veterans‚Äô services.
‚Ä¢ Public trust is fragile. After a decade living in Denver, I‚Äôve seen how distrust in government feeds polarization. Allowing mass, politically motivated firings would confirm people‚Äôs worst suspicions and make constructive problem-solving even harder.

Schedule F would enable the arbitrary reclassification of tens of thousands of nonpartisan, expert federal employees as political appointees, effectively replacing competence with loyalty as the primary criterion for employment.

I. Violation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978

   Text sample: I am writing to respectfully submit this public comment in strong opposition to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs proposed rule entitled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù (Federal Register Docket No. 2025‚Äì06904), published on April 23, 2025.

This proposal, which seeks to establish a new employment category known as ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career,‚Äù raises serious legal and constitutional concerns and threatens to undermine the integrity, stability, and merit-based foundation of the federal civil service.

1. Legal and Constitutional Concerns

The proposed rule closely mirrors the legally and publicly discredited ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù executive order issued in 2020. That order was withdrawn due to its incompatibility with the statutory framework governing the federal civil service, particularly the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which enshrines merit system principles and protects against politically motivated hiring and firing.

   Text sample: The proposed implementation of Schedule F represents a fundamental threat to the principles of good governance and the very structure of our civil service. It's not merely a bureaucratic adjustment; it's a potentially seismic shift that could destabilize the federal workforce and undermine the ability of our government to function effectively and impartially.

At the heart of the issue is the concept of the merit system, which has been a cornerstone of the federal civil service for decades. This system ensures that federal employees are hired and promoted based on their qualifications and competence, rather than their political affiliations. It fosters a professional, nonpartisan workforce dedicated to serving the public interest, regardless of which political party holds power. Schedule F would dismantle this system by reclassifying certain federal positions, making it easier to hire and fire employees based on political loyalty.

The consequences of such a change would be far-reachin

First, there is nothing wrong with the current process to remove poor performers.  It is incumbent upon management to learn how to wisely utilize the tools provided in the CFR and labor contracts to properly hold poor performers accountable   If this were the major concern, then the regulations would/should address this issue without singling out "policy-influencing" positions.

Second, it is already clear that some agency heads plans to abuse this policy.  Several positions that are not "policy-influencing" are being erroneously labeled as such in order to more easily reduce the workforce without due process.  For example, policy implementors who neither make nor influence the policies they are being asked to carry out are being erroneously placed in these at-will positions.  This is obviously inappropriate and could spell disaster for agencies who abuse this power.

This would undo more than 140 years of civil service protections that began after the ratification of the Pendleton Act of 1883.

To the Office of Personnel Management,

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule concerning the protection of the federal workforce, identified as Docket ID OPM-2025-0004 and RIN 3206-AO80.

The existing civil service protections are vital for cultivating and maintaining a skilled and experienced federal workforce. These protections are not arbitrary; they serve to ensure stability, encourage dedicated public service careers, and safeguard the institutional knowledge that is critical for effective governance. Federal employees often possess deep expertise and a long-term perspective gained from serving across multiple administrations. This historical context and understanding of how and why policies, regulations, and decisions were made are invaluable assets to their respective agencies and the government as a whole.

   Text sample: The executive order establishing schedule "policy/career", formerly known as schedule F, puts Americans' health and well-being at risk. Civil service jobs safeguarding our public health and protecting Americans financial well-being, among others, should be held by those with expertise in these fields regardless of who is in charge of the executive branch. Congress rejected political cronyism 142 years ago with the passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act requiring a merit-based system for federal employment; a system which has helped make our country into the world's greatest military and economic superpower, as well as the world's scientific research and development leader. In addition to the likely illegality of this executive order, the great majority of Americans believe in merit-based employment. In fact, the belief that hard work put into gaining education and experience in a field can lead to a bettering of your circumstances no matter what social class you were born in

I analyze data, advise on outcomes, and try‚Äîlike thousands of others‚Äîto give elected officials the clearest, most honest picture of what their policies will do. I don‚Äôt write policy. I inform it. And now, apparently, that makes me a potential target for reclassification and termination if someone decides I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo close to the policy process‚Äù or ‚Äúnot aligned with the agenda.‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt about accountability. This is about control.

   Text sample: This proposed rule's justifications are invalid. There already exist politically-appointed positions within federal agencies, to which the President is given free reign to install an appointee at will. These politically-appointed positions are empowered to oversee the implementation of Presidential priorities for their agencies. Why, in addition to these political appointments, which make up approximately 4,000 positions throughout the government, is there still a need to create a new position type which allows at-will employment and eliminates employee protections? The stated reasons include the need to remove employees within "policy-influencing" positions without the ability to appeal a removal. The merit systems protections allow employees to appeal their removal - it doesn't prevent the removal. Why is it important to remove an employee with "policy-influencing" duties without the merit systems protections? It seems important to this administration to create political appointments

First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants‚Äîparticularly those involved in policy-making or analysis‚Äîto be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing.

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions. This change will erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. The proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù would call into question the objectivity of our economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and many others.

I am writing in response to the proposed regulation concerning the restructuring of federal civil service protections. As a Human Resources professional with experience in organizational policy and employee relations, I understand the value of accountability in public employment. However, I believe this proposed rule fundamentally threatens the integrity, efficiency, and continuity of our government.

Background and Concerns
The stated intent of the proposal is to "promote a nonpartisan civil service." Ironically, this rule appears designed to do the opposite ‚Äî to give the executive branch more power to terminate employees who are not politically aligned. This undermines the very foundation of a professional, nonpartisan civil service and risks politicizing a workforce that should operate above political tides.

To the Office of Personnel Management:

The proposed rule to establish ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù is a fundamental departure from the spirit and purpose of the U.S. civil service. It is historically revisionist, legally flawed, and normatively corrosive to democratic accountability.

I. Foundational Mischaracterization of Civil Service Origins

The framing offered in OPM‚Äôs background section presents a misleading view of the historical trajectory of the federal workforce. While it is true that early federal employment was politicized, the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883 represented not a reluctant or temporary compromise, but an intentional pivot toward institutionalized merit, driven by public outrage over abuses.

Rather than reinforcing executive control, the history of civil service reform‚Äîfrom Pendleton to McKinley‚Äôs EO 101 and Roosevelt‚Äôs EO 173‚Äîdemonstrates a steady progr

I am strongly opposed to this proposed rule change. Civil service protections are in place for a reason, to ensure that we attract and retain experienced federal workers. Our civil workers have specific expertise and experience and have a sense of history, having worked for multiple administrations. This knowledge is valuable to the offices they hold and to provide context for why certain regulations, decisions, protections were carried out a certain way in the past. We have seen over the past few months haphazard cutting of staff. AI generated letters that informed probationary staff they were fired for "performance reasons" regardless of their actual performance, resulting in us firing those who's only fault was being recently hired or promoted.

I fail to see any legitimate reason for this proposed regulation. Presently, employees can be, and always have been, able to be

   Text sample: Chapter 43 of Title 5 U.S. Code was enacted as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to streamline the process for addressing poor performance. It allows agencies to take performance-based actions without requiring the same procedural rigor as misconduct-based actions under Chapter 75. It includes:

The establishment of critical performance elements and standards;

The requirement of a performance improvement plan (PIP) when deficiencies arise;

The ability to remove or demote an employee after failure to demonstrate acceptable performance during the PIP period.

Rather than dismantle Chapter 43, agencies should be supported in fully utilizing it. OPM has acknowledged in past Government Accountability Office (GAO) and MSPB reviews that federal managers underutilize Chapter 43 tools due to a lack of training, time, and resources‚Äînot because of legal barriers. Solutions include:
Mandatory supervisory training on performance management;

   Text sample: The rationale that OPM must align with a new administration's policy preferences does not override statutory requirements or eliminate the agency‚Äôs responsibility to safeguard civil service integrity. The President may set general policy for workforce management, but OPM is obligated to execute those policies within the bounds of Title 5 and existing federal law.

Merely asserting new ‚Äúoperative legal standards‚Äù under an executive order does not constitute lawful grounds for stripping due process rights. Congress‚Äînot the President‚Äîestablished the Merit System Principles, adverse action protections, and appeal rights that govern federal employment. Title 5 does not permit executive override of these frameworks by fiat.

Furthermore, OPM‚Äôs assertion that performance management challenges justify reclassifying entire categories of career staff as at-will is unsubstantiated. While concerns about poor performance are valid, the proposed solution is both overbroad and unresponsive to the act

   Text sample: OPM‚Äôs reliance on a recent FDIC audit as justification for the proposed rule is both factually incomplete and analytically flawed. While the findings of misconduct and poor management at FDIC are deeply concerning, they do not support a wholesale dismantling of due process rights for policy-influencing employees across the federal government.

First, the FDIC operates under a unique governance and oversight structure, distinct from most executive agencies. It is overseen by a multi-member board and functions in part as a quasi-independent financial regulator. Drawing broad civil service policy conclusions from this example is methodologically unsound.

Second, the audit did not conclude that existing adverse action procedures were the primary cause of the misconduct. Rather, it highlighted the lack of enforcement, the failure to follow internal policies, and managerial inaction. The problem was not overregulation‚Äîit was underenforcement.

Third, even within the FDIC, adverse action rul

   Text sample: Mischaracterization of Career Civil Servants and Misuse of Anecdotal Evidence

The proposed rule‚Äôs justification that Schedule Policy Career is necessary due to ‚Äúcareer employee resistance‚Äù relies heavily on anecdotal evidence, anonymous sourcing, and isolated incidents that lack legal or statistical rigor. This proposal not only fails to meet the standards required for administrative rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), but it also promotes a narrative that distorts the constitutional and statutory roles of the civil service.

1. Isolated Incidents Do Not Justify Systemic Overhaul

The cited examples‚Äîsuch as a single EEOC administrative judge's email or one EPA employee's public statement‚Äîare extraordinary precisely because they are rare. The APA requires that agency rulemaking be based on substantial evidence, not news reports, undercover videos, or political commentary.

   Text sample: OPM‚Äôs assertion that the terms ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù do not require specialized interpretation and can be broadly applied to justify removing adverse action protections from career employees is legally flawed and dangerously expansive. The agency‚Äôs argument‚Äîthat even if these terms are terms of art, they merely convert positions into political designations without consequence‚Äîfails to engage with the purpose and structure of Title 5.

Congress specifically designed the civil service to differentiate between political and career appointments. This distinction is fundamental to ensuring a nonpartisan professional workforce. By suggesting that a presidential declaration alone can redefine the status and protections of career employees, OPM contradicts longstanding civil service norms and statutes. Treating policy-influencing responsibilities as sufficient to nullify chapter 75 protections effectively eliminates any meaningful difference between Schedule C and Schedule Policy/Career.

I am opposed to this rule change and reclassification of positions. I am concerned that removing the protections offered our civil workers under chapter 45 and chapter 75 will allow a government to remove them at will in a situation where they may be following policy which is in opposition to executive order. Executive orders cannot contradict policy as the legislative branch is elected to make policy. In addition, stripping these protections may not allow for the most experienced people to remain; those having experience in many administrations. These protections that are proposed to be removed are specifically in place so that presidents cannot replace all workers in the government with their supporters. This could lead to the executive branch completely ignoring the policy that the people of this country have voted for in our choices of representatives and senators.

The fact that this rule even exists signals that OPM is preparing the ground for another era of loyalty-based hiring and ideologically motivated firings.

We‚Äôve already seen what happens when the political executive overreaches into civil service. During the Trump administration, career professionals‚Äîincluding inspectors general, scientists, ethics lawyers, and others in roles that have traditionally spanned administrations‚Äîwere removed or pressured out with no justification beyond political convenience. These weren

Civil service protections are in place for a reason, to ensure that we attract and retain experienced federal workers. Our civil workers have specific expertise and experience and have a sense of history, having worked for multiple administrations. This knowledge is valuable to the offices they hold and to provide context for why certain regulations, decisions, protections were carried out a certain way in the past. We have seen over the past few months haphazard cutting of staff. AI generated letters that informed probationary staff they were fired for "performance reasons" regardless of their actual performance, resulting in us firing those who's only fault was being recently hired or promoted.

Employees can already be removed for poor performance or for misconduct. They should have the right to appeal when accused. This rule change gives way too much power to the execut

The proposed rules change regarding procedures for taking action against civil servants is alarming. These changes are being proposed to make it easier to fire employees without cause and due process. Reclassifying a broad category of federal employees is a smokescreen for being able to fire employees for political reasons, not for "accountability" or "responsiveness."

Competent and responsible government work is vital for the health of our country and its citizens. Firing 50,000 federal employees will tragically wound the trust that Americans have in their federal government. The vast majority of these employees are hard working and honest, and are doing their best every day, with little acclaim and low pay. For example, people near retirement age, would like to know that workers in the Social Security Administration are experienced and qualified and able to help them navigate the

Title: Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service

I strongly oppose the implementation or revival of the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system.

As a long-serving federal employee with a strong record of performance and dedication to public service, I counter the claims made in this proposal- the removal of underperforming federal employees is possible and only poses barriers to ensure removal is fair and not based on personal bias. I offer my perspective as someone who has witnessed firsthand the critical role that effective supervision plays in driving accountability and performance in federal agencies.
I have worked under both strong and weak supervisors over the years, and the difference in outcomes is clear. Under one particularly effective supervisor, our team achieved high levels of productivity, morale, and compliance with agency goals. Imp

   Text sample: I oppose efforts to reclassify federal employees under schedule F. 

The majority of civil service positions are non-political, and employees work for the people, not a politician. In addition, many agencies are currently undergoing reductions in force, and losing vast amounts of institutional knowledge and ability. Reclassifying civil servants under schedule F makes it more likely that what knowledge remains will be lost if it suits the whims of whatever administration is in charge.  It also critically damages the ability of agencies to recruit and hire the best candidates, as job protections are being stripped.  Job protections and stability are among the most attractive features of federal employment, and as those dwindle the best candidates will look elsewhere.  Over the long term this will do incredible amounts of damage to the government‚Äôs ability to provide service, and seamless uninterrupted function as administrations come and go.

Federal employees are being made a scapegoat to allow politicians to replace competent, dedicate professionals with their own appointees. Federal employees provide stability for agencies as political leadership changes, putting them under Schedule F classification will allow for the politically motivated removal of the foundational knowledge of these agencies with each new Presidential administration.

   Text sample: This proposed regulation introduces a subtle but significant change by replacing the term "civil service" with "civil employees."  While this might appear to be a minor semantic update, it signals a troubling shift in how the federal workforce is viewed.  Words matter.  The term "civil service" reflects the duty, responsibility, and tradition of public servants who are committed to serving the American people and upholding the Constitution.  Recasting these individuals as mere "employees" risks reducing their roles to that of private-sector workers whose primary obligation is to a manager or executive - not to the public or the law.  The United States government is not a business.  Its purpose is not to generate profit or efficiency at the cost of independence or institutional stability.  It exists to serve the people, protect their rights, and promote general welfare.  Federal civil servants are not loyal to any one individual or administration.

By allowing the removal of career employees without cause, it undermines due process protections under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 7513 and the principles of the Pendleton Act. Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce, compromise expert input, and reduce government effectiveness. The Office of Personnel Management has a statutory duty under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101 et seq. to preserve an apolitical, professional civil service. I urge the administration and OPM to reject this proposal.

   Text sample: These proposals will do more harm than good. The biggest obstacle to accountability is that supervisors fail to timely document performance and/or disciplinary problems. The other issue is that supervisors fail to take action to address performance and/or disciplinary issues or stack charges on issues that span multiple performance cycles. Other factors include supervisor micromanagement of employees to a point where trust is broken beyond repair. I‚Äôve seen examples of this in a role of supervisor and as a union representative. Many times problem employees move from work unit to work unit without any accountability because supervisors failed to do their jobs. I‚Äôve represented employees where supervisors were heavy handed and the agency loses their case in arbitration because they failed to do due diligence of documentation and incremental action.

Not all employees are bad. Most are dedicated to the mission and the greater good of service to country. By implementing Schedule F or Polic

   Text sample: I am writing in my personal capacity as a United States citizen and a proud federal employee with a decade of service under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Throughout my career, I have remained committed to serving the American people‚Äînot any one president or political party. I strongly oppose the proposed rule "Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" (OPM-2025-0004-0001), which reintroduces a dangerous version of the previously rescinded Schedule F.

If enacted, this rule would severely undermine the integrity and impartiality of the civil service.

   Text sample: I oppose the proposed rule that would create a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù category.

Civil service protections were first introduced in the late nineteenth century in response to the ‚Äúspoils‚Äù system whereby supporters of government officials were appointed to political offices. The main problem with that system was that it promoted corruption and inefficiency. Several civil service reform acts have been passed over the years to ensure government positions were filled by non-partisan, competent, and qualified civil servants.

America needs a federal workforce that is professional, nonpartisan and can provide honest, evidence-based advice to policymakers without fear of political retaliation. Turning many career roles into at-will positions risks politicizing government operations and threatens the reliability of important public programs. 
Additionally, the rule states time and time again that this is not a mechanism by which federal employees can be fired for their political affiliat

   Text sample: Essentially, placing civil servants in a schedule F type position essentially politicizes what is currently a nonpartisan position. Meaning, currently civil servants perform their duties based on the needs of the American people and led by their specific expertise (e.g., scientists making decisions based on science). Turning their positions into schedule F or the like essentially places them to carry out their duties based on the whoever is currently president, which makes these positions subject to the politics of any future president, whether you like them or not. So, if an American citizen doesn‚Äôt align with a sitting presidents ideology, they will be significantly impacted by the decisions being made by civil servants working in government because their decisions must align with the president‚Äôs.

I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule creating a new Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) classification within the excepted service. I am submitting this comment in my personal capacity as a federal employee with 15 years of service. My current position involves coordination, implementation, and oversight of agency programs‚Äîwork requiring subject matter fluency, institutional knowledge, and consistent application of policy across administrations. While my duties are important, they are fundamentally operational and technical‚Äînot ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù in any meaningful or constitutional sense.

As a federal government employee, I am submitting these comments in my personal capacity. I strongly oppose the proposed changes.

When accepting my job as a federal employee, I took a vow to uphold the United States Constitution.

1. Sometimes, administrations want to do ill-advised things due to Presidents wanting to respond in political ways. In my experience, it is not possible to have frank conversations about problematic policies if people are fearful that they can be fired for flagging issues or opposing the implementation of a poorly-conceived policy.

The proposed rule is based on two main arguments: (1) it is too ‚Äútime-consuming and difficult‚Äù to terminate poorly performing employees; and (2) all staff in policy-related positions should be easier to terminate. By extension, it argues that it is not uncommon for these staffers to be poor performers. When we think broadly about policy-influencing roles, we are referring to high-level, career civil servants‚Äîindividuals with deep expertise and institutional knowledge who are essential in ensuring the effective and stable functioning of federal agencies across administrations. It is both implausible and unfounded to suggest that widespread poor performance exists among this group or that such a drastic structural change is warranted.

   Text sample: The ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees must be rejected. This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system, which is the bedrock of a competent, nonpartisan, and professional federal workforce.

Schedule F effectively undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to end the ‚Äúspoils system‚Äù and instead adopt a merit-based approach to hiring federal employees. By authorizing reclassification and potential termination for a wide swathe of career civil servants who are involved in policy-making or analysis, Schedule F clears the way for political hiring and firing. This goes against the principle of a politically neutral civil service, which is guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8). This statute requires that all federal employment choices be based on merit and should not be affected by political considerations.

Furthermore, the vague and far-reaching standards for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections outlined i

1. Introduction
The proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) titled "Improving Performance,
Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service," published in the Federal Register on April 23,
2025, attempts to reintroduce the principles of the rescinded "Schedule F" classification by creating a
new subcategory of federal positions stripped of longstanding merit-based employment protections.
The proposed rule is a controversial pivot in the modern regulatory structure of federal employment.
The stated aim of this rule is to allow greater presidential control over policy-making personnel.
However, the proposal is deeply flawed from both a legal and policy perspective. This comment critically
examines the legality inherent in the proposed rule and illustrates its potential to undermine
governmental efficiency, particularly in domains critical to national security. The proposed rule should

RE: Public Comment in Response to Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service [Docket No. OPM‚Äì2025‚Äì0004]

I am writing to express my objection to the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform such positions which rely to political ones. The proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù would call into question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for our economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and many other statistics. The federal statistical system plays an essential role in improving the lives of all Americans as well as informing critical policy decisions with evidence that is timely, relevant, and accurate. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule due to the following:

   Text sample: As a federal contractor speaking in my personal capacity, I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule OPM-2025-0004-0001. This rule seeks to rescind long-standing policy directives that underpin Executive Order 11246‚Äîpolicies that have played a vital role in preserving neutrality and fairness in federal employment. I am deeply concerned that eliminating these standards would erode one of the foundational principles of the federal workforce: political and ideological impartiality.

Neutrality is not merely a bureaucratic ideal; it is essential to the functioning of a government that serves all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, background, or identity. Federal employees are tasked with implementing laws and programs fairly and consistently. Their ability to do so depends on policies that ensure employment decisions are based on merit, not personal bias, political loyalty, or discriminatory preferences.

   Text sample: I am against the proposed rule to establish a new "Schedule Policy/Career" category.

Civil service protections were introduced in the late 19th century to combat the "spoils" system, where government officials appointed their supporters to political offices. This system led to corruption and inefficiency. Over the years, several civil service reform acts have been enacted to ensure that government positions are filled by non-partisan, competent, and qualified civil servants.

America requires a federal workforce that is professional, nonpartisan, and capable of providing honest, evidence-based advice to policymakers without fear of political retaliation. Converting many career roles into at-will positions risks politicizing government operations and undermines the reliability of essential public programs.

Moreover, the rule repeatedly claims that it is not a mechanism for firing federal employees based on their political affiliation. If that were true, this effort would not solely ta

I strongly oppose the proposed rule because President Trump‚Äôs Schedule F,
introduced via Executive Order 13957 in October 2020, represents a
reckless and dangerous assault on the integrity of the federal civil
service. This policy sought to reclassify a vast number of career federal
employees‚Äîpotentially tens of thousands‚Äîinto a new category, stripping
them of long-standing job protections and making them vulnerable to
politically motivated firings. The implications of Schedule F are not only
a threat to the merit-based system that underpins effective governance but
also a direct attack on the principles of impartiality, expertise, and
stability in public administration. Below, I outline a forceful
repudiation of Schedule F, grounded in its detrimental impact on
government functionality, democratic norms, and the public interest.

   Text sample: I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the potential reinstatement of Schedule F, a policy that poses significant legal and constitutional challenges to the integrity of the federal civil service.

Legal Concerns:

Schedule F aims to reclassify a broad segment of federal employees into positions that lack the procedural protections established under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA). This reclassification undermines the merit-based principles that have been foundational to our federal workforce for over a century. The CSRA ensures that federal employment decisions are based on merit and free from political influence, providing employees with due process rights, including notice, the opportunity to respond to adverse actions, and the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).

By circumventing these protections, Schedule F effectively returns the federal employment system to a patronage model reminiscent of the 19th-century ‚Äúspoils system,‚Äù which

If OPM ignores these comments, the rule will be ripe for vacatur under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 706(2)(A).

‚∏ª

I. Exceeds OPM's Statutory Authority
1. No Statutory Excepted-Service Schedule Exists - Title 5 creates only Schedules A, B, C, D, and SES. Neither CSRA ¬ß 3302 nor any statute authorizes a "Policy/Career" schedule.
2. CSRA's Repeal of Lloyd-La Follette Authority - The CSRA eliminated the hybrid-status regime; nothing in Title 5 permits stripping adverse-action protections while retaining "competitive status."

‚∏ª

II. Arbitrary and Capricious Definition of "Policy-Influencing"
1. Failure to Justify Broad Expansion - OPM offers only a "plain English" gloss on "confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating"

   Comment IDs: OPM-2025-0004-4959
   Text sample: The proposed rule unlawfully undermines veterans' competitive hiring advantages in federal employment, directly contravening 38 U.S.C. ¬ß 4214 and Supreme Court precedent (Department of Transportation v. Paralyzed Veterans of America, 1986). By diluting competitive service protections, the rule illegally obstructs congressionally mandated preferences for veterans‚Äîa violation that demands immediate rescission.  

 Legal Violations  

1. Violation of Veterans' Preference Laws (38 U.S.C. ¬ß 4214)  
   - Congress explicitly granted veterans hiring and retention preferences to recognize their service and sacrifice.  
   - The rule weakens competitive service safeguards, effectively diminishing veterans' statutory advantages in federal hiring, promotions, and retention.  
   - Department of Transportation v. Paralyzed Veterans (1986) reinforced that veterans‚Äô hiring rights cannot be circumvented by administrative maneuvers.  

2. Contravenes Merit System Principles (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301)

   Text sample: I am a retired Milwaukee nature center director with a MS degree and the author of several books in my field published by the University of Wisconsin Press.

One of  main concerns with this proposed rule is that it compromises federal law.  Federal law states that civil servants must be hired and promoted based on expertise not political loyalty.  The proposed rule would undermine this and make it likely that civil servants who are expert in their fields vulnerable to retribution if their expert evaluations and work are not in alignment with the views of President.

For example, my family and I are gravely concerned that the air we breathe and water we drink will not be protected if expert civil servants are eliminated for speaking out on polluters and environmental  problems..   Another fear is that our health will be affected by the elimination of civil servant experts in the CDC and other health agencies.

   Text sample: The Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed rule fails to meet the most basic requirements of reasoned rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). By refusing to identify which federal positions would be reclassified‚Äîor even provide criteria for such reclassifications‚ÄîOPM has rendered this rule arbitrary and capricious under Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass‚Äôn v. State Farm (1983). Without this fundamental information, neither Congress nor the public can provide meaningful comment, violating core principles of transparent governance. The rule must be withdrawn immediately.  

 Legal Deficiencies  

1. Arbitrary and Capricious Under State Farm  
   - The Supreme Court in State Farm held that agencies must examine relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for their actions, including a "rational connection between the facts found and the choice made."  
   - Here, OPM provides:  
      No list of affected positions

   Text sample: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has violated 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 609(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) by failing to convene a required Small Business Advocacy Review Panel before proposing this rule. Following binding precedent (National Association of Manufacturers v. EPA, D.C. Cir. 2021), this procedural defect renders the current rulemaking legally invalid. The comment period must be immediately suspended until OPM: (1) complies with its statutory obligations, and (2) provides the public with the panel's findings.  

 Legal Violations  

1. Clear Statutory Violation (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 609(b))  
   - The RFA mandates that agencies convene a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel before proposing rules that will have significant economic impacts on small entities.  
   - These panels must include representatives from:  
      OPM  
      The Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy

   Text sample: The proposed mass reclassification of federal positions would trigger billions in unlawful severance obligations in direct violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. ¬ß 1341) as interpreted by OPM v. Richmond (1990). This fiscal impropriety requires immediate intervention by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The rulemaking must be suspended until: (1) GAO completes a full audit of potential severance liabilities, and (2) OPM certifies compliance with federal appropriations law.  

 Legal Violations  

1. Anti-Deficiency Act Violation (31 U.S.C. ¬ß 1341)  
   - The Act prohibits federal agencies from making expenditures or obligations exceeding appropriated funds  
   - Mass reclassification would unlawfully trigger:  
      Severance pay under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 5595 for employees who resign rather than accept reclassified positions

   Text sample: I am a federal employee writing this comment in my personal capacity. In my role as an IT Specialist (web developer), I have occasionally been asked to contribute to the rulemaking process by ensuring that a proposed rule with a technical aspect is using correct terminology for the intended technical concepts. For example, for a rule that involves collecting data electronically, I used my expertise to draft language to accurately describe how the data collection would proceed. 

Realistically, if the proposed rule were implemented, would technologists like me still be allowed to contribute to the rule-writing process, or would supervisors keep us from contributing so we wouldn't fall under Schedule P/C? If technologists aren't included in rulemaking, this will reduce any rulemaking team's ability to express technical concepts with clarity and accuracy, which would reduce the effectiveness and enforceability of any rules they produce.

As a concerned citizen, I believe this change would severely undermine the impartiality, integrity, and professionalism of the federal workforce, which plays a critical role in ensuring that government services are provided fairly and competently.

The reclassification of thousands of career civil servants would strip away essential civil service protections, making it easier for political motivations to dictate personnel decisions. This proposal would grant undue power to political appointees to remove highly qualified federal employees without cause or due process, thereby opening the door to partisan manipulation and undermining the concept of a merit-based workforce.

   Text sample: My grandfather was a civil servant. This was in New York 75 years ago, approximately. He worked for the state's immigration office. He himself came from immigrants to the US, as so many did in that time period. They helped make this country great, as immigrants continue to do. They bring a work ethic, perseverance, and interest in being good citizens that most native-born Americans don't have. 

But my real point here is that as a civil servant, at a job he literally gave his life to (the habit of everyone smoking in the office gave him lung cancer, even though he himself never smoked, which killed him when I was young; I barely knew him), the salary and pension he received helped secure my family's financial well-being for generations.

This isn't to say he was rich. But he was able to save, and those savings helped pay for my father's college tuition, graduate school, and the down payment on his first house -- the one I was born in. That in turn helped me be able to go to college and

To the Office of Personnel Management,

I am writing to express my profound opposition to the proposed rule that seeks to reinstate principles similar to "Schedule F," which would reclassify potentially tens of thousands of career civil service positions as political appointments. This move would dangerously politicize the federal workforce, undermine the merit-based system that has been the bedrock of our civil service for generations, and severely damage the effectiveness and integrity of our government.

The rationale for our nation's professional, non-partisan civil service is clear: to ensure that the day-to-day work of the government is carried out by individuals selected for their expertise and experience, free from undue political influence or coercion. Career civil servants provide essential continuity across administrations, offer impartial advice, and

I strongly oppose the proposed Office of Personnel Management rule to reintroduce and expand Schedule F (or ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù), which would dangerously politicize the federal civil service and undermine the integrity of America‚Äôs scientific and policy-making institutions.

This rule represents a direct assault on the merit-based principles that have long guided the federal workforce.

   Text sample: I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule to create the "Schedule Policy/Career" excepted service category, which would effectively revive the discredited Schedule F approach. This rule is a fundamentally flawed and dangerous shift in civil service governance for the following reasons:

The proposed rule would strip civil service protections from tens of thousands of career federal employees, making them at-will and subject to removal without cause or recourse. This undermines the core merit system principles established by the Pendleton Act and reinforced by the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), which were designed to prevent the return of the patronage or "spoils" system and to ensure that employment decisions are based on merit, not politics.

By allowing broad reclassification of policy-related positions into at-will status, the rule opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This threatens the nonpartisan character of the civil service and risks turning fede

Politicization increases the influence of more ideologically radical appointees relative to more moderate civil servants. Politicization also reduces accountability. Bureaucrats worried about being fired fail to share uncongenial information with their political bosses and become less likely to respond to congressional oversight. As politicization begets lower transparency and administrative capacity, it increases waste and inefficiency.

   Text sample: Do not change schedule F to political appointees: it is wasteful, inefficient, and undermines the purpose of these appointees to instead act as surveillance over what kinds of research and service the US produces. Scientific research is one of the US‚Äôs strongest exports ‚Äî we have a world-renowned ecosystem of research and publication that this will frankly destroy beyond repair, reducing the US‚Äôs status in the world and driving the economy further into a tailspin.

The administration says that the purpose of Schedule F is to increase accountability for civil servants involved in policy-making. Set aside the fact that civil servants are accountable in multiple ways, Trump‚Äôs own justifications strike a more conspiratorial tone, including ‚Äúthe deep state can and must be brought to heel.‚Äù But what better way to actually institutionalize a deep state than by expanding political influence over what constitutes good science?

   Text sample: I have watched how, in the past months, competent civil servants were replaced by political appointees who brought no or very little experience to the job. I am appalled.
I am truly worried that our country will end up being led by a group of cronies whose only purpose in life is sucking up to the President in the hope of a hand-out.
We need non-partisan, independent civil servants who have earned their positions by unwavering commitment to the job and a willingness to stay with the task, no matter what the current political wind (or storm) might bring. In short, who have stood the test of time. And so far, that has worked. Only recently, these long-serving civil servants were fired left and right. And this change now gives even more power to continue this embarrassing spectacle (at least on the world stage, where we become a laughing stock).

In my understanding, the current plans are not at all about what the rule says prima facie. So far, civil servants have been mostly non-partisan

And while this administration falsely claims that this long-held structure is inefficient and lacks accountability, the data does not bear out.

   Text sample: There are existing frameworks of accountability which can be adjusted without going to the scope proposed by the new rule. Given that the pattern of removing government employees since the creation of DOGE has resulted in a large number of errors, public fights, and funding delays, the proposed rule does not inspire confidence that a careful mode of establishing accountability will be adopted. 

Consider the decisions regarding the NIH and the NSF. The individuals responsible for grant reviews were not "unaccountable" in any meaningful way, and they represented experts in their fields who applied rigorous review to every application. These actions are not in dispute when one consults the track record of the agencies and the incredible levels of transparency and accountability afforded to the public through the basic structure of the funding scheme. However, the implementation of new "accountability" and cost cutting measures at both agencies have dramatically reduced available funding

I am submitting this comment in strong opposition to the proposed rule that would establish Schedule Policy/Career (formerly Schedule F) and remove vital civil service protections from an estimated 50,000 career federal employees.

As a UX designer who has spent years collaborating with federal employees to improve government technology and build capacity within agencies to deliver better services to the American public, I have witnessed firsthand how the effectiveness of government technology initiatives depends on the stability, expertise, and nonpartisan dedication of the civil service.

The proposed rule would fundamentally undermine the capacity of government to deliver effective digital services for three primary reasons:

   Text sample: The Career Civil Service as a Democratic Check and Institutional Steward

The American public sector is composed of professionals who have served with distinction across decades and under administrations of both parties. From legal aid attorneys and caseworkers to scientific researchers, environmentalists, public health professionals, and federal civil servants, these individuals carry out the daily work of governance‚Äîimplementing policies, safeguarding public programs, and defending the constitutional rights of the public.

What distinguishes the career civil service is not partisan ideology, but institutional memory, subject-matter expertise, and a principled commitment to the rule of law. These employees learn, adapt, and compromise as policies evolve. They execute change when asked and ensure continuity when needed. In doing so, they act as one of the most critical stabilizing forces in American democracy.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed reinstatement of Schedule F, as detailed in the Federal Register notice ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù . This policy threatens to undermine the integrity, efficiency, and nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service, with far-reaching consequences for governance and public trust.

The erosions of merit based civil service protections is dangerous and frankly lazy. Performance issues in the government, similar to any large corporate entity, are very real but a well thought out policy and revision to hiring practices and performance reviews could have alleviated this. The implementation of Schedule F would reclassify a significant number of career civil servants into positions that lack traditional job protections, effectively making them at-will employees.

Since General George Washington called soldiers to serve and defeat the British, protecting and defending America has been a calling. It has taken numerous forms over the last 250 years, but the most impactful for the most citizens has been the call to public service in our federal government agencies. I was born not far from Independence Hall. The sacrifice and battles to protect and preserve this country was reiterated with every field trip we had. I grew up with a strong sense of respect and care. Public service is a continuation of those values. 

I have sat in those gatherings of recently graduated college students, people of every background who worked very hard to get to that place and were excited to build their nation and the people that lived in it.

   Text sample: I am writing in regards to the Office of Personnel Management, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, RIN 3206-AO80.

I strongly object to introducing or reviving the "Schedule F" classification for federal workers. An underlying bedrock of career, non-partisan civil servants running the day-to-day operations of our Government is the foundation of trust in the American Government. These individuals ensure the smooth functioning of the country and provide continuity and trust even as elected officials come and go. It is essential they remain career employees relatively immune the political winds of the day. This plan jeopardizes the civil service system's foundation, which hires and promotes based on merit. Notably, President Trump has supported this merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which aimed to end the spo

   Text sample: This comment is submitted in strong opposition to the proposed Schedule Policy Career rule. This rule is not grounded in meaningful reform, and its justifications are both factually weak and politically suspect. It seeks to dismantle long-standing protections for career civil servants based on a manufactured crisis and fails to demonstrate any legitimate operational need.

The United States federal civil service has served effectively for generations, carrying out the mandates of presidents from both parties‚ÄîRepublican and Democrat. Civil servants have adapted to major policy transitions, from the New Deal to the Reagan Revolution, from the Affordable Care Act to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. There is no historical precedent for a president requiring the elimination of civil service protections in order to govern.

What distinguishes this rule from past reforms is its origin: not from bipartisan consensus, not from independent commission review, but from a singular administration that has

This rule is not a neutral administrative refinement‚Äîit is a deeply flawed attempt to weaken foundational civil service protections, particularly due process rights that are guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution.

The justification provided for this rule relies heavily on vague and anecdotal claims of bureaucratic resistance, yet fails to cite a single instance where federal employees categorically blocked a lawful presidential directive. The fact remains that during the first Trump Administration, major policies were carried out across the executive branch using existing systems. Civil servants implemented significant changes in immigration, tax policy, deregulation, and foreign policy‚Äîdemonstrating that the current merit-based system is both responsive and effective.

What the proposed rule instead reflects is a desire to create a class of at-will employees, exempt from

Career civil service protections are not partisan constructs.

Indeed, during the Biden Administration, many individuals appointed under the Trump Administration continued to serve, enjoying the same statutory protections now being framed as obstacles. These protections ensured they were not removed for their past affiliations or political service, reinforcing the integrity and impartiality of the executive branch.

   Text sample: In my experience as a career federal employee for 32 years, the difference between competitively hired civil servants and political appointees was the level of knowledge and expertise. Career civil servants are dedicated to the mission of the organization, not any partisan agenda and often have deep understanding of the historical context of policies and programs, vital when evaluating changes or realignment of these activities. Understanding the "why" of a particular program implementation is critical to analyzing it's effectiveness and impacts. 

Among public and private sector employees there are a variety of motivations to perform. Some want a job they can perform adequately and has some expectation of job security, others are excited by the challenges of problem solving and the chance to excel, others are inspired to provide help and take pride in service jobs. There is no evidence that the conversion of civil servants to Schedule F would change these basic motivations or improve

As a federal employee commenting in my personal capacity and not in any way on
behalf of my agency, and as Chief Steward for the National Treasury Employees Union
Chapter 190 in Parkersburg, WV, I am writing in opposition to this proposed rule.
I have been a federal civil servant for 10 years this month and worked as a federal
contractor for 14 months prior, beginning in March of 2014. I have served my entire
tenure working in shared services providing administrative resources for dozens of
federal entities (i.e. agencies, departments, bureaus, offices, commissions, courts,
funds) as part of the non-appropriated Administrati

   Text sample: The proposed rule, titled, "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service," will not, in my opinion, do anything of the kind.  It will do just the opposite.  As the rules stand now, a civil service employee is accountable under the Constitution, and the stated authorities in the respective Department or Agency authorizing legislation.  Further, any incurred costs performing appropriate duties are funded by appropriations with language that further specifies the legislatively/statutorily authorized and directed activities.  Any redress of grievances associated with performance can be arbitrated within the agency (Special Counsel or General Counsel, or, when raised to a higher level, can be administratively adjudicated under the authority of the Merit Systems Protection Board.  That Board was created to adjudicate issues associated with performance, and was deemed necessary as a result of management abuses prevalent prior to its inception.  These protectio

   Text sample: To Whom It May Concern:

My name is Jean Junior.  I am submitting this comment to oppose the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)'s new proposed rule to reclassify 50,000 federal workers (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 / RIN 3206-AO80). Why?  Because I have seen first-hand the consequences of an eroded civil service.  I am a pediatrician working both in the United States and globally.  Last year, I was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where there are severe challenges partially due to an under-staffed and under-paid civil service.  Visa applications don't get processed for months.  Ambulances don't run, and often, don't even exist.  Parents who have walked for hours on foot with their sick children can show up to a health center with no doctor and no medicines.  Rumors of bribery and cronyism abound.  All of this contributes to a context in which I had to bear witness to multiple child deaths per week.  I don't want to see this abysmal state of affairs here in the US.

Unfortunately,

   Comment IDs: OPM-2025-0004-5530
   Text sample: I would like to express my opposition to the proposed policy concerning the increased accountability measures for career employees. This proposal raises significant concerns regarding employee rights and protections under existing laws, such as 5 U.S.C. 7511, 7512, and 7513, which detail the procedures for adverse actions against federal employees. The suggested shift toward at-will positions for certain roles undermines the merit system principles established by the Pendleton Act of 1883, which was designed to ensure that federal jobs are filled based on merit rather than political affiliation.

The proposed rulemaking, particularly under Executive Order 14171, seeks to exempt policy-influencing positions from the protections afforded by Chapter 75 of Title 5. Such a move violates long-standing legal precedents that safeguard against arbitrary removal without due process. The D.C. Circuit Court's decision in Roth v. Brownell (1954) established that employees cannot be removed from the

   Text sample: Please DO NOT enact this regulation:

This regulation would actually contribute to government inefficiency in the following ways:

1. Turning civil servants into "At-will"/Political Appointees would likely mean entire Departments/Agencies would change after each Administration change. 
a. This activity would delay governmental work after each Presidental election as new employees would need to be processed into government, which becomes longer depending on the clearance level needed. Additionally, fired employees would still need to be outprocessed after the Administration change. This activity would be cost prohibative.

b. This regulation would remove critical subject matter expertise and institutional knowledge from said Departments/ Agencies. In turn, these actions would delay services and activites that help Americans, domestically and internationally, as new folks either learn their new positions, or repeat mistakes that were resolved in earlier Administrations. Again, this would

   Text sample: This comment is submitted in strong opposition to the proposed Schedule Policy Career rule. The rule fails to justify its necessity, particularly in light of the significant workforce reshaping that has already occurred across federal agencies in recent years.

Since 2020 (and most especially since the begining of the year in 2025), many agencies have undertaken large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), reorganizations, and hiring freezes. These changes have already tested the resilience, adaptability, and integrity of the career workforce. Employees have endured delayed promotions, increased workloads, and shifting priorities with no guarantee of stability. Yet the vast majority of these civil servants remained in their roles, serving administrations of both parties, continuing to uphold the Constitution and implement policies as directed.

   Text sample: Removing process protections from civil service jobs is a dreadful idea. It will politicize positions that are and should remain based on expertise, and we have already seen during this administration how officials selected for their loyalty to the president (rather than their systemic expertise) has cost us as a country. Doing what is already done with regard to about 4,000 positions to another 50,000 positions spells disaster for the United States as cronyism will replace subject matter expertise and competence, further undermining confidence in government. But more importantly, it will make all Americans less safe as the chief characteristic for employability will be loyalty to one person in preference to any level of competence at one's job.

   Text sample: I am against reinstating Schedule F. I don't think we should have more political appointees in government, but rather, we should have fewer. 

In recent years, political appointees have shown themselves to lack core competencies for their appointed positions, leading to problems that could have been avoided by hiring experts in their field(s) and keeping them in place across multiple administrations. Multiple studies, likely cited by other comments, show that political appointees perform more poorly than regular federal employees. This performance difference comes from non-political appointees investing in long-term skill development to serve American citizens better. Political appointees have no such incentive. 

One of the most important ways of keeping our economy and society stable is for the underlying assumptions of government to not radically change based on whoever is elected. As a citizen, I should trust that the FAA will not dramatically change its operations after an electio

   Text sample: I am a former federal employee who left my job voluntarily before I was removed for not meeting performance standards. Now I am studying to earn a master's degree in public policy.

Schedule policy/career is bad policy. There are already mechanisms in place (that admittedly may need improvement to increase the government's responsiveness) to remove employees who are not performing their job duties satisfactorily. I know because I was one of those employees. I think I was treated fairly under the existing regulations.

Additionally, I think the American public is well served by having civil service protections that shield public servants from politicization. I believe one of the many things that makes America great is our wealth of dedicated and talented government employees who have decades of experience working with and under multiple administrations. These employees hold vast institutional knowledge, and without them the government would not be able to run as efficiently or effective

This proposed rule risks doing lasting harm to the trust between the federal government and the American public‚Äîparticularly veterans‚Äîby dismantling core employment protections that ensure fairness, stability, and professionalism in public service.

Public trust in government institutions is not simply a function of political messaging; it is built through dependable, ethical, and nonpartisan service. Federal employees‚Äîfrom caseworkers at the VA to budget analysts at OMB‚Äîform the operational backbone of our democracy. Their ability to carry out policy, respond to crises, and serve the American people is directly tied to whether they are treated fairly and allowed to perform their roles without fear of arbitrary removal.

This is especially true for veterans, who make up a significant portion of the federal workforce. Many veterans enter public service after fulfilling

   Text sample: Government employees already have quite a but of accountability - far more than the private sector. I worked as a government employee and had (like everybody else) annual performance reviews, constant oversight of finances to ensure I didn't have a conflict of interest or was accepting any undue payments (for example, I was once sent a $30 edible arrangement and could not eat it because it was over the limit for gifts), and the structure of the government as it is helps insulate people who do a good, effective job from being run out of their jobs anytime a wayward politician comes into office. At will employment would allow there to be complete cleaning of house every time a new party is in power. This has multiple negative impacts. First - there is specialized knowledge that comes with doing a job and doing it well. To ignore that is to ignore reality. First year employees are never as effective as somebody who was learned on the job. Often these people come in and make bad, ill infor

   Text sample: This comment is submitted in strong opposition to the proposed Schedule Policy Career rule, which seeks to reclassify civil service positions without clear congressional authorization. The U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce and Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo have now sharply curtailed agency latitude to interpret statutes without express legal grounding.

These rulings clarify that under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts‚Äînot agencies‚Äîmust determine the meaning of statutes. The Supreme Court expressly rejected the Chevron framework, which previously allowed agencies to advance interpretations of ambiguous laws with judicial deference. The Court‚Äôs majority found this delegation incompatible with the APA and reaffirmed the separation of powers doctrine: it is the judiciary‚Äôs role to say what the law is.

As a result, the burden now rests squarely on OPM to identify a clear and specific legislative mandate to support any effort to exempt federal employees from statutory protections provided under Title 5‚Äîparticularly those related to adverse action procedures. No such mandate exists in this case.

Referencing a single email sent by an EEOC administrative judge during a moment of political and institutional uncertainty cannot serve as a valid rationale for the elimination of procedural safeguards for tens of thousands of federal employees.

Despite the claim that Schedule Policy/Career employees are not required to pledge personal loyalty to the President or his policies, the provisions of the rule are so poorly defined that they can be (and likely will be) interpreted and enforced as such in practice. There are no apparent criteria to determine what is meant by injecting ‚Äúideology or partisanship into their official duties instead of carrying out the elected President's policies.‚Äù Thus, any Schedule Policy/Career employees who appropriately voice concerns about a President‚Äôs policies based entirely upon legal or scientific grounds could be subject to being ‚Äúquickly separated‚Äù if they are subjectively determined by politically motivated managers to have injected ideology or partisanship into their duties.

   Text sample: I am writing to strongly oppose any measure that would grant political appointees increased control over the employment of federal agency staff. Such a change would severely compromise the effectiveness and impartiality of our civil service.

The strength of the federal government relies on its career civil servants, who possess deep subject matter expertise and institutional knowledge. These attributes are essential for the effective functioning of government agencies. The continuity and stability they provide are especially important given the relatively short tenure of political appointees. Eroding the protections afforded to these career employees would disrupt agency operations and diminish the quality of their work.

The history of civil service reform in the United States illustrates the dangers of politicizing the federal workforce. The spoils system of the 19th century, where government jobs were distributed based on political patronage, led to widespread inefficiency and corr

   Text sample: I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that seeks to politicize the federal civil service. This rule threatens the foundational principles of merit-based hiring and nonpartisan public service that have long underpinned effective governance in the United States.

The proposed rule appears to be a step toward reinstating policies akin to the previous administration's Schedule F executive order, which aimed to reclassify a significant number of career civil servants as political appointees. Such a move would undermine the apolitical nature of the civil service, allowing for the dismissal of experienced professionals based on political considerations rather than performance or merit. 

Centralizing personnel authority within OPM, as suggested by the rule, would erode the autonomy of individual agencies and concentrate power in a manner that is susceptible to political manipulation. This centralization could lead to the

   Text sample: As a concerned citizen who values efficient and effective government, I must express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would reinstate elements of the previously abandoned "Schedule F" classification.

Converting tens of thousands of career civil servants into political appointees strikes me as a solution in search of a problem. Our merit-based civil service system was established precisely because the spoils system it replaced was notoriously inefficient and corrupt. This proposal would have us circle back to a failed approach we wisely abandoned generations ago.

The career civil service exists to provide continuity, expertise, and institutional knowledge across administrations of both parties. When we start requiring political allegiance rather than competence as a job qualification, we shouldn't be surprised when the quality of public service deteriorates accordingly.
Recent history has already demonstrated that excessive politicization of government functions leads to

As a state government employee who administers a federally funded program, it is impossible to conduct the program without thorough planning and research. And it is impossible to conduct thorough planning and research if the very foundations of the funding can be changed or removed overnight without warning. We can't promise that the funds will be there, and therefor can't be sure that any plans we make will happen. The federal government must be stable, accountable, and honest in its dealings with state governments. To have such a mercurial and chaotic landscape of uncertainty at the source of our program's funding, it weakens the work we do, and our work is vital to a well-run state government. The federal government must keep its promises and adhere to the funds and agreements it makes with states. And to do that, the federal agencies can't be run by any one person's whims. They must be r

I am submitting this comment in my personal capacity as a United States citizen and a licensed attorney who has worked in federal service for 16 years in the energy sector. I strongly oppose this proposed rule, which would create a new "Schedule F"-like category of positions exempt from long-standing civil service protections.

Throughout my federal career, I have worked across multiple administrations to help federal agencies improve the energy efficiency of their buildings.

   Text sample: I write in strong opposition to the proposed reinstatement of Schedule F. I write as a career-long senior research scientist, a PhD, and a concerned citizen. I am well aware of the civil service merit principles (U.S. Code ¬ß 2301 - Merit system principles) which require that career employees should be hired on the basis of their qualifications, retained on the basis of performance, and protected against political coercion. The US already reserves the top layers of organizational leadership for short-term political appointees. Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees and emoving job protections, the basic constraint against political interference.
The administration says that the purpose of Schedule F is to increase accountability for civil servants involved in policy-making.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose OPM's proposal to establish Schedule Policy/Career. It would fundamentally damage U.S. science, research, governance, economic growth, and accountability. The changes would strip job protections from thousands of federal employees, politicize critical work, and undermine America's global leadership.


The proposed rule specifically targets positions involved in grant funding decisions. Section 213.3501 creates Schedule Policy/Career for "career positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character." The rule codifies that federal grantmaking is considered policy-making.

It threatens the merit-based evaluation of research grants underlying American scientific leadership. Agencies like NIH and NSF depend on career program officers evaluating research based solely on scientific merit, not political considerations. Removing job protections from these positions undermines the integrity of federal funding.

Part of what makes these services good is that they are provided to all, regardless of whom we voted for, and they are provided by qualified, experienced, and in many cases highly educated, public servants who are dedicated to the public good. They go through rigorous non-discriminatory hiring processes based on merit and qualifications, not based on their loyalty to a specific political party. This is directly related to the relatively low levels of corruption and high levels of service that they provide.

Schedule F would politicize the federal workforce by stripping civil service protections from thousands of dedicated public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These roles are essential to the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service‚Äînot political ideology.

Since January 2025 alone, the Refuge System has lost more than 20% of its remaining staff, compounding a 30% decline over the past 15 years. Nearly 10% of refuges are already completely unstaffed, and no refuge in the country currently has the resources it needs to operate fully. Implementing Schedule F now would devastate what remains of the conservation workforce.

   Text sample: The emergence of a modern nonpartisan civil service has been absolutely crucial to the maintenance of a high functioning and non-authoritarian government in the modern context. We live in a gigantic, mass, interdependent society; it is complex, regardless of how much we wish it were simple. Its complexity is what gives us highways, airplanes, cheap food, the internet...on and on. But it needs managing. The idea that it can function without public servants and experts is a childish wish. The two main reasons to keep our government nonpartisan is: Truth, as in scientific truth, is not partisan. A genuine expert does not think like a Dem or a Repub. They think like a researcher, i.e., someone beholden only to the truth. Scientists, social scientists, researchers, experts of every stripe, as well as those who hire and manage them on the public's behalf, should not ever be forced to think like a political hack.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would reclassify tens of thousands of career federal employees as political appointees. This policy would undermine the core merit-based principles of the civil service, increase administrative burdens on agencies, and significantly harm the effectiveness, transparency, and equity of federal programs.

The proposed rule undermines good governance.
Research consistently shows that politicizing the civil service lowers organizational performance, reduces employee investment, and creates instability. As Hertel-Fernandez, Mertens, and Carpenter (2023) found in their study published in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, politicization of the public sector erodes capacity, especially among frontline staff tasked with complex implementation.

Whims are not leadership, and superiority and hate are not American virtues; rather, these are the means by which the weak scapegoat the strong, and only the weak believe that their strength is validated by harming those without means.

The proposed rules change regarding procedures for taking action against civil servants will undermine federal services and democracy. These changes are being proposed to make it easier to fire employees without cause and due process. Reclassifying a broad category of federal employees is a smokescreen for being able to fire employees for political reasons, not for "accountability" or "responsiveness." This is a baldly political gambit to gain more power for the current administration. For evidence of this, just look at Project 2025.

Competent and responsible government work is vital for the health of our country and its citizens.

The vast majority of these employees are hard working and honest, and are doing their best every day, with little acclaim and low pay. For exa

However, existing protections for federal workers so far have not prevented the removal of 120,000+ federal workers in the first 3 months of the current Administration.

How do I know this?  I retired in December 2022 after 20 years at the US Department of Labor (DOL) in its Performance Management Center, where I led development of their quadrennial Strategic Plans and Annual Performance Reports.  Before joining DOL, I created a Performance Report Scorecard for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University (GMU) and assessed annual reports of the 24 CFO Act agencies.  I completed my PhD in Economics at GMU in 2009 after defending my dissertation, "Control and Coordination in Federal Administration," which was published by Routledge as The Political Economy of Bureaucracy in 2011.

I moved to VA in 1999 to join Mercatus' Government Accountability Project, which was formed with the exactly the goal of this rule and sought to assist implementation and oversight of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA).  The first reports, for FY 1999, were underwhelm

   Text sample: I oppose this rule change.

The Civil Service Act was created to stop the abuse of government as a way to reward donors, or pay off mistresses and boyfriends, at the expense of taxpayers.  What is offered a rule change to revert the government to a patronage system in which sucking up  to a powerful person is the most important part of the job, much as at a current cabinet meeting.

It's shameful, actually, to see this being proposed as a way to "improve" performance, accountability, and responsiveness, when every time the government fails it's generally thanks to a political appointee.

When President W. Bush said "Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job," he was praising a political appointee who oversaw the failure of government response to hurricane Katrina.

This is what the proposed rule would bring more deeply into American governance, and it's a pure power grab by those who evidence no shame in their profiteering from their own government service.  

The proposed rule is not how

I am interested in this regulation as a constituent who values a functioning, transparent, and trustworthy government. This rule, previously known as Schedule F, will make it easier to remove federal employees who are perceived as being disloyal to the Mr. Trump by re-classifying them as "at-will" employees.

Dear Office of Personnel Management:

I am submitting this comment in my personal capacity as a United States citizen and an attorney with over six years of experience working directly with Tribal Nations, specializing in federal Indian law and tribal law. I write to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule entitled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.‚Äù

I strongly oppose this measure, which claims to make it easier to remove poorly-performing federal employees, but really seeks to remove employees more easily simply based on partisan preference. There are a small percentage of employees that may not be working up to par and who are difficult to remove procedurally, but that number is minuscule compared to the number of talented and qualified people that the Administration has already fired and who they continue to seek to remove solely for political reasons.

It would be contrary to the due process afforded civilian federal employees who have a vested property interest in their jobs, having completed their required probationary periods, to deprive said employees of their ability to contest an adverse action taken against them.  The Merit Systems Protection Board has specifically held that employees have a right to a jurisdictional hearing to determine whether they were placed on notice, before accepting their position, that a determination had been made by the agency that the position was of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.  If the employee has not been placed on such notice before taking the job, then it would constitute a denial of the employee's due process for the Ag

   Text sample: I oppose this proposal. The OPM proposes this rule to increase employee accountability--suggesting there is an ongoing problem of employee misconduct and poor performance. This, in plain language, is meant to suggest that because employees are not doing what they're supposed to, the departments that they work for are also underperforming. Therefore, the OPM goes on to imply, the solution is to institute a new process to remove these underperformers quickly so that they can be replaced by other, better workers. This might be a reasonable suggestion if the reality of previous mass firings under the current presidential administration bore this theory out.

It doesn't. Efficiency in termination of government employees has not increased department productivity. The ongoing expulsion of civil servants from long-held positions has already had immediate ramifications in the past three months--evidenced by the sheer number of people who have been fired and swiftly rehired.

These shortsighted changes will only further erode the American people's already fragile trust in their government, a trust that has taken decades to build, and as history has shown, can be shattered in an instant.

Federal employees are public servants who've committed their careers to working for an institution as large and diverse as the very population it serves!

Once these employees are terminated, Trump will then reward his followers by giving them federal jobs even though these loyalists may have little or no experience or questionable ability. The appointment of Pete Hegseth as the Secretary of Defense is a perfect example of Trump rewarding a supporter with an extremely important position in spite of Hegseth‚Äôs personal issues and lack of relevant experience at this level of responsibility.

The proposal would greatly expand the number of political appointees into positions that have since the 19th century been staffed under civil service regulations designed to award merit and qualifications, not political loyalty or ideology.  

The current administration has made a great show of opposing DEI principles in favor of merit.  That this stance is a sham is evidenced by the appointments of Hegseth, Gabbard, Patel, RFK Jr. and the like -- none of whom are even remotely qualified for the jobs they now hold.  This suggests that the administration's ideas about merit are, well, not meritorious.  They reward political fealty, ideological rigidity, and plain incompetence.

Meritless "adverse actions" should NOT result in removals, suspensions, or reductions in pay or grade. The existing system works. 

This proposed rule purports to solve a problem that does not exist while simultaneously granting power to an administration that has expressed the desire to put this valued federal service "in trauma" (see attached). 

The rule should not be finalized.

The proposed rule would create a chilling effect on federal employees. The rule summary states that the intended purpose of this rule includes to "remove employees from critical positions who [...] intentionally subvert Presidential directives". Or, in other words, whose fulfillment of their job duties in furtherance of their agency's statutory mandate conflicts with the policy preferences of whoever is currently President.

The proposed rule affects federal employees classified as nonpartisan "career" employees. However, if employees can be removed for upholding the law when the law is inconvenient for the President's political preferences, then this proposed rule would completely abolish the idea of either nonpartisan positions or career federal employees. This proposed rule is incompatible with nonpartisan federal employment. This proposed rule would, in effect if not necessa

   Text sample: I would like to submit a comment in opposition to the proposed rule. One of the things that makes our country strong is that the backbone of civil servants who perform duties necessary to the public welfare are not easily removable when the government changes hands. We once had a system where government employees turned over every time a new administration was voted into office. It was called patronage, and it delivered a uniformly low level of government service as well as massive opportunities for political and financial corruption. There is a reason that the patronage system began to be reformed all the way back under President Arthur, when he signed the Pendleton Act of 1883. I don't see why we should backslide to a 19th century understanding of government employment. We need an institutionally knowledgable, nonpartisan, professional government workforce more beholden to the needs of American citizens than to the policy choices of politicians. For those reasons, I strongly oppose t

   Text sample: I write in strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs proposal to create Schedule Policy/Career (P/C), a new category of excepted service that strips civil service protections from potentially tens of thousands of federal employees. The proposed rule revives the worst aspects of the 19th-century spoils system, undermines the merit-based civil service, and risks politicizing vital government functions.

1. Problems with the Proposal

The proposed rule removes adverse action protections under Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5, U.S. Code, effectively eliminating due process for affected employees. Federal workers reclassified into P/C would become at-will employees, unable to appeal discipline or removal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), regardless of tenure or performance history (see proposed amendments to 5 CFR parts 752 and 432).

Further, the President would have sole authority to designate positions as Schedule P/C, removing any meaningful check on reclassific

Schedule F would improve the federal workforce by by making thousands of public servants, including refuge managers, scientists, and conservation professionals in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service accountable, transparent and hopefully responsible . These roles demand correction, updating and reform to continue  the functioning of the National Wildlife Refuge System and are grounded in science, law, and public service‚Äînot bureaucratic tradition.

I am a former career Federal employee in the US Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights. I started my Federal career in September 1979, under the Carter Administration.  For the next 42 years, I worked, mostly in senior management positions, under the Reagan, Bush Sr Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, and the Biden Administrations.  Without exception, the political leaders of each of these newly elected Administrations, both Republican and Democratic, were consistently skeptical and mistrustful of career staff when they first started in their new positions.  But they soon learned that career staff, rather than being obstacles to their new initiatives and priorities, were highly skilled and professional with a wealth of knowledge and expertise that could be relied on.  This is not to say that career staff did not on occasion voice disagreements or share concerns about potential pitfalls or legal ramifications that could arise.

The federal civil service needs to be able to do their jobs outside of undue political influence and remain across administrations where they can build the long-term expertise and experience to effectively do their job. Especially in these times of hyper-partisanship, the idea that huge swathes of the civil service will turn over with changes in the presidential administration will result in a merry go round of workers entering and exiting the service, never building the required expertise and constantly changing direction to the detriment of the American people. Changes in leadership as deemed necessary by the administration are more than sufficient to carry out the congressional requirements and executive direction for policies and management of federal agencies.

I am writing in opposition to the new policy that will remove civil-service protections from a new category of federal employees called ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career" (P/C).  P/C employees will then become at-will workers, and they will lose their right to challenge terminations or appeal reclassification to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).

As a former State government worker, I can say that this policy would create a sharp increase in the politicization of the government workforce, and would damage the integrity and effectiveness of the civil service.  I worked as an auditor, and our work was grounded in accounting guidance and procedures - which applied no matter what our political affiliation was.  The ability to carry out our work depended on being nonpartisan.  The government valued our expertise, and protected us from political pressures.

As a veteran, a lifelong public servant, and someone who believes deeply in the principles of limited government, accountability, and the Constitution, I must voice my firm opposition to any effort to resurrect Schedule F‚Äîwhether under the name ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù or any other rebranding.

I understand and respect the desire for efficiency and responsiveness in our federal agencies. However, undermining the merit-based civil service system in favor of political loyalty is not the way to achieve it. Schedule F, at its core, is not about reform‚Äîit is about control. It would strip thousands of dedicated civil servants of due process protections, enabling mass removals based on political considerations rather than performance or misconduct.

That is not constitutional conservatism. That is bureaucracy by loyalty test‚Äîsomething our Founders explicitly sought to avoid.

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the proposal to reintroduce Schedule F and politicize the federal civil service. This plan presents serious risks to the integrity, efficiency, and trustworthiness of our government for the following reasons:

1. It Undermines a Merit-Based System.
The U.S. civil service was established to ensure that positions are filled based on qualifications and merit‚Äînot political loyalty. Reclassifying tens of thousands of career federal employees as ‚Äúat-will‚Äù under Schedule F threatens to dismantle these essential protections, enabling the dismissal of skilled professionals solely for political reasons.

2. It Jeopardizes Government Continuity and Expertise.
Our nation depends on experienced, nonpartisan civil servants to provide continuity and institutional knowledge across administrations. Politicizing these roles risks losing invaluable expertise, which would lead to disruptions in critical government operations.

Accountability is achieved through careful selection of managers who are committed to mission delivery AND have the skills and motivation to work with their teams through challenges in delivery. The proposed rule MUST include augmentation of manager training opportunities and strengthening internal controls in a way that will make it easier to communicate successes, challenges, risks, and failures, and clear pathways to mitigating mission impact and dealing out consequences to those responsible for the problem.

Regarding the Proposed Rule titled Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service, I am deeply concerned at the loss of experienced and dedicated personnel in key roles in government that could affect the stability of essential programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the like. These services are integral to our health, and I fear that disruptions in staffing will affect the stability of their essential functions and could cost lives and waste our tax dollars in the long run. 
Having a workforce that is fearful of losing their jobs when there are changes in leadership will dissuade some talented individuals to avoid civil service altogether. Dedication, intelligence, and experience are non-partisan and we should welcome any all people who want to serve the American public.

While I agree that we need to remove employees for poor performance, this proposed rule goes too far in removing employees who have the expertise to do certain critical jobs that the American people need done.  The examples I know best are in the area of deciding which science and technology grants to fund. It is essential for our economy and national security that American science and technology is second to none.  For the past decades this has been enabled by investment by the American people through agencies such as the National Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA, NIH and others.  A critical factor in the success of American science and technology is that the program officers and directors overseeing these programs have scientific and engineering expertise.   As a scientist myself for over 20 years, I have been observing program officers and directors operate.  The current syste

   Text sample: As the wife of a career federal employee I oppose this rule. I am concerned about what it would mean if people dedicated to their particular field of work for the government, often because of their specific education and experiences, are replaced with people simply because they align politically with the administration. This does not bode well for highly important research, continuity of that research, and job security. Culture of the workplace is critical as well to retention. If workers do not feel they are valued or have rights to challenge termination or reclassification this will lead to less loyalty in the long run.

The current Administration wants to revert to the Spoils system, which we abandoned in the 1870's.  That is nearly 150 years ago.  We instituted a fair system of hiring the best qualified individuals regardless of their political affiliation.  The current Administration wants to eliminate that system and replace it with an antiquated system of appointing "loyal" workers into our federal workforce.  In the meantime, they want to eliminate the protections afforded under the current system.  All of this strikes me as unfair, backwards, and subject to political influence.  We can't continue to dismantle our government and make it less efficient, more likely to be politically influenced and less likely to be populated with workers who are experts in their jobs.

Most Federal Employees should be Civil Servants, not political appointees.  This is essential for the smooth running of the country, because we need to keep the people with expertise and experience on the job, especially when the leadership at the top is in temporary flux at the change of administrations. In my field, medicine, it works to have doctors not be on duty 24/7 because nursing (and other) personnel don't change at the same time as the doctors do.  They know the nuances - about the patients, about the care - that are essential to smooth functioning of the hospital.  There are ways to fire them or reprimand them if they are not doing their jobs, but not being part of the incoming doctor group is not a good reason to abandon their expertise. 
It is also important to attract the most talented and dedicated people to government service and having some expectation of keeping one's job over se

   Text sample: This is an inherently bad rule and should not be implemented.  

First, it‚Äôs violates the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) enacted by Congress in 1978.  

The CSRA provides that an agency may only fire, demote, or issue a lengthy suspension to an employee ‚Äúfor cause,‚Äù not for arbitrary or improper reasons. And it must first provide notice of its reasons and an opportunity for the employee to respond. The employee may then appeal the action to a neutral federal adjudicator, the Merit Systems Protection Board. If the Board rules against her, she may go to federal court.

The CSRA does carve out employees ‚Äúwhose position[s] ha[ve] been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.‚Äù   But this carve out has historically applied only to a small group of employees: political appointees.

   Text sample: Fellow Citizens,
Patronage is when politicians use their power to appoint people to serve in jobs.  This is the opposite of hiring a qualified applicant.  It is similar to when the boss gives his unqualified cousin the job and everyone else suffers because the cousin can't be fired for incompetence.  This is a form of corruption.  It is a form of trading favors.  This used to be fairly common in the 19th century - look up the stories of Boss Tweed, which our American history books recount as a cautionary tale of the damage patronage can cause.  

Surely some perks of office should be allowed, you say?  Yes!  We already have that!  Many well paying government jobs are always filled by people who are "chosen" as opposed to "hired."  A person can be chosen regardless of whether or not they are qualified to do the job -- and they get paid regardless of the quality of their work, or whether they do any work at all.

A politically neutral and independent civil service means that

   Text sample: Argument Against Expanding Schedule F:

1. It Threatens Civil Service Neutrality and Undermines Democracy

The U.S. civil service was deliberately designed to be nonpartisan and professional, especially after the Pendleton Act of 1883, which ended the spoils system.

Schedule F would allow mass reclassification of career employees into an ‚Äúat-will‚Äù category, meaning:
	‚Ä¢	They could be hired and fired for political reasons
	‚Ä¢	Their loyalty to the Constitution and public interest could be overridden by loyalty to a political leader

That opens the door to politicizing the bureaucracy, which threatens the stability and credibility of federal agencies.

2. It Would Create a ‚ÄúChilling Effect‚Äù on Whistleblowers and Independent Experts

employees from political firings‚Åπ¬π‚Å∞¬π¬π. It initially covered only about 10 percent of federal jobs but

   Text sample: As a citizen of the United States writing in my personal capacity‚Äîand as a former federal employee‚ÄîI write to strongly oppose the proposed rule to create the ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù classification and to exempt these positions from standard civil service protections under Chapters 43 and 75 of Title 5.

1. Civil Servants Must Remain Nonpartisan and Protected from Political Retaliation
The rule claims that Schedule Policy/Career positions will remain career and ‚Äúnonpartisan‚Äù (Federal Register, p. 17182), yet in the same breath it allows these employees to be fired at-will by political leadership, without the adverse action protections enshrined in law for decades. It is contradictory to claim these roles will remain apolitical while eliminating the very safeguards that insulate them from partisan pressure.

Stripping policy-influencing employees of Chapter 43 and 75 protections (pp. 17182‚Äì17183) opens the door to politicizing the civil service. The justification that some civil servant

   Text sample: Under current law, the President is responsible for appointing nearly 4,000 positions across the federal government. This system, established under statutes such as the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011 (PAESSA) and shaped by judicial precedents, already imposes a significant nomination burden on the Executive Branch. Expanding this number to 50,000 positions would introduce severe operational and accountability challenges.

At present, the President must nominate an average of three individuals per day to fill existing vacancies. Increasing this workload by more than tenfold would make it practically impossible to ensure that each nominee undergoes the necessary vetting to confirm their qualifications, as required under 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 3301 (merit system principles) and relevant case law (NLRB v.

   Text sample: We have a lot of evidence of what happens when civil servants can be hired or fired based on decisions by political appointees: regardless of whether the positions themselves are supposed to be nonpartisan/apolitical, those positions become political patronage positions, and it is the citizens who those civil servants are supposed to serve who suffer. 

For example, political appointees may tolerate subpar performance -- or even complete no-shows -- by employees who are politically connected, perhaps spending their time engaged in overt political activity on behalf of the president, or simply having personal ties to the president, his family or friends, that mean they are protected from criticism.

Government agencies exist for the benefit of U.S. citizens, like me. My taxes help to support them, and the programs and knowledge these agencies develop benefit me and millions of other Americans. Government agencies are staffed by highly educated, nonpolitical professionals who bring expertise and dedication to their work. When administrations change, career civil servants maintain the stability of day-to-day operations, while continuing to further their agencies' goals, often with bipartisan backing from Congress. For decades, government agencies have attracted and been staffed by some the brightest minds in America -- these dedicated employees have helped to build America's economy, further our knowledge, and make America a leader internationally.

This shift threatens the apolitical foundation of the civil service, which is essential in a multiparty democracy. Career civil servants often serve across multiple administrations, and their impartiality is critical to the continuity and effectiveness of government operations. If political alignment becomes a condition of employment, many highly qualified individuals will leave‚Äîor avoid entering‚Äîpublic service altogether.

   Text sample: I came to this country more than two decades ago from a place where the government pretended to serve the people, but in truth only served itself. I was born in a country where who you knew mattered more than what you knew‚Äîwhere family connections, personal loyalty, and political obedience determined whether you got a job, kept your job, or had any rights at all.

I became a U.S. citizen by choice because I believed in something better. I believed in a government of laws, not men. I believed in institutions that are accountable to the people, not to one leader. And I believed in the importance of a professional, nonpartisan civil service‚Äîwhere individuals are hired based on merit and can speak the truth without fear.

That is why this proposed ‚ÄúSchedule Career/Policy‚Äù rule horrifies me. I have lived through what happens when loyalty becomes more important than law. I have seen good, competent people fired, silenced, or exiled because they refused to play along with corruption or cover

‚Ä¢	Why then, does this OPM rule seek to move significant numbers of Federal employees to Schedule Policy/Career, essentially answering a question nobody asked?  The OPM document, Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service, justifies this effort based on several surveys (2016 Merit Principles Survey, unnamed FEVS).  For example, OPM asserts that, ‚ÄúThe MSPB‚Äôs 2016 Merit Principles Survey shows that less than a quarter of Federal employees believe their ‚Äò‚Äòorganization addresses poor performers effectively‚Äô‚Äô without also noting that the 2016 MPS was sent to 114,000 out of over 2.7 million Federal employees, and that the response rate was just 39.1%.  FEVS response rates likewise hover around the high 30s, which means that OPM is suggesting significant changes t

I understand that the Trump Administration has issued a new policy that would make it easy to fire hundreds of thousands of federal employees and replace them with political loyalists. 

As a government contractor who works in medical research, and as someone who's already lost funding and months of wages due to the mass firings and funding cuts that support Veterans health and public health research, I'm appalled that this is even being considered. My work is grounded in evidence, guided by public health priorities, and intended to serve everyone‚Äîregardless of political affiliation. The ability to carry out this mission depends on a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service that values expertise and insulates scientific integrity from political pressures.

On a personal level, this policy would make it difficult or impossible for my friends and collogues to continue working under DOD or NIH funded programs. Most of these people, includi

Like a lot of people, I didn't really think about how many vital services and functions were run by federal employees, because I took their steady, competent work for granted. In the last few months, seeing civil servant roles threatened and cut across the board, and jeopardizing key functions of normal life (getting returns on the money we paid into social security, taking care of our most vulnerable citizens, or getting help from an unbiased 3rd party in fraud cases), has highlighted how important they are.

One thing that made me realize how bad even the threat of instability was was earlier this year when I watched a friend, a civilian nurse whose patients work in the armed forces, job hunting because she has kids and she needed to find a job she could trust would be safe. Not only was that a

   Text sample: Rhetoric aside, the federal civil service is not bloated. 2 million people serve a population of 340 million people across the federal government providing multiple services and functions to a given individual across agencies. All Americans rely on these civil servants and that they don‚Äôt think about them most of the time‚Äîother than when, as here, an administration seeks the power to destroy their livelihoods for the sake of pursuing political agendas‚Äîis a credit to their efficiency and competence. It is not easy to obtain a position as a career civil servant. The application process is grueling and hiring is competitive. While one must demonstrate competitive merit to obtain career federal employment, such jobs universally pay less than similarly situated positions in the private sector. A competitive and meritorious candidate who excepts such a position is making a trade off‚Äîlower pay in exchange for job security (provided their performance meets expectations) and to serve the public

At the very least, clarification over ‚Äúdiscretion‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscretionary‚Äù should be clarified and mapped to different grant-making approaches. For example, HHS grant policy uses Objective Review Panels to score grant applications, and participation in ORPs is largely an ‚Äúother duty as assigned.‚Äù NOFOs also largely take direction from other places (laws, policies, directives, etc) in terms of language and specifics, and subject-matter experts may review or offer technical input. These actions could be considered discretionary, but they do not fit the intent behind this new Scheudle. Without better language, far too many positions will meet the criteria for inclusion.

Also, rather than focus on hiring/firing, most of the reasons for creating this new Scheudle could be accomplished by expediting transfers in/out these positions. This allows

The proposed rule lets policy-influencing positions be moved into Schedule Policy/Career (aka Schedule F). This greatly lowers the independence of career employees and makes their advice and recommendations to be influenced by politics rather than independent assessments of how best to improve protections and assistance to the majority of the American population. There are already checks in performance reviews by supervisors and Congress. At-will employees are under the threat of losing their pensions and health care, which will greatly increase hesitation to provide Congress with independent evaluations of regulations and may result in weakening Congress‚Äôs independence in funding agencies and programs.

Dear Office of Personnel Management,

As a business owner and people leader in California, I strongly oppose the proposed rule (Docket No. OPM-2025-0004) that would create a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù classification within the federal workforce.

Reclassifying federal employees to "Schedule F" or "Schedule Policy/Career" poses significant risks to the effectiveness and integrity of the federal government. This reclassification would undermine the expertise within the federal workforce, degrade the quality of public services, and erode the meritocratic principles that are foundational to good governance.

The reclassification would degrade expertise in the federal government. Federal employees are often hired based on their specialized knowledge and experience in their respective fields. By reclassifying these positions, there is a risk of replacing seasoned professionals with individuals who may lack the necessary expertise. This could lead to a loss of institutional knowledge and a decline in the quality of decision-making within federal agencies.

This rule wastes tax dollars:

When these employees underperform, it is the government's responsibility to work with them to remedy the issue. Turnover is costly, and the government and managers must reduce turnover to be good stewards of taxpayer money. This rule will do the opposite by increasing turnover and making mass firings easier with the change of the administration's political party.

   Text sample: The proposed rule change, Schedule F, would catastrophically undermine the mission of the Personnel Management Office, by effectively turning all policy-influencing positions into partisan appointments. The mechanism for this transformation lies in subjecting employees who "subvert Presidential directives" to termination without due procedure to determine whether the termination was for a lawful and valid reason. In essence, the true purpose of the proposal is to allow the President to dismiss federal employees deemed disloyal on spurious pretenses.

The proposal describes itself as "democratic," but nothing could be further from the truth: American democracy is predicated on checks and balances, so that no elected official can exceed their authority, nor act without the possibility of accountability. An independent civil service is a necessary element of the system of checks and balances. To undermine that independence is to take a large, deliberate step towards autocracy.

   Text sample: I oppose the proposal to increase the number of federal workers who are political appointees. 

Agencies have congressional mandates and long-term missions that require steady, consistent, and persistent staff to carry out those purposes and missions.  Increasing those that are politically appointed and/or may be more readily subject to reassignment/termination disrupts delivery on those long term missions, and increases inefficiencies.

As a federal employee, I have been in the business of pursuing many goals, with one week week, to fifty year, time horizons. I have sometimes carried the torch of those longer term projects, which were started by those before me, and have continued since I left those positions. And the continued pursuit of those goals requires steady hands, and the ability to speak honestly to those above without fear that you might lose your job.  It is a feature, not a bug, that federal employment carries a level of stability that empowers one to pursue long term goa

   Text sample: Comment on OPM-2025-0004: Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service

I am writing as a concerned citizen deeply alarmed by the proposed rule OPM-2025-0004. This rule threatens the foundational principles of a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce by enabling broad reclassification of civil servants into a new ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù category‚Äîstripping them of due process, appeal rights, and whistleblower protections.

The stated aim‚Äîimproving accountability‚Äîis misleading. The true impact would be a shift toward political loyalty tests in public employment, bypassing laws that protect merit-based hiring and firing. This proposal revives the worst elements of the defunct Schedule F and contradicts long-standing law and precedent.

1. Background & Legal Context
The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 was enacted to end the spoils system, establishing a federal workforce based on merit rather than political loyalty. The proposed rule under

   Text sample: I strongly oppose this proposed rule. While its stated purpose is to enhance accountability and enable the removal of underperforming or subversive personnel, its structure introduces serious legal and constitutional concerns. Specifically, the rule prioritizes adherence to Presidential directives without providing safeguards for situations in which those directives may conflict with statutory law or Supreme Court precedent.

Federal employees are sworn to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United States - not to serve at the pleasure of any particular President. Yet this proposed rule frames accountability almost exclusively in terms of alignment with the President's agenda. It uses language such as "subverting Presidential directives," but is silent on the responsibility of employees to follow the law, even when doing so may appear to contradict Executive direction.

A timely and deeply concerning example illustrates this point. On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an

Regarding the proposed change regarding the policy cited above (OMP 2025-0004, RIN 3206-A0800).   I am a citizen of the United States, and I reside in Minnesota.  I am also a former VA employee.  Before I retired from the VA, I worked in the Spinal Cord Injury Clinic as a nurse practitioner.   Much of the good that is done in the VA is the result of individuals who develop the expertise to work effectively and dutifully within the VA system.  One thing that I remember about my experience working at the VA was the sense of everyone working together for the good of the veteran.  This was considered a sacred obligation.   

 

The current VA system is merit-based.  Rising in classification involves a concerted effort to improve the circumstances for the veteran.  Like everything else in the VA system, this needs to be meticulously documented.  It is also reviewed and signed off by the supervisor.   If employees become at-will e

   Text sample: I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù (Document Number 2025-06904).

Legal Concerns:
	1.	Contravention of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA): The CSRA established a merit-based system designed to protect federal employees from arbitrary actions and political coercion. By allowing for the reclassification of positions into Schedule F, thereby removing established civil service protections, the proposed rule undermines the intent of the CSRA and disrupts the balance of power between the executive branch and Congress.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose any effort to reinstate Schedule F in the federal workforce. This proposal threatens the foundational principles of a merit-based civil service, invites political interference, and risks violating statutory and constitutional protections.

Schedule F would allow career civil servants to be hired and fired without the usual competitive processes or cause, undermining the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act and the protections enshrined in Title 5 of the U.S. Code. These laws exist to ensure that federal employment decisions are made on the basis of merit, not political loyalty.

Such a reclassification also raises serious constitutional concerns. Career federal employees have a recognized property interest in their continued employment, and removing their due process rights could violate the Fifth Amendment. As the Supreme Court made clear in Loudermill (1985), these protections cannot be stripped away arbitrarily.

Schedule F also blurs the line between nonpartisan car

I am a taxpayer and I am writing this comment in my personal capacity. I strongly oppose this rule. This rule wastes tax dollars, threatens and compromises our democracy, and is bad for the American people.  




This rule wastes tax dollars: 
As an employer, it is the federal government‚Äôs responsibility to recruit the best fit for the role, train these employees, and set them up for success. When these employees underperform, it is the government's responsibility to work with them to remedy the issue. Turnover is costly, and the government and managers must reduce turnover to be good stewards of taxpayer money. This rule will do the opposite by increasing turnover and making mass firings easier with the change of the administration's political party.

   Text sample: I am a current federal employee and strongly oppose the proposition to turn federal civil service employees into at-will employees for multiple reasons. 

First, such a proposition is extremely expensive and will cause unnecessary government spending waste. It is incredibly expensive to recruit, do background checks on, and train hired federal employees. If those employees were to be fired with every change in administration, all the money invested in them would be wasted. And then, would need to be spent again to rehire workers. It would be an endless cycle of unnecessary and wasteful spending. 

Second, the idea of turning federal civil service employees to at-will employees is flawed. As a federal employee, I do not serve at the will of the president, as I do not work for the president. I work for the American public. So to deem us "at-will", whose "will" are we specifically talking about?

If there were drastic turn over in our office every 4-8 years this would make progressing on out work very difficult. This will hurt the ability of offices to keep strong teams in place and create more turn over than already exists when there are administration transitions.

The new proposed rule by the Trump administration to reclassify 50,000 federal workers is a purely partisan initiative, as nearly all of the Executive Orders issued by Trump have been. If instituted, it will allow politicized personnel decisions so that, if the employee does not pledge fealty to the current administration, it will be much easier to fire them for politically motivated reasons. It also essentially eliminates recourse for employees who think they have been unfairly discharged or disciplined. This rule smacks of "union-busting" and a "keep the masses on their asses" mentality. The obvious intent is to make federal civil service a partisan activity with compensation and job security based on loyalty to the administration rather than the citizens of the United States.

   Text sample: The civil service is grounded in the principle that public servants owe allegiance to the Constitution, not to any single President or political agenda. This rule flips that principle on its head. It asserts that employees in Schedule Policy/Career roles must ‚Äúfaithfully implement administration policies‚Äù and that failure to do so‚Äîeven in the absence of misconduct, justifies immediate dismissal. In practice, that means career professionals are now expected to suppress dissent, comply without question, and ignore potential ethical, legal, or factual concerns. The message is clear: loyalty will be rewarded with job security; scrutiny or resistance will result in removal. This is not accountability, it is the institutionalization of obedience. The public deserves a federal workforce that can speak truth to power, identify flaws in policy, and uphold the rule of law without fear of reprisal. This rule extinguishes that capacity. It invites political interference, undermines morale, and en

   Text sample: As a longtime, now retired, federal civil servant, I strongly support the stated purpose of this rule, ‚Äúimproving performance, accountability and responsiveness in the civil service‚Äù as well as the more specific goal of making it easier to fire poorly performing employees -- after appropriate efforts to remedy the situation, whether through training, discipline or other means have been tried and failed.

However, the proposed rule changes would not in any way actually improve this situation but would likely make it much worse. The reason for this discrepancy is that the rule‚Äôs faulty solution is to increase White House political control of the civil service rather than empowering front-line managers to manage the situation with their direct reports more effectively.  

The proposal is pervaded with language making clear that it is based on the fallacy that the sole purpose of the civil service is to serve the whims of the president.  In fact, every public servant is required to take an

College drop-outs in their early 20s have been granted GS-15 positions and payroll despite not possessing the qualifications necessary for literally everyone else.

   Text sample: I am commenting on the rule Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service, OPM-2025-0004-0001.

The civil service laws dating back to the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act (1883) and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 have shaped the modern civil service system.

These are acts of the U.S. Congress, put in place to protect federal workers from the rules like the OPM-2025-0004-0001 is proposing to change.

Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act (1883) aimed to dismantle the "spoils system," where political party members were rewarded with government jobs, regardless of their qualifications.

Additionally, the Pendleton Act established the principle that federal jobs should be awarded based on merit, assessed through competitive examinations.

The act prohibited the firing or demotion of government employees solely for political reasons.

 It takes not only knowledge of a particular area of employment, but also time to fully understand how an agency, group or office functions. Frequently more education or training is needed and  justified as situations in the workplace change. An employee will become more involved and more enthusiastic about the outcomes produced by their position. They strive to achieve those desired outcomes.

Please withdraw/reject this regulation and sustain the existing laws/regulations governing the US Civil Service.

As a former federal employee I can tell you from experience that if we had to cope with layers of civil service employees who put loyalty above the constitution and so distorted the mission of our agency we would have accomplished very little, and done so at a cost exponentially higher.  

The new regulation proposes to do away with civil service employees' "injecting their personal policy preferences" into the work of the government. But fails to describe how OPM would recognize this injection or what actions would limit or eliminate these. The new regulation, asserts that it would address these "injections" while failing to state how or how such can be measured. 

Certainly statements are made about a lack of confidence among managers regarding their ability to fire or otherwise deal with low performers

Reg. 17182, Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004 ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service." As a labor relations expert, I have seen the destabilizing and costly impacts for both employers and workers of decertifying unions and banning collective bargaining rights for workers. This regulation would lead to the exclusion of numerous federal employees from union representation and collective bargaining agreements, particularly those in policy-influencing roles. Workers reclassified into the Schedule Policy/Career would lose critical procedural protections previously guaranteed by union-negotiated agreements, including grievance arbitration and appeal rights. With fewer mechanisms for resolving conflicts internally, labor relations disputes escalate into costly and time-consuming litigation, draining taxpayer resources. Further, employees would have no avenue to challenge

   Text sample: I strongly oppose and am flabbergasted by the reimplementation of Schedule F as proposed in Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service."

As a retired career Civil Service employee with 34 years with five federal agencies in the Department of Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency, I find this proposed Rule‚Äôs premise utterly false. Namely, it asserts that, ‚ÄúIt very difficult for agencies to hold employees accountable for their performance or conduct,‚Äù making it cumbersome to correct bad behavior, reprimand or dismiss an employee.  As a supervisor of Federal employees, I took the evaluation process seriously as did my employees and supervisors. I even fired one employee for poor performance. 


The clear intent of Schedule F is to allow political appointees to fire experts without cause and replace them with ideologically-aligned hires who may lack the experience or qualifications to manage public lands or otherwise

   Text sample: While this proposed rule is described as ensuring that the civil service remains nonpartisan, the ability to move federal jobs into Schedule Policy/Career will in fact increase the number of partisan positions in our civil service. 
The expansion of Schedule F (aka Schedule P/C) was explicitly listed as a strategy to remove and replace current federal employees in the Project 2025 Mandate for Leadership. On page 271, USAID was floated as a potential guinea pig for the implementation of a new Schedule F executive order in combination with an effort to "aggressively recruit and place candidates into term-limited positions under Schedule A of the Excepted Service." In other words, current civil servants would be fired and replaced with appointees. The implication is that the new appointees will be loyal to the administration that appoints them above all else. In the long term, this will cause currently non-partisan positions to become partisan ones which turn over every four to eight year

   Text sample: I urge you not to implement this rule change.

Signing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 into law was the best action of President Chester Arthur's Presidency. It transformed a civil service that ran on a political patronage spoils system into one that ran on merit and was accountable to all. It would be a great mistake to undo this civil service reform of Chester Arthur by reinstating Schedule F.

Having a large number of non-political civil service employees ensures continuity of knowledge and expertise between presidential administrations. For example, Foreign Service Officers and other State Department employees align themselves with the policies of the new administration but retain their area knowledge. And it provides a barrier against attempts by an administration to weaponize the government - for example, the Department of Justice - against the other party, or critics of the current President.

Submitted in my personal capacity as a United States citizen.

I write in strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs proposed rule establishing Schedule P/C, which would allow the President to reclassify thousands of federal civil servants as at-will employees. While I submit this comment in my personal capacity, I offer it from the perspective of someone who has spent years enforcing the law on behalf of the public.

I currently serve as an enforcement attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and previously served in a similar capacity at the Federal Trade Commission. At both agencies, my job has been to apply the law as written and protect the public from unlawful and deceptive practices, regardless of who is in political power. That work depends on the ability of civil servants to offer independent legal and policy analysis without fear of political retaliation. This rule would undermine that independ

   Text sample: I am writing in opposition to the proposed rule to establish a ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù (formerly Schedule F) classification for the career Civil Service. This proposal is based on the false pretext of rampant corruption and underperformance in the senior ranks of the Civil Service and, if adopted, would engender the very problems it purports to correct. It misrepresents the essential precepts of sound policy making as ‚Äúinsubordination‚Äù and, by undermining those precepts, would result in worse decision making and worse outcomes for the American people.

The rule cites no evidence that the poor performance is a problem at the senior levels to which the proposed rule would apply. In my experience, those in policy positions are among the top performers in the Civil Service, and have been promoted to their positions for their high performance. The proposed rule would enable political appointees to fire them at will. Their replacements are likely to be less qualified, have less experience a

The stated goal of this proposed rule is to increase "accountability", but nothing in the rule or supplementary materials explains how making policymaking employees at-will would actually better ensure that such employees are able to complete the duty as I've described it. Instead, the circumstances that this rule anticipates are one in which an administration directs career federal employees to enact a specific policy and, if the employee does not comply, that employee is deemed "partisan" and at risk of being summarily fired. What if that career employee, when researching the a specific policy, determines that a specific policy cannot be implemented because it does not conform to existing law, bec

   Text sample: The professional Civil Service was created in 1883 because the problems of patronage in government service had become extreme, and even resulted in the assassination of President Garfield. The idea of Schedule F is not new - it's what we had in the United States from its founding until the Civil Service Act was passed in 1883. It did not work well. Corruption was rife, and political considerations trumped the professional execution of the duties of the federal workforce. Since 1883, the Civil Service continued on the path of professionalism, and it remains a neutral and professional force within the government, dedicated to the American people and the best interests of the United States. Civil servants are expected to carry out the policies of the President of the United States, while also ensuring that governmental actions are carried out in accordance with the relevant laws.

The idea that a Schedule F cadre will improve the quality of the workforce is folly. When the Civil Service i

In their argument, OPM cites a past FEVS survey shows high federal employee satisfaction and other mischaracterized data to support their claim for returning to the previous system that was in place prior to the Biden administration. This argument is in bad faith.

In my broad and deep experience, I have never, ever seen personal political views play into how civil servants serve Administration political appointees. This approach of serving whichever party's political appointees without regard to personal views has always been an automatic, unthinking, unchallenged response by civil servants: it's built into the DNA of how we carry out our jobs.

As a federal contractor working with the military I see firsthand the impact that government civilians have on the decisions that affect the American people. It is vitally important that these civilians have the authority and confidence to make smart decisions regardless of the political whims of their leadership. Despite the trivial claims made in this proposal, I have never seen any government civilian push a personal or political agenda in a professional setting. Rather, I have seen these civil servants make difficult decisions based on scientific evidence and the accumulated experience of many years of selfless service. They need the support of leadership to continue doing their jobs apolitically in the best interest of all of us.

I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed rule titled "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" (RIN 3206‚ÄìAO80), particularly regarding its implementation at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

   Text sample: All the explanations given here about why this change needs to be done are completely disingenuous. First, the question must be asked, ‚ÄúHow often is removal of an incompetent Civil Service employee or one who has engaged in misconduct been stymied by our current procedures?‚Äù Unless it occurs so often as to render the work of government ineffective, claims that this change is necessary are specious. Anecdotal examples of horror stories about getting rid of a bad employee can always be dredged up, but the few cases hardly justify a wholesale policy change. In fact, making top level Civil Service employees subject to ‚Äúat will‚Äù rules via Schedule F is likely to make government less effective, since they will need to be looking over their shoulders about the whims of higher ups. Or is making government less effective a hidden agenda for this proposed change?
And that question leads to my second point. The Administration has blatantly advertised its real goal of turning the 50,000 highest le

   Text sample: I am strongly opposed to the implementation or revival of the ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù classification for federal employees. This proposal poses a serious threat to the merit-based civil service system that has supported a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for more than a century.

At its core, Schedule F undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was established to dismantle the spoils system and create a merit-based hiring framework for federal employment. Reclassifying large numbers of career civil servants‚Äîparticularly those involved in policy development or analysis‚Äîwould allow for their removal without cause and invite politically motivated personnel decisions. This directly contradicts the principle of a politically neutral civil service, as articulated in 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301(b)(8), which requires that federal employment decisions be based on merit and shielded from political interference.

Introduction: OPM-2025-0004
I am writing as the spouse of a dedicated federal employee who has served our country for 34 years. My spouse‚Äôs position has always been nonpartisan and does not involve the development or influence of public policy. Yet under the proposed schedule policy/career rule, their role is now being considered for reclassification into an ‚Äúexcepted service‚Äù category. I am deeply concerned about the fairness, transparency, and potential harm of this action‚Äîboth to my family and to thousands of similarly affected public servants.

Background:
This comment is in response to the agency‚Äôs proposal to implement the schedule policy/career rule, which aims to reclassify certain federal employees into a new employment category outside of traditional civil service protections, based on a vague standard of "policy influence." This rule appears to revive elements of the previously withdrawn Schedule F proposal.

Their deep institutional knowledge, developed over years or even decades of service through various administrations and legislative changes, was absolutely invaluable to effectively implementing complex workforce development programs and serving the American public. These individuals reached senior levels, such as directors and key policy advisors, precisely because they consistently demonstrated high performance, policy acumen, and effective execution over extended periods under the existing merit system principles.

Dear Office of Personnel Management,

The removal of explicit prohibitions against discrimination based on gender identity‚Äîspecifically through the elimination of the "Prohibition of Segregated Facilities" clause (FAR 52.222-21)‚Äîis deeply troubling.

This new rule makes my very worried that government employees who are doing their job and trying to do what is best for the American people are at risk of being targeted for political reasons.

Many of the projects I‚Äôve been involved in require multiple years planning, and this proposal from the Office of Personnel Management Docket ID (OPM-2025-0004) and RIN (3206-AO80) will undermine the ability of government agencies to support greater well being and community involvement through disruption and delay.  The ability to remove government employees at will is already having a deleteri

This proposed policy would harm the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs independence and hamper its ability to protect New York residents from cancer-causing chemicals like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), commonly known as ‚Äúforever chemicals.‚Äù 


By reclassifying large portions of the Federal workforce as ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career" (P/C) employees, the proposed policy would make it easier to fire EPA workers who present evidence of harms caused by new or existing chemicals, leading to policies that hurt Americans and cause lasting ecological harm.

Hello. My name is Marc Schmied. I am a 57 year old semi-retired musician and passionate environmental activist with 350.org. I live in Columbia county, New York. I love my country and planet Earth and I am concerned about President Trump‚Äôs reduction of vital government agencies such as the EPA.

Since its inception, the EPA has worked to protect American citizens from the serious (even life-threatening) effects of toxic chemicals in our food, air and water systems. Current EPA campaigns include identifying and remediating ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù such as PFAS from New York‚Äôs water. Here is a link to an EPA study showing how pervasive these toxic chemicals are: https://www.ewg.org/interactive-maps/2021_suspected_industrial_discharges_of_pfas/map/

To whom it may concern, I am a concerned citizen who currently lives in North Carolina. A few months ago we had a terrible hurricane sweep through our state that killed over a hundred people and caused irreparable damage to our communities and infrastructure. I am concerned that the proposed changes to the OPM would lead to a less professional federal work worse, which would reduce the efficiency of FEMA, the National Weather Service, and the EPA which are all vital agencies when disaster strikes. We rely on the EPA to study how natural disasters occur and how they can be prevented, we rely on the National Weather Service to accurately predict and forecast them so that people can be adequately warned in advance, and we rely on FEMA to help clean up and revive communities after damage has been done.

Career federal employees are essential for maintaining consistent, effective government operations‚Äîespecially during transitions between administrations.

 Submitted in my personal capacity
I am writing as a U.S. citizen and former federal employee to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule to reintroduce Schedule F under the new classification ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù (P/C). This policy threatens the integrity, professionalism, and effectiveness of the civil service and opens the door to politically motivated manipulation of federal operations.
The proposed rule estimates that approximately 50,000 employees could be reclassified under Schedule P/C. However, based on OPM‚Äôs own language and recent experience with similar efforts, that figure is likely a significant underestimate. In reality, agencies could reclassify hundreds of thousands of roles‚Äîparticularly since the definition of ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù is vague and easily exploited.

Additionally, the following sentence states that "career employees perform less effectively under appointees they politically disagree with (pg. 17192)." However, this study examined only procurement officers, not the entire civil service. The inline text mischaracterizes the study's findings and generalized a specific subset of workers to the entire Federal workforce. 

Finally, OPM should provide a citation on that same page when they state "academics...widely conclude that many career Federal employees - especially those with policy responsibilities - inject their personal politics and preferences into the performance of their official duties (pg. 17192)." OPM should avoi

   Text sample: To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed rule titled ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.‚Äù The proposal to reclassify policy-influencing positions as Schedule F (Policy/Career), making them at-will and exempt from standard adverse action procedures and appeals, is deeply concerning. While the administration asserts that this change will allow for the swift removal of employees who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or intentionally subvert Presidential directives, the broad scope and potential for misuse of this authority outweigh the purported benefits.

My own experience highlights the overreach of this proposed regulation. I previously held a federal position identified as potentially subject to this reclassification. I led scientists and oversaw the planning and execution of operations. Similarly, positions in my organization marked for reclassification

To Whom It May Concern:
I write, as a conscientious and engaged private citizen, to record in unambiguous and
unequivocal terms my categorical opposition to the proposed regulatory action identified as
OPM-2025-0004-0001. This initiative, which would facilitate the executive branch‚Äôs unilateral

the justification relied upon by OPM, the relation of this rule to the its recent
antecedents, and finally the framework underlying this rule that begs a very important
question.
Regarding the historical and policy justifications for the rule, the OPM seems to have
constructed a series of rationales for this rule change on an unsecure foundation. First,
it resorts to examples that seem inappropriately contextualized or irrelevant. Alleged

   Text sample: The creation of the so-called Schedule F classification for career federal civil servants is unjustified and dangerous. While the stated motivation for this action is to increase accountability for under performers, the scope of positions (i.e, policy influencing positions), intimates that the goal is politically motivated only. The intended purpose is to exert leverage over career civil servants to extort undue loyalty that will enable the administration to continue undertaking unlawful and unethical actions, unchallenged and unchecked. 

In reality, there are systems and procedures in place to address behavioral and performance problems in the federal government. While these policies and processes are differentially used, this does not serve as proof that they are not effectual overall when employed correctly. 

This administration offers no credible data or legal/historical argument that warrants or justifies the creation of the so-called Schedule F classification. The only function

This proposed rule threatens to undermine the principles of a professional, nonpartisan, and merit-based federal workforce, and I have several concerns that I urge you to address.

1. The Scope of the Proposed Rule
While the rule is presented as a mechanism to provide more flexibility in managing senior policymakers, there is a clear and concerning lack of specificity regarding which employees will be affected.

Turning such positions into political appointments means the very basis of scientific inquiry will be subverted to politics, destroying our standing as a beacon of unbiased scientific inquiry to the world.  As an employee, I saw a subpar personal be removed from their position after proper procedures for terminating their employment were followed.

The NSF, which played a pivotal role in the development of the internet, exemplifies the critical importance of sustained investment in foundational research‚Äîan importance that cannot be overstated.

By reducing support for these institutions, the administration has effectively undermined its own stated priorities in advancing science and technology. These actions appear to reflect a broader pattern of governance that is, at its core, reckless, arbitrary, and capricious‚Äîmarked by disorganization, inconsistency, a lack of understanding, and an alarming disregard for long-term consequences.

It would discourage public-minded people from aspiring to a career in public service in the first place and instead leave the public at the mercy of cynical toadies.  

Reviving the corruption and ineptitude of the spoils system is only the mildest and most predictable of this rule‚Äôs adverse consequences. What‚Äôs worse is that it prioritizes ideology over expertise and devotion to duty.

Though I'm certain there are ways in which the career employee system can be meaningfully reformed, that is not the intention of this proposed action. It is a nakedly partisan and political effort to "bring the deep state to heel" and hamstring the work of government agencies. Expertise and experience in important public service sectors comes with educational achievement, commitment to service, and dedication to the work. It is a tremendous public value. It ensures that agencies are focused on their mandates and competent to perform them on behalf of the people. On the other hand, political loyalty is cheap and shallow, exercised for immediate political benefit of specific parties and individuals. When experts at important agencies, created by Congress, advise the President and Cabinet regarding their agencies and domains, they are speaking on behalf of the

1. Lack of impact analysis on DEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility) - The proposed rule includes no assessment of how removing adverse action protections might disproportionately impact underrepresented groups. EO 14035, which mandates agency support for DEIA, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, obligate OPM to evaluate the potential for disparate impact across protected classes.

Because we were civil servants, there to serve the public.  This is very different from what the Trump administration is proposing - to strip the federal government of all of its dedicated civil servants, ready to serve the public, trained and possessing expertise that they have worked years to develop.  Whether attorneys, economists, scientists, or other professionals, their goal is to provide truthful information to the public.

Federal employees do not align allegiance to the President, they are aligned with the Constitution. If the request is neither illegal nor immoral, the employee should actively engage in the project. Asking questions and pushing back are not conduct issues. Political leadership often has a goal in mind but are often unfamiliar with statutes, regulations, and processes to accomplish those goals 

When federal employees do not complete assigned duties, OPM under 5CFR, regulations, and procedures offers prescribed alternatives to conduct and performance issues. The PR mentions frequently that employees and supervisors don't believe they can discipline at fed. They can and more often than not supervisors do not take the necessary steps because they are unwilling or unable to do the hard work.

   Text sample: I respectfully submit this comment to raise concerns over the lack of procedural safeguards and classification clarity in the proposed Schedule Policy/Career rule. 

1. There are no appeals or redress mechanism. The rule provides no way for employees to challenge a reclassification, even if it is incorrect or inconsistent with their actual duties. This violates principles of procedural fairness and may run afoul of Loudermill, 470 US 532 (1985), which recognizes due process protections for career employees. OPM must explain how it will safeguard employees from erroneous or arbitrary classification.

2. There is lack of clear classification criteria. There is no detailed standard to determine who qualifies as "policy-influencing." Relying on vague language in a position description or simply being a supervisor does not mean an employee has policy-making authority. Many supervisors manage operational staff and execute and not shape policy. OPM must provide clear, functional guidance and

   Text sample: At the beginning of Trump‚Äôs presidency, there were major disruptions to the government‚Äôs science agencies. Many employees were fired or moved to new roles under the excuse of improving efficiency, but this caused confusion and chaos. Some research projects lost funding halfway through just for using certain terms. Spending was delayed or blocked on purpose, with the goal of making these cuts permanent.

While scientists were still trying to figure out how things would work under this new leadership, the Trump administration had a plan to bring more political control over government science‚Äîboth in how science is funded and how it‚Äôs used in policymaking.

A big part of that plan is something called ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù (now ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù). It‚Äôs an executive order that would change how thousands of government workers are classified. Right now, most career civil servants are hired based on skill and protected from political pressure. But Schedule F would remove those protections, recla

It opens the door to politically motivated firings and tramples on employees‚Äô constitutional and statutory rights.

My name is Nick Donze and I am a citizen of the United States living in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, 63670.  My following comments are in reference to OPM's Docket ID (OPM-2025-0004), RIN (3206-AO80).
I am in opposition to OPM's proposed changes to the employment status of civil servants in our government for the following reasons:
Civil servants are the backbone of our government by providing continuity of services that the citizens of the United States rely on. If the rule changes are enacted, political loyalty would become more important than professional expertise. Furthermore, the firing of civil servants for political reasons would drain the federal government of skilled and experienced workers necessary for the federal government‚Äôs complex and necessary work.  Scientists and scientific research would be put at risk.  It would allow for political appointees to remove scientists at will who present scientifi

As a federal employee commenting in my personal capacity, I strongly oppose the proposed rule to reintroduce Schedule F. This policy would mark an unprecedented increase in the politicization of the federal workforce, threatening the integrity, effectiveness, and nonpartisan foundation of the civil service.
I work with Veterans in mental health treatment, focusing on preventing overdose and substance use. This work is grounded in evidence, guided by public health priorities, and designed to serve all Veterans‚Äîregardless of political affiliation. Our ability to carry out this mission depends on a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service staffed by qualified professionals who are committed to public service‚Äînot political agendas.

RE: federal register proposal to create new status form for policy federal workers as determined by the President

I worked as a Washington State employee and then as a federal employee.  In both cases as a career service employee.   But, I worked in "Policy" offices.  I ran them.  As manager I oversaw research and the develpment of policy papers.  My boss - a schedule c / senate confirmed official - told me he wanted policy options papers without recommendations.  Many of my fellow career workers said this was unfair, as they knew more than the boss and should always include their recommendation.  I argued with them and included the insubordination in their performance reviews, but several still always included a recommendation and rationale.  I always deleted that section before submitting the paper to my boss, per their instructions.  But, only after reading the recommendation and then doing some editing for neutrality and to introduce more objectivity into wo

   Text sample: Do not politicize government civil service work.

‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù (now renamed Schedule Policy/Career) is shorthand for an executive order that is a sharp break with civil service merit principles, which assume that career employees should be retained on the basis of performance and protected against political coercion. The US is already unusual in the degree to which it reserves the top layers of organizational leadership for short-term political appointees. Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections, the basic constraint against political interference.

Studies show that politicization of public services generally worsens public-sector outcomes. Public employees invest less in developing their expertise and become more likely to exit. Instability and lack of experience reduce organizational performance. Politicization increa

I strongly support this Proposed Rule, if it is enacted as actually described and not simply as a cover to eliminate or gap additional positions. In fact, I believe that except in specific or critical circumstances, the vast majority of civil service positions should be reclassified under this rule. In my experience, and in my opinion, civil service tenure and inability for supervisors to easily remove underperforming (relatively common) or undermining (rare) employees is not a best practice we should be following. This proposed rule would only impact a small percentage of employees and would be a great step toward improving the performance and culture of the civil servant workforce. Specifically:

After reviewing the document, I understand that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing changes that may significantly harm federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As a parent, someone with a doctorate in public health, and an environmentalist, I am deeply troubled by these proposed changes and their potential adverse effects on the EPA's mission and operations.
The justification provided for the rule is not evidence-based. For example, the proposal asserts that there is widespread ‚Äúresistance‚Äù to Administration policies within the civil service, and it cites employee surveys asking about perceptions of poor performance and misconduct, a poll, and anecdotal cases as evidence. These sources do not demonstrate a pattern.

Our work was bound by very detailed and clearly precedented law and international agreements, so the amount of damage an unqualified political appointee could do was limited.

   Text sample: The strength of the Federal service comes from the non-partisan nature of its employees, who are able to maintain high standards of performance and ethics across administrations no matter what party has won the election for the White House or Congress. This is possible because the employees in Federal service are not beholden in any way to the political agendas or players in any branch of government for their job security. The guidelines protecting Federal employees from termination for reasons other than cause were carefully designed for a specific purpose: to prevent partisan actors from compromising the effectiveness of the Federal workforce by using actual or threatened job termination to undermine agency principles or missions. We have already seen the current administration embroiled in legal fights over their attempts to compromise the effectiveness of the Federal workforce by terminating thousands of Federal workers illegally.

   Text sample: The proposed rule Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service, while intended to streamline federal employment practices, presents substantial concerns and I oppose the rule, as proposed. One of the core provisions of the rule is to make it easier to remove underperforming federal employees. However, data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) consistently shows that the rate of removal for poor performance in the federal workforce is already low not due to inefficiency, but because of structured performance improvement plans and review mechanisms that prioritize fairness and due process. Accelerating removals risks undermining these mechanisms without data-backed evidence of improved outcomes.

Secondly, the proposed changes could have a chilling effect on workforce morale and retention. Surveys such as the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) highlight that trust in leadership and job security are key predictors of employee engagement and

I agree with the many observers of the U.S. federal civil service argue that while our civil service cadre is generally hard-working and high-performing, the service would benefit from thoughtful reforms.

Unfortunately, however, the proposed rule, in fact, accomplishes exactly the opposite: far deeper penetration of partisan or personal preferences into what should be nonpartisan federal government work. 

OPM argues that under this proposed rule, the newly defined ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù jobs will be ‚Äúopen to employees of any political persuasion so long as they perform well and faithfully implement the President's agenda to the best of their abilities.‚Äù But the vague phrases ‚Äúperform well‚Äù and ‚Äúfaithfully implement‚Äù are obviously subject to numerous possible definitions and, under the text of the proposed rule, subject to the President‚Äôs own interpretation.

* Swinging from extreme to extreme: A stable civil service keeps our country from swinging from one extreme to the other when we elect a new president, whether the new president is a liberal or a conservative. Reclassifying federal workers to allow them to be fired for political reasons undermines this important purpose.

* One step closer to authoritarianism: Quite apart from the current administration, the presidency as a whole has slowly expanded its authority over the past 200 years to encompass powers that rightfully belong to Congress and the Judiciary.

The proposed rule announced by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under Docket (OPM-2025-0004) represents a fundamentally flawed and dangerous departure from the core principles of a fair, merit-based, and nonpartisan federal civil service. This rule is not about improving human resource management; rather, it is an attack on the fundamental protections that ensure federal employees operate without undue political interference, harassment, or fear of arbitrary dismissal. It should never have been proposed because it threatens to undermine the integrity, stability, and professionalism of the federal workforce, to the detriment of the nation‚Äôs governance.

This was very important to the members of the public who interacted with us.  Both workers and employers needed to know that the members of a regional office were trying to apply the law and not trying to curry favor with political appointees.  

The decisions we made were often thoroughly discussed by a team of people in the office who had the institutional memory to understand the facts and the rules.

   Text sample: I am very strongly against the Schedule Policy order because it risks gutting the expertise-based civil service and replacing this with loyalists to one administration. This is highly inefficient, as new administrations will consistently bring in their own loyalists. Every four years, removing all expertise based consistency and long-term planning. A new Schedule F policy poses a significant threat to the integrity and effectiveness of our government by undermining the professional civil service. For over a century, a merit-based system has been the cornerstone of a stable and capable public sector, ensuring that individuals are hired and retained based on their skills, qualifications, and expertise, rather than political affiliation. This nonpartisan approach fosters a culture of professionalism, continuity, and institutional knowledge that is essential for the government to function efficiently and serve the public interest effectively.

I absolutely DO NOT support this ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù proposal sham. 

‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service‚Äù posted by the Office of Personnel Management on Apr 22, 2025 is amazing.  How many person hours were spent penning this 39,824 worded ‚Äúdocument‚Äù? No doubt it was developed by a cloistered think tank of special interest groups & lobbyists.

I am writing to oppose the proposed rule, [Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004], RIN 3206-AO80, entitled:  ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service. Experienced, nonpartisan civil servants provide valuable institutional knowledge that keeps the government running and serving *all* Americans, no matter who is in office. Stealing these workers' jobs to give them to inexperienced, partisan political appointees would undermine federal agencies and make them less able to provide the services Congress has created and funded. 

The current administration seems to believe that the long-accumulated wealth of our nation, including our wealth of highly trained and dedicated nonpartisan civil servants, belongs to whoever won the last election. No. It was created by us all and our forebears, and it belongs to us all and our heirs. It must be preserved by whoever has been entrusted with temporary power over the federal government.

Comments on Proposed OPM Rule on ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career‚Äù
I am submitting these comments in opposition to the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed
regulation ‚ÄúSchedule Policy/Career.‚Äù The proposed rule undermines more than 140 years of civil service reform
following the spoils system. It opens the door to politically motivated firings and tramples on employees‚Äô
constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, the proposed regulation to dismantle civil service protections
destabilizes the career workforce, politicizes the day- to- day work of government, and erodes the very idea of a
professional, independent civil service. Specific concerns are presented below.
ÔÇ∑ Performance: This proposal gives lip service to performance management, but rather than providing
thoughtful reform, it weaponizes the classification of ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù roles to make it easier to purge
career staff.

   Text sample: I strongly oppose any efforts to revive or implement policies like Schedule F, which would unlawfully strip civil service protections from tens of thousands of career federal employees. Schedule F seeks to reclassify nonpartisan professionals as ‚Äúconfidential or policy-determining‚Äù employees‚Äîa designation reserved by law for political appointees‚Äînot for career staff carrying out the technical and administrative work of government.

As detailed in the January 2025 Issue Brief from Governing for Impact, Schedule F attempts to circumvent longstanding merit-based hiring rules by creating a broad exception to civil service protections. This contradicts both the letter and the spirit of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was enacted to prevent exactly this type of patronage-based employment. The law, and its consistent interpretation over decades, requires that federal employees be hired and retained based on merit‚Äînot politics.

The proposed reclassification would violate due proce

   Text sample: I am an academic researcher who has both received funding from the National Science Foundation and served on multiple peer-review boards for submitted proposals. It is essential that the administration of this very successful public funding of science research remain independent of the views of shifting political administrations, as noted when Congress passed the original National Science Foundation Act of 1950 (establishing NSF as an ‚Äúindependent agency‚Äù). Reclassifying administrator positions as falling under Schedule F, which would limit their decision-making to be in accord with whomever is currently the U.S. President, would severely compromise this important work. Progress in science is often slow, painstaking, and comes from the accretion of knowledge over many years with the contributions of multiple scientists from different labs across the United States (e.g., funding has been awarded to researchers in all 50 states).

   Text sample: As a federal employee commenting in my personal capacity, I strongly oppose the proposed rule. This policy would politicize the federal workforce and threaten the integrity and effectiveness of the civil service. This rule does not pertain to performance issues. If it did, my agency would not have returned over $21 billion to consumers since its inception. Does that sound like poor performance to you? I see it as more about power and simply disdain for consumers and government employees. We are committed to providing support to individuals who may not have the means or ability to represent their own interests. 
In my work I hold financial institutions accountable, make sure their products, services and practices are fair for all consumers and that they follow federal consumer financial laws. My work involves establishing and maintaining respectable and collaborative relationships with financial institutions, such as mortgage companies, small lenders, auto loan servicers, credit bureaus

   Text sample: strongly object to the proposed rule "Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" (Federal Register Doc. No. 2025-06904). This rule, reclassifying "policy-influencing" positions to "at-will" status ("Schedule Policy/Career"), would strip vital civil service protections, severely undermining our government's integrity, efficacy, and foundational principles.

1. Threatens Merit-Based Civil Service & Invites Politicization:
This rule moves away from the merit-based system established by the Pendleton Act, risking a return to a spoils system where political loyalty outweighs competence. A nonpartisan civil service is crucial for effective, impartial policy implementation. Stripping job protections for those in "policy-influencing" roles will chill frank, evidence-based advice, particularly in scientific and technical fields, if such advice contradicts political agendas. The result will be a loss of expertise, institutional memory, and a decline in the q

There's a reason that President Ulysses Grant cooperated with Congress to create the first Civil Service Commission, replacing a system where political loyalty was more important than actual expertise to do the work. If additional evidence for why this proposed rule would be a disaster for the government, one need look no further than the past hundred days - as unqualified political hacks with little or no statutory or regulatory authority to back them - have basically run amok throughout the entire federal government, wasting tremendous amounts of taxpayers' money to accomplish little more than satisfying the grievance politics of MAGAts. Alongside that, these overcompensated, under-qualified louts have been mining databases crammed full of Americans' highly sensitive, personally identifying protected information

   Text sample: I oppose this proposed rule because it allows any Administration to replace the nation's policy experts who serve the Constitution across Administrations with individuals who subordinate their duty to the Constitution and the law to partisan loyalties. It has the potential to eliminate institutional knowledge and consistency as administration's use public service jobs to reward cronies or pad the public services with sycophants who will do their political bidding.

I oppose the creation of the Schedule Policy/Career as a new category of Excepted Service under 5 CFR Part 213. Moving career civil servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by putting those employees at risk of termination should their efforts to uphold the federal oath of employment to defend the Constitution conflict with a political appointee's belief that the employee has failed to "faithfully implement administration

I joined the civil service as a social worker because I am passionate about helping others. My mother modeled that approach to life and still is actively volunteering in her retirement years, helping the homeless and released inmates.

It is clear that the effect of this rule would be to reduce expertise in the government and value personal loyalty, not to the policies of the United States, but to the whims of the President. No President is a total expert on Constitutional law, statutory law, or regulatory rules. It is necessary that those whom the People of the United States employ in our Executive Branch have the appropriate expertise in their fields. This comes from lifetimes of dedication into what, for any President, would be an obscure topic. Of particular concern in this proposed rule is the following: "or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives." It is extremely dangerous that the Executive Branch that is proposing this rule seems to be of the opinion that winning an election gives it carte blanche to do anything it wishes, and it holds up the democratic process (the federal method of electing the President isn't purely democra

Comment Opposing Reinstatement of Schedule F
From: Anonymous
Comment Opposing Reinstatement of Schedule F
I submit this comment in strong opposition to the reinstatement of Schedule F. As a career
federal employee at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), I have seen firsthand the critical
need for a professional, apolitical civil service. I was recently impacted by a Reduction in Force
(RIF), and I offer this comment with direct knowledge of the instability federal employees already
face without adding the threat of political reclassification.
Politicization of Civil Service Weakens Public Trust and Institutional Memory
Schedule F would allow agencies to reclassify career roles as ‚Äúconfidential, policy-determining,
policymaking, or policy-advocating‚Äù and terminate employees at will. This reopens the door to
politically motivated purges of career experts, which contradicts the apolitical foundation of the

   Text sample: In October 2020, the Trump administration issued Executive Order 13957, creating a new classification within the federal workforce known as "Schedule F." This classification aimed to reclassify a significant number of career federal employees‚Äîparticularly those in policy-related roles‚Äîas "excepted service," thereby stripping them of traditional civil service protections such as due process and merit-based hiring. Although this order was rescinded by President Joe Biden in January 2021, there has been renewed discussion and advocacy among certain political factions to reinstate Schedule F, potentially with even broader scope.

Reinstating Schedule F would not only disrupt the long-standing principles of a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce, but it would also open the door to widespread political patronage, reduce institutional expertise, and erode public trust in government.

At the heart of opposition to Schedule F is the erosion of civil service protections. Under the current

Similarly, the vast majority of Federal supervisors are not ‚Äúpolicy influencing.‚Äù  Yet this proposed rule would give the President the authority to move all these people into Schedule P/C.

RE: Public Comment in Response to Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service [Docket No. OPM‚Äì2025‚Äì0004]

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. The proposed rule, ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,‚Äù would call into question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for our economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and many other statistics. The federal statistical system plays an essential role in improving the lives of all Americans as well as informing critical policy decisions with evidence that is timely, relevant, and accurate. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule due to the

Staff have been fired or reassigned in the name of efficiency, resulting in chaos. Grants have been canceled mid-project for featuring the wrong words. ‚ÄúPauses‚Äù and ‚Äúreviews‚Äù are designed to block spending, in the hope that Congress will make the current impoundment of funds a baseline for permanent disinvestment. While the scientific community waits to see what the new normal will be, the Trump administration has a plan to institutionalize a much more politicized structure of control over government broadly, including both public scientific investments and the use of scientific knowledge in policy actions.

The proposed rules change regarding procedures for taking action against civil servants is alarming. These changes are being proposed to make it easier to fire employees without cause and due process. Reclassifying a broad category of federal employees is a smokescreen for being able to fire employees for political reasons, not for "accountability" or "responsiveness."

Competent and responsible government work is vital for the health of our country and its citizens. Firing 50,000 federal employees is going  to permanently impact the trust that Americans have in their federal government. The vast majority of these employees are hard working and honest, and are doing their best every day, with little acclaim and low pay. For example, people near retirement age, like me, would like to know that workers in the Social Security Administration are experienced and qualified and able to help

Official federal statistics clearly influence public policy of all sorts: monetary, fiscal, regulatory, etc. Thus, a President could classify many statistical agency positions as Policy/Career.

   Text sample: Schedule F‚Äù (now renamed Schedule Policy/Career) is shorthand for an executive order that is a sharp break with civil service merit principles, which assume that career employees should be retained on the basis of performance and protected against political coercion. The US is already unusual in the degree to which it reserves the top layers of organizational leadership for short-term political appointees. Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections, the basic constraint against political interference.

The administration says that the purpose of Schedule F is to increase accountability for civil servants involved in policy-making.

In essence, the proposed rule eliminates the longstanding procedures that ensure most positions are filled and administered on a nonpartisan basis and opens the door to political appointees eliminating positions without any oversight or review. It is obvious this change is being proposed to allow future actions like the illegal actions recently taken by DOGE to eliminate positions on the basis of purported poor performance where none existed. It also fails to acknowledge

   Text sample: I am writing to express my concerns with the Office of Personnel Management‚Äôs (OPM) proposed rule change to the terms of civil service employment (RIN 3206-A080).  I am a professor of political science and an expert on authoritarianism and democratic backsliding.  In my assessment, this change ‚Äì if approved ‚Äì will have a number of negative consequences, namely weakening the quality of the bureaucracy and undermining the checks and balances that are the hallmark of America‚Äôs healthy democracy,
The proposed rule will enable policy-influencing positions to be moved to Schedule Policy/Career.  This means that these positions will be at-will, so that civil service employees can be quickly removed from their posts and without the right to appeal.  The justification for the rule change is that it will increase career employee accountability, by making it far easier for agencies to remove employees for poor performance or misconduct.  The rule change also states that it will prevent civil serv

   Text sample: I agree with the comment below (not mine).  It is specific in nature and fundamentally addresses both mine and many other comments here. My overarching concern is the purpose and role of federal employees and how can it best be achieved.  I don‚Äôt see how what President Trump is proposing furthers rather than severely impedes that objective not only now, but into the foreseeable future.  

Bottom line, leave it better than you found it.  Empower employees to do better, be better.

Best interpretation of this action falls far short of that goal. It reeks of ‚Äúor else‚Äù. How in any way is that aspirational or inspirational in the best interests of good / better government and the underlying call of at its best, selfless service for the good of the country?

   Text sample: This quoted comment below may bear some similarity to another previously entered, but it is solely because they did such a thorough job that I couldn't say it better myself and felt the need to reiterate it. I'd like to add here that any effort to undermine the true merit-based hiring and retention practices of the Civil Service, the purging of hundreds of years of institutional knowledge, in favor of perceived ideological purity or loyalty to a given President or Administration, will be incredibly and irrevocably damaging to the United States in terms of stability, national security, and international competition. Our national security is paramount to the existence of our country, and reclassifying federal workers would undermine everything we have worked to build since our founding.

   Text sample: I do not support the proposed rule change. It would create a new Schedule Policy/Career category of excepted service career federal employees stripped of adverse action protections, procedures, or appeals. It would expand the powers of the presidency to reclassify existing, competitive service positions as Schedule Policy/Career without the approval of Congress, and to hire career employees while circumventing the competitive hiring process. 

A likely outcome of the reclassification of tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of federal positions to Schedule Policy/Career status would be a shift away from a non-partisan government of subject-matter experts to one where partisan or presidential loyalty tests have a role in the hiring and firing process. This would contribute to a politicization of the federal workforce, which would serve to undermine and further erode public trust in government, and facilitate corruption by rewarding or punishing individuals based on their loya

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which rely on specific expertise to political ones. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule due to the following:

Politicization: Schedule Policy/Career could lead to the politicization of the federal statistical workforce. Official federal statistics clearly influence public policy of all sorts: monetary, fiscal, regulatory, etc. Thus, a President could classify many statistical agency positions as Policy/Career. Then, for example, Bureau of Labor Statistics‚Äô leaders could be fired for releasing or planning to release jobs or inflation statistics unfavorable to the President‚Äôs policy

   Text sample: Schedule Policy/Career, by reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, would bypass the current multiple ways that civil servants are held accountable. It would remove public-sector job protections, the basic constraint against political interference. 

Studies, as well as my fifty years of personal experience in public service, show that politicization of public services generally worsens public-sector outcomes. Politically appointed  employees invest less in developing their expertise and in serving the public rather than their masters, and become more likely to quit. Instability and lack of experience significantly reduces organizational performance and efficiency. 

Politicization increases the influence of more ideologically radical appointees over dedicated civil servants. It also reduces accountability. Bureaucrats worried about being fired fail to share contradictory information with their political bosses and become less likely to respond to congressional oversight. As

Calling it a way to increase accountability is like trying to put lipstick on a pig.  Appointing political enablers of President Donald J. Trump will not increase accountability to the public interest --- instead it will increase total surrender to the whims of whatever Trump decides to do that day when he wakes up.  Career cirvil servants are necessary to actually permit the machinery of government to run.   Whether it be the FAA, the NIH, etc. people who know the science, who know the technology, who have experience administering important government services (such as people who work for the Social Security Administration or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) are necessary.

I believe this change is not only a bad idea but one that will seriously destroy the ability of the Federal government to effectively carry out its critical functions on behalf of the American people.

I am a retired Federal employee with about 30 years of service.  During that time I often reported directly to political employees who were nominated by the President and approved by the Senate.  And, I often worked with their Schedule C political special assistants. This included political employees of both Republican and Democratic Presidents.

I found, and I believe they found, the relationship between political level employees and career civil service employees to be a mutually beneficial working relationship.  The Presidentially-appointed employees sought to implement the policy direction of the Administration and the career employees sought to advise on how to do so...l

   Text sample: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has a statutory obligation to protect the merit system under federal law (5 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101 et seq.). Introducing Schedule F would erode this duty by exposing career civil servants to inappropriate political pressure, ultimately weakening the consistency and professionalism of government programs. The Schedule F initiative endangers fundamental principles of good governance, including an independent civil service and respect for the rule of law. Given these risks, I urge the administration and OPM to reject any efforts to move forward with this proposal.

Implementing Schedule F would lead to politicized employment decisions, contradicting the law's requirement for apolitical civil service. The broad and unclear criteria for Schedule F would also undermine due process rights, violating 5 U.S.C. ¬ß 7513, which demands cause and procedural safeguards for removing career employees. Depriving thousands of workers of these protections would harm account

   Text sample: The Trump administration proposed ‚ÄúSchedule F‚Äù (now renamed Schedule Policy/Career) is shorthand for an executive order that is a sharp break with civil service merit principles, which assume that career employees should be retained on the basis of performance and protected against political coercion. The US is already unusual in the degree to which it reserves the top layers of organizational leadership for short-term political appointees. Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections, the basic constraint against political interference.
The administration says that the purpose of Schedule F is to increase accountability for civil servants involved in policy-making. Set aside the fact that civil servants are accountable in multiple ways, Trump‚Äôs own justifications strike a more conspiratorial tone, including ‚Äúthe deep state c

   Text sample: I've read the verbose Schedule F proposal.  It is a very bad idea.  It would return a big piece of what is now the competitive civil service to the previous spoils system, a system with much incompetence and corruption.  Trump has already shown his definition of competence is loyalty to him.  Lacking competence himself, he has no criteria for defining competence, such as relevant experience, training, etc. I am opposed to this proposal.  Contrary to the myth you can't fire a federal employee, as a supervisor and program director in Federal Civil Service with the Dept. of Veterans Affairs over a 41+ year span of service I was responsible for the removal of 8 incompetent, and in one case criminal, civil service employees.  There is a process one must follow, which is as it should be to insure employees have rights to due process and a fair hearing if they appeal.

The continuity of expertise and experience of the Federal workforce under the civil service system helps to ensure the quality, stability and efficiency necessary to operate the agencies and provide the public services that are their mission. The system is designed to ensure that the work and priorities of each agency are set by the policies of top political leadership appointed by the President and confirmed by Congress when required, but the management and workforce who implement these policies have the kn

   Text sample: It is disturbing that this so-called 'Schedule F' rules change would seek to fire employees without cause or due process. Of course, such a rules change would further subject federal employees to the whims of self-interested politicians, rather than promote accountability or merit. Loyalty and adherence to the party line will curry favor while merit, knowledge, and efficiency will draw persecution. With a federal government politicized from top to bottom, actual governing will be replaced with brute domination, even as basic competency and responsibility falls by the wayside. On a purely pragmatic level, do we not want our planes to land safely? Do we not want weather forecasts to be free of political manipulation? Do we not want our customs and borders enforcement to be accountable to public scrutiny? Do we not want our diplomats and intelligence officers and government lawyers to operate as public servants rather than toadies? For all the worries of 'wokeness' taking over our bureauc

To the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),

I strongly oppose proposed rule RIN 3206-AO80 (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004) to reinstate "Schedule F." This rule reclassifies career civil servants as political appointees, threatening to institutionalize political loyalty tests and dismantle our nation's non-partisan, merit-based civil service‚Äîa cornerstone of effective U.S. governance for over a century. This dangerous proposal undermines good governance by:

Eroding Non-Partisan Civil Service: Public trust relies on a professional, non-partisan civil service ensuring continuity and impartial expertise. Politicizing these roles injects damaging partisanship, fosters a "culture of fear," and hinders employees from acting in the public's best interest, free from political pressure.

Violating Merit System Principles: The Pendleton Act (1883) mandated federal employment based on merit, not political affiliation

(OPM) proposed rule that would reclassify a significant number of federal employees,
potentially tens of thousands, into a new "Schedule Policy/Career" (Schedule P/C) or

nation's civil service and, by extension, to the quality of services provided to the

RE: Public Comment in Response to Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service [Docket No. OPM‚Äì2025‚Äì0004]

I am writing to express extreme concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions into political appointees. Doing so would erode necessary protections for those serving within the federal statistical system and transform positions which rely on specific expertise into political ones (with little to no expertise). 

The proposed rule, calls into question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for our economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and many other statistics. The federal statistical system plays an essential role in improving the lives of all Americans as well as informing critical policy decisions with evidence that is timely, relevant, and accurate. Federal statistical agencies are particularly vulnerable to the proposed rule due to the following:

Professional civil servants are the backbone of our nation, allowing a new administration to put in only loyal partisans affects the effectiveness of our civil government and as a result puts the US in danger.

Further, the Schedule F initiative endangers fundamental principles of good governance, including an independent civil service and respect for the rule of law

President Trump has supported a merit-based approach in Executive Order 14173. By allowing for the potential dismissal of career employees without cause, Schedule F would undermine the principles established by the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which aimed to end the spoils system and ensure hiring and promotion based on merit.

It would be a major step backward for the country and should be withdrawn.  The existing Civil Service system protecting government employees was adopted to address the widely perceived gross inefficiencies of the old patronage systems which often fostered corruption.  OPM should recognize the wisdom of our American forebearers in constructing the current Civil Service system, which has worked well to address the excesses of the patronage system.  Please add my voice to those opposing this misguided proposed rule!

   Text sample: I strongly oppose the proposed Schedule F or "Schedule Policy/Career" rule. As a scientific researcher, I know that the proposed rule will seriously damage U.S. science and innovation. Scientists are needed to evaluate and make decisions regarding science, not political appointees. Scientists can implement less biased standards to support the integrity, credibility, and scientific rigorousness of federally-funded science. This leads to better science to help mankind and advance human knowledge. This would be hamstrung by replacing career scientists.

   Text sample: As a retired federal employee I'm angered that the government wants to take away any grievance rights from any employee management or bargaining unit employees. Removing civil service protections from loyal hard working employees  is wrong. Protections from political interference is essential for the smooth operation of government agencies .   If one goes back to understand why the Pendelton  Civil Service Act was passed  after  President Garfield was shot the  leaders realized political pressures must be removed . This way civil servants could be kept free from political interference while performing their jobs.   Keep the civil service protections as they are now.   I remember how I was called into the office for something that I was charged with that happened on my day off. I had the right to a hearing , without any civil service protections employees would be thrown out with out ant rights.

   Text sample: I am greatly concerned by this rule, which includes simply removing a high level official for questioning a directive from the Executive Branch of the Government. The high level official should be an expert on the topic covered by the agency with many years of experience, which should be the reason the high-level official was appointed to this position in the first place. The said official should have the best interest of the American People at heart above else. The Government, on the other hand, may have good intentions but act under ill-informed motives, possibly more on ideological than pragmatic grounds. As stated in the proposed rule, political affiliation can not be ground for appointment or dismissal, but this rule is a slippery slop toward placing blind loyalty above all. I do agree that an official who is hindering the efforts of the Government should be removed if this is done simply for personal or political reason. However, the reasons for the official's decisions/actions should be heard (due process) and assessed by an independent panel of peers with the same expertise, similar experience, from different areas (if possible outside the Government) like academia and industry, who can evaluate the facts and provide an open report to the American People. We, the People, have a right to know why someone who has been appointed based on merit and expertise is suddenly no longer capable of meeting the goals of the Agency.
The section on Addressing Further Objections is not compelling and not supported by recent cabinet appointments being blatantly based more on loyalty than on merit and relevant expertise/experience.

   Text sample: The President's plan to implement Schedule F for civil servants in general and the NIH in particular is bad for the United States. 

The duties of civil servants should have a long time horizon. Retention of civil servants for their institutional knowledge, specialized expertise, and professionalism in the service of the United States is more valuable to the US taxpayer than allegiance to any political party or perceived indifference or even objection to the current administration. 

With regard to NIH, all Institute and Center Directors and their division directors and managers should be career civil servants and not become political appointees. In addition to politicizing the NIH, such a change would also increase the turnover of key positions, limiting longer-term planning and execution, increasing costs to the taxpayers and limiting what the NIH can achieve.

   Text sample: I am a federal employee submitting this comment in my personal capacity. 

I strongly oppose this proposed rule for the reasons articulated in a prior comment by Angel Reyes (Comment ID OPM-2025-0004-7584). Effective and efficient  government "depends on the ability of civil servants to offer independent legal and policy analysis without fear of political retaliation," but "[t]his rule would undermine that independence." Addressing poor performance in the civil service can be accomplished without the negative consequences of this proposed rule. Additionally, the rule does nothing to address alleged poor performance among the much larger number of employees who do not occupy positions of "confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character." The under- and over-inclusiveness of the rule raises doubts about whether addressing poor performance is really the focus of this proposal. Finally, the proposed rule does not adequately consider the importance of job stability in recruiting skilled professionals who could earn higher salaries in the private sector.

I urge OPM to withdraw the proposal and preserve the nonpartisan, expert-driven foundation of our civil service.

   Text sample: Civil servant positions are meant to be non-partisan.  Schedule F  will turn NIH employees that were formerly nonpartisan into political appointees- positions such as the Institute and Center and Division Directors.  This would politicize the NIH, and undoubtedly lead to increased turnover in positions due to them becoming quickly removeable at the whim of an unstable president.  This would also make the possibility of people who are exceeding unfit for the positions to take over, which is irresponsible and puts our country to shame. Political interference with grants assessment will destroy the scientific integrity of federal grants, and should never be an option.  Our country deserves consistent, intelligent people who are well prepared for their roles in the scientific community, and schedule F will only ensure that this never happens in the next 4 years.

While the stated intent is to increase accountability and streamline the removal of employees for misconduct or poor performance, the approach outlined threatens to politicize the federal workforce and undermine long-standing principles of merit-based civil service.

The federal workforce was deliberately designed to be nonpartisan and professionally insulated from political swings to ensure stable governance, scientific integrity, and the implementation of policies grounded in law‚Äînot political loyalty. This proposed rule blurs the critical line between policy and politics. It opens the door to at-will employment practices for roles that are explicitly nonpolitical in nature, such as scientists at the National Science Foundation, analysts at the Department of Energy, or economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These positions should not be subject to political whims simply because their expertise may inform or influence policy.

Labeling roles as ‚Äúpolicy-influencing‚Äù and then stripping them of due process protections sets a dangerous precedent. It effectively allows the executive branch to purge civil servants based on perceived disloyalty to a political agenda, rather than objective performance metrics. This undermines the very notion of a professional, apolitical civil service and invites abuse‚Äîparticularly during moments of partisan volatility.

If misconduct or poor performance is the concern, existing tools and procedures‚Äîwhen properly applied‚Äîare sufficient to address these issues. The problem is not with the rules; it‚Äôs with the inconsistent enforcement of them. Gutting job protections across a broad swath of the career workforce is a reckless overcorrection.

In short, accountability must not come at the expense of integrity. The solution to bureaucratic inefficiency is not political purging, but stronger management training, better supervision, and rigorous adherence to fair and consistent performance evaluation standards. The executive branch must not politicize the federal workforce‚Äîespecially in roles that require objectivity, evidence-based judgment, and continuity beyond election cycles.

I urge OPM to reject this proposal and instead uphold the merit principles that have long made the federal workforce a model of professionalism and stability.

   Text sample: Comment in Opposition to Office of Personnel Management Proposed Rule Changes 5 CFR Parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, and 752 [Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004] RIN 3206-AO80
Submitted By: Jon L Gelman Date: May 22, 2025
To the Office of Personnel Management,
I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule changes outlined in Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004, RIN 3206-AO80, pertaining to 5 CFR Parts 210, 212, 213, 302, 432, 451, and 752. While the stated intent of these regulations may be to enhance efficiency or streamline processes, my analysis indicates that the proposed changes, if implemented, would have detrimental effects on [choose one or more of the following, and elaborate]:
‚Ä¢	Employee Protections and Due Process: The proposed amendments appear to significantly weaken existing employee protections and due process rights, particularly concerning [mention specific areas, e.g., adverse actions, performance management, or appeals processes]. The removal or reduction of [cite specific sections or types of protections] would create an environment where federal employees are more vulnerable to arbitrary actions and less able to defend themselves against unsubstantiated claims. This undermines the principles of fairness and equity that are essential for a robust and ethical civil service.
‚Ä¢	Merit System Principles: I am concerned that these changes could erode the merit system principles designed to ensure fair and open competition for federal jobs and protection against political interference. [Elaborate on how specific changes might undermine merit, e.g., by broadening excepted service categories without sufficient justification, or by altering hiring processes in a way that favors patronage over qualifications]. A strong merit-based system is crucial for attracting and retaining the best talent for the federal government and for maintaining public trust.
‚Ä¢	Employee Morale and Retention: The proposed rules, by diminishing employee protections and potentially increasing job insecurity, are likely to have a profoundly negative impact on federal employee morale. A workforce that feels undervalued and vulnerable is less likely to be productive, innovative, and committed to their agencies' missions. Furthermore, these changes could significantly hinder the government's ability to recruit and retain skilled professionals, especially in critical fields where private sector opportunities are abundant. This could lead to a 'brain drain' within the federal service, ultimately harming the government's capacity to serve the American public effectively.
‚Ä¢	Agency Effectiveness and Stability: While some changes might be presented as efficiency measures, I contend that the long-term consequences of weakened employee protections could lead to decreased agency effectiveness. High turnover, low morale, and a less experienced workforce resulting from these changes would inevitably impact the continuity of operations and the ability of agencies to fulfill their mandates. Furthermore, a reduction in due process could lead to increased litigation and appeals, paradoxically creating new burdens and inefficiencies for agencies.
In conclusion, I urge the Office of Personnel Management to reconsider these proposed rule changes. The long-term health and effectiveness of the federal civil service depend on robust employee protections, adherence to merit system principles, and a commitment to fostering a fair and supportive work environment. These proposed regulations move in the opposite direction and threaten to undermine the very foundations of our dedicated federal workforce.
I respectfully request that OPM withdraw these proposed rules and engage in a more comprehensive and transparent process that genuinely seeks to strengthen, rather than weaken, the federal civil service.
Sincerely,
Jon L Gelman
Attorney at Law

Boca Raton FL 33431

   Text sample: I have first-hand experience from taking care of patients in other countries that have substandard healthcare systems. When the health-systems leadership changes following each new presidential election, this erases institutional experience and memory, and much-needed progress slows to a crawl. 

As I have experienced elsewhere, you can expect political appointees to hold the interests of the few over the great needs of the many. Unqualified appointees are placed in leadership positions. Patients and the general public suffer, not the politicians.

As a private citizen and an NIH-funded physician-researcher, I voice my disapproval of Schedule F. Where accountability needs to be improved, it is public servants who need to be accountable to the citizens of the USA, not to the Trump administration.

This proposal, along with the many other efforts by this administration, will disenfranchise Americans and divest in healthcare and the future wellbeing of all Americans and all other citizens of this Earth. I am strongly opposed to the politicalization of the NIH, NSF, and other research and science-focused organizations and institutes.

Re: ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,ÀÆ
Proposed Rule, 90 Fed. Reg. 17182. Docket ID. OPM. 2025. 0004
Dear Office of Personnel Management:

Anonymous submit(s) these comments regarding Office of Personnel Management ºs (OPM) Proposed Rule ‚ÄúImproving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,ÀÆ 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 April 23, 2025. I write to express opposition to the Proposed Rule.

As a worker (associate) at a federal facility (commenting under my own personal capacity by rights granted by the First Amendment of the United States constitution) I have experienced firsthand the ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù of this administration.  Changes that waste time and work hours (the 5-things email) and changes to procurement that make buying equipment and supplies many times more expensive and time-consuming.  These changes cripple the federal work force and do nothing to save tax dollars or improve the output of the government for the benefit of the country.  As such I am highly skeptical of any policy made to change federal rules proposed by the Trump administration.   

The proposed plan will make it easier to fire federal employees who are disloyal to the president by creating the ‚Äúschedule policy/career‚Äù label that removed the right to fight terminations (schedule F).  This fundamentally wrong as federal employees are not beholden to the whims of the president and have every under the constitution to oppose illegal or dangerous acts perpetrated by the government. Additionally, all federal workers make the following oath: 

‚ÄúI, ___, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.‚Äù

This oath it made to the constitution NOT to any administration or president.  This will make political loyalty more important that experience, skill and knowledge.  This means that American citizens will be at risk of injury or death should incompetent replacements or people to scared to speak out for fear of being fired.

I choose to work at a federal facility to do scientific research on behalf of the United States people and its industry.  National labs have some of the best facilities and smartest people on earth.  The opportunity to contribute to this was a dream come true.  My future plans had included becoming a federal employee at a national lab for the long term.  However, this plan has now been derailed, and this policy makes the prospect of working for the federal government extremely unappealing.  I am not alone in feeling this and the USA will lose many talented scientists should this policy be enacted.

In addition this policy relies on faulty data that do not adequately justify the changes for example, the policy references federal employee surveys asking about perceptions of poor performance and misconduct (ii. Proposed Regulations Are Necessary To Strengthen Democracy and Promote a Nonpartisan Civil Service), and cites a poll (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/23/2025-06904/improving-performance-accountability-and-responsiveness-in-the-civil-service#p-264) and anecdotal cases (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/23/2025-06904/improving-performance-accountability-and-responsiveness-in-the-civil-service#p-276) as evidence of widespread ‚Äúresistance‚Äù to Administration priorities. Contrary to what OPM claims, we expect these policies will lead to poor performance that is protected by political loyalty and to an increase in politically motivated and retaliatory firings under the guise of rooting out partisanship.

In conclusion I make this comment to highlight the problems in making the government more loyalty based and the failures of the rule to cite accurate evidence to support the changes.  

Thank you

   Issue: Not found in truncated text

   Text sample: While this rule is presented as a way to improve accountability and limit partisan or personal preferences from interfering with the official duties of Federal employees, it will in practice likely have the exact opposite effect.  It will remove protections for Federal employees who offer accurate analyses that may not match with the political agenda of the administration and create a political class not accountable to experts in the fields that influence their policies. Politicians should not be able to dictate what constitutes good science or accurate data analysis, and they shouldn't be able to dismiss anyone who disagrees with them to install sycophants more concerned with advancing agendas than skillfully performing their jobs. Further, creating a revolving door of Federal employees who stay or go based on who is in the White House will seriously undermine the overall quality of the civil service workforce and the skill and efficiency with which they deliver outcomes to the public.  

How do we know this will happen in practice? It already has. Probational Federal employees have been fired "for cause" when all previous performance reviews have been stellar. Grants have been terminated for "misalignment" with administration priorities in a manner that suggests nobody read past the title of the grant (or even the title of the grant program). Funding choices that represented the will of Congress and were determined by expert groups evaluators trained in the area they were evaluating and through a merit-based review of proposals have been reversed by nonscientists who do not seem to be doing much more than a key-word search for terms that offend the current administration. We need Federal employees who are experts in their areas and independent from political influence, and we need to allow them to do their jobs with independence, under the many systems that already exist for holding them accountable.

"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service" will do the opposite of what it claims.  It will hollow out our workforce of independent, competent civil servants.  It will substitute policy for good science.  It will set us back decades, making us less competitive, less nimble, and less able to attract and retain good Federal employees.  It will take us from the envy of the work in scientific research capacity and breakthroughs to unable to compete with other countries who maintain independent civil servants.  No to "Schedule F"!

   Text sample: Classifying all these federal workers as policymakers is a clear power grab to make them subject to presidential appointment and removal, thus rendering the federal government just a bunch of yes-men and yes-women to the executive branch. I particularly object to the proposed reclassification of "evaluators of grant applications" - this takes actual expertise (shock!), and cannot be done by partisan hacks. Please consider that the future of the country is at stake. We're getting rid of vaccines, a measles epidemic is exploding, we're exporting all our talent abroad, etc. The US is really at risk of losing its edge. Please maintain our standards of excellence. Do not do this.
