   QUOTE: "Introducing political instability through Schedule F would undermine the merit-based grant review process at NIH, including NEI; threaten evidence-based policymaking in public health and scientific agencies; disrupt career pathways for young scientists entering government service; cause significant staff attrition and institutional knowledge loss at federal agencies."

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   As a member of the vision research community and a supporter of
   evidence-based public policy, I write in strong opposition to the proposed
   rule that would enable the reclassification of federal employees into a new
   Schedule F category. This proposed rule would severely jeopardize the
   integrity and continuity of scientific research across the federal
   government, including at the National Eye Institute (NEI), where apolitical,
   expert leadership is essential to advancing breakthroughs in vision science
   and protecting the eye health of millions of Americans. Reclassifying career
   scientists, grant program staff, and policy experts under Schedule F would
   make it easier to dismiss qualified personnel for political reasons and
   insert partisan appointees into roles that should be guided solely by science
   and merit and that should maintain continuity from Administration to
   Administration. Vision research is a nonpartisan national priority. It leads
   to the development of new diagnostics, treatmen

   I am submitting these comments in opposition to the Office of Personnel
   Management’s (OPM) proposed regulation “Schedule Policy/Career.” The proposed
   rule undermines more than 140 years of civil service reform following the
   spoils system. It opens the door to politically motivated firings and
   tramples on employees’ constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, the
   proposed regulation to dismantle civil service protections destabilizes the
   career workforce, politicizes the day- to- day work of government, and erodes
   the very idea of a professional, independent civil service. Specific concerns

   QUOTE: "We strongly urge OPM to withdraw this rule immediately and preserve the nonpartisan, professional civilian corps that has safeguarded America’s national security for generations."

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   The Alliance for American Leadership, a bipartisan coalition of over 300
   national security experts and emerging leaders, firmly opposes the Office of
   Personnel Management’s (OPM) proposed reintroduction of “Schedule F.” This
   proposal threatens vital civil service protections, potentially affecting
   nearly 12,000 mission-critical civilians at the Department of Defense (DOD).
   According to the Congressional Research Service,* this proposed rule could
   reclassify approximately 11,910 senior-level DOD employees — including 3,300
   from the Army, 3,112 from the Navy, 1,592 from the Air Force, and 3,906 from
   other DOD entities — as at-will political appointees. Many affected
   individuals occupy GS-14/15 positions, equating in responsibility and
   authority to O-6 military ranks (Colonel or Navy Captain). These civilian
   leaders are indispensable to strategic planning, weapons systems acquisition,

   QUOTE: "The proposed reclassification of federal positions into Schedule Policy/Career represents a significant departure from the principles that have long safeguarded the integrity and effectiveness of the federal workforce."

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I am writing to express strong opposition to the Office of Personnel
   Management’s (OPM) proposed rule OPM-2025-0004-0001, which seeks to
   reclassify approximately 50,000 federal employees into a newly designated
   Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) category. This proposal, a revival of the
   previously rescinded Schedule F, threatens the foundational principles of a
   nonpartisan, merit-based civil service and poses significant risks to the
   integrity, efficiency, and accountability of federal operations. Erosion of
   Merit-Based Protections The cornerstone of the federal civil service is its
   commitment to merit-based hiring and retention, ensuring that employment
   decisions are grounded in qualifications and performance rather than
   political affiliation. By reclassifying positions into Schedule P/C, the
   proposed rule would strip affected employees of critical protections against
   arbitrary dismissal, effectively making them at-will employees. This

   QUOTE: "The proposed regulations to implement Schedule “Policy/Career” are contrary to law and pose a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and rule of law."

   TRUNCATED TEXT (999 characters):
   I strongly oppose creation of a Schedule “Policy/Career” for federal workers.
   This proposed regulation would decimate the merit-based civil service system
   that has underpinned a professional, non-partisan federal workforce for
   nearly 150 years. Merit-based federal employment means a more efficient
   government for American taxpayers and better public services for the American
   people. This proposed regulation would make our federal agencies less
   effective and expose the American public to the type of corruption that civil
   service laws were enacted to protect against. The creation of Schedule
   “Policy/Career” and the broad way in which it is being interpreted by the
   Office of Personnel Management (OPM) are contrary to Constitutional due
   process. It has long been recognized that non-probationary government workers
   are entitled to due process before they can be removed or have other
   employment actions taken against them. See Gilbert v. Homar, 520 U.S. 924,

   This order states Schedule Policy/Career employees: "are required to
   faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability,
   consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive
   authority solely in the President. Failure to do so is grounds for

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I oppose the proposed rule that would create a new “Schedule Policy/Career”
   category. Civil service protections were first introduced in the late
   nineteenth century in response to the “spoils” system whereby supporters of
   government officials were appointed to political offices. The main problem
   with that system was that it promoted corruption and inefficiency. Several
   civil service reform acts have been passed over the years to ensure
   government positions were filled by non-partisan, competent, and qualified
   civil servants. America needs a federal workforce that is professional,
   nonpartisan and can provide honest, evidence-based advice to policymakers
   without fear of political retaliation. Turning many career roles into at-will
   positions risks politicizing government operations and threatens the
   reliability of important public programs. Additionally, the rule states time
   and time again that this is not a mechanism by which federal employees can be

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I strongly oppose the proposed change, as it would grant the executive branch
   the authority to place political operatives in government positions. Although
   this change is framed as a way to make the federal workforce more efficient,
   it effectively turns federal workers into at-will employees who can be
   dismissed for vague reasons. We have already witnessed unjust firings based
   on vague claims of unsatisfactory performance, even for workers whose
   contributions were previously commended. There have been terminations for
   practicing transparency, for refusing to prioritize this administration over
   the American public, and for simply telling the truth. Everett Kelley,
   president of the American Federation of Government Employees, has remarked
   that this change 'will erode the government's merit-based hiring system and
   undermine the professional civil service that Americans rely on.' Our country
   was founded on the principle that hard work, expertise, distinction, and

   I strongly oppose OPM’s proposed regulation that would create a new "Schedule

   nonpartisan roles, it dangerously reclassifies them as at-will—stripping

   principles that ensure a professional, apolitical civil service. Career
   employees who are subject to removal without the right to appeal or due

   I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify

   TRUNCATED TEXT (999 characters):
   The proposed rule to weaken civil service protections risks creating
   significant operational inefficiencies and increased costs for federal
   agencies due to higher employee turnover and the loss of experienced staff.
   This instability will disrupt critical government functions, delay important
   projects, and burden agencies with costly legal challenges from wrongful
   termination lawsuits. Moreover, agencies responsible for national security
   and public safety depend on a stable, skilled workforce, and this rule
   threatens to undermine their effectiveness. Additionally, reduced job
   security and a hostile work environment will deter qualified professionals
   from joining or remaining in federal service, making it harder to recruit top
   talent in essential fields. Beyond these practical concerns, the
   administration should consider the potential political backlash and erosion
   of public trust that could result from alienating federal employees and
   citizens who rely on competent government services.

   Federal science should be driven by evidence, not political agendas. Schedule

   easier to suppress or distort research that doesn’t align with an
   administration’s views. It could also lead to political interference in
   federal research grants—redirecting funding based on ideology rather than
   scientific merit. Federal agencies depend on experienced scientific experts
   and data analysts with deep knowledge of complex systems. Under Schedule F,
   these experts could be removed en masse, resulting in (further) significant
   brain drain and the loss of institutional memory and technical expertise.
   Without civil service protections, scientists may feel pressured to
   self-censor or alter their findings to match political expectations. This
   would seriously damage the credibility and undermine integrity of government

   I am deeply concerned about the proposed Schedule F regulation and its
   potential to undermine the integrity of federal scientific institutions.
   Classifying NIH grantmaking roles—such as Institute and Center Directors—as
   “policymaking positions” subject to political appointment poses a serious

   change risks politicizing key scientific leadership roles, which could
   compromise merit-based grant decisions, lead to increased leadership
   instability, and disrupt the long-term planning that is essential for
   impactful research. Decisions about research funding should be grounded in
   scientific expertise and peer review, not political ideology. Enacting

   I am firmly against the introduction or reinstatement of the “Schedule F”
   employment classification for federal workers. This proposal endangers the
   merit-based civil service system that has sustained a competent, impartial
   federal workforce for more than a hundred years. At its core, Schedule F

   potentially dismissed without just cause, Schedule F paves the way for
   politically driven employment decisions. This contradicts the principle of a

   Here's why many citizens on both sides of the political discretion, are

   Undermining Merit-Based Hiring and Promotion: * Legal Basis: The Civil

   merit-based system for federal employment, emphasizing qualifications,
   competence, and political neutrality. This system aims to prevent patronage
   and ensure a skilled and professional civil service. * The Issue with
   Proposed Schedule F: Critics argue that creating a new Schedule F, which
   would reclassify certain federal employees as "excepted service" and remove
   some of their civil service protections, could open the door to political
   influence in hiring and firing. Positions could be filled based on political
   affiliation or loyalty rather than merit, potentially leading to a less

   I am submitting this comment on my personal time as someone who works in the
   federal workforce. I am extremely concerned about the damage this will do to
   workforce development in a number of fields the federal government hires for.
   Why would someone want to work for the federal government if there are no
   adverse action protections and the federal government pays less on average
   than the private sector? The reality is agencies already have a way to remove
   tenured competitive service employees who commit misconduct, perform poorly,
   or undermine democracy. At the same time, it seems difficult to appropriately
   define when a "position has been determined to be of a confidential,
   policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character." Current
   reports out of my own agency suggest that all employees within particular
   occupational series, despite their specific job duties, may be converted to

   TRUNCATED TEXT (999 characters):
   I oppose the proposed implementation. While OPM asserts that these positions
   will remain “career” and that their purpose is to reinforce accountability to
   the President, this distinction is ultimately unconvincing and fails to
   resolve core concerns about the erosion of the merit-based civil service.
   First, labeling a position as “career” while simultaneously making it subject
   to at-will dismissal based on subjective assessments of “faithful
   implementation” of a President’s agenda is a contradiction in terms. If these
   employees can be removed without the procedural protections afforded to
   others in the competitive service, then their career status is in name only.
   This change risks politicizing the federal workforce under the guise of
   neutrality, effectively chilling dissent and discouraging honest,
   evidence-based policy implementation. OPM's belief that codifying the
   distinction between political loyalty and implementation fidelity will reduce
   “misinformation” is optimistic at best.

   establish a new personnel category known as Schedule Policy/Career within the
   civil service. The stated aim is to enhance performance, accountability, and

   Dear Director Ahuja: I write to raise serious concerns with the cost-benefit
   analysis accompanying OPM’s proposed rule to establish “Schedule
   Policy/Career” in the excepted service. While this rule has been designated a
   “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866, its accompanying
   cost-benefit analysis does not meet the standards required for such actions.
   The analysis suffers from speculative assumptions, methodological gaps, and
   an absence of empirical support for projected benefits. 1. Unbalanced and
   Speculative Benefit Estimates The proposal suggests that the primary benefits
   of the rule stem from "increased accountability" and faster rulemaking due to
   improved employee performance. However, OPM acknowledges that it "does not
   have a reasonable basis for estimating the magnitude of these gains" and
   therefore does not quantify them​. These unquantified benefits are described
   as likely to “vastly outweigh” any administrative cost savings—yet no data or

   I. Introduction On its face, the initiative titled “Improving Performance,
   Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” purports to promote
   government efficiency. In practice, however, this policy operates as a
   constitutional wrecking ball—trampling First Amendment rights, undermining
   due process, violating the separation of powers, and inviting discriminatory

   I write in strong opposition to the proposed rule “Improving Performance,
   Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service” (RIN 3206 AO80),
   which would create a new “Schedule Policy/Career” excepted service
   classification. This proposed rule is deeply troubling for several reasons:
   1. Undermining Merit System Principles By reclassifying policy influencing
   positions as at will roles, this rule eviscerates long standing merit system
   protections. These positions would no longer be covered by Chapter 75 or 43
   of Title 5, eliminating due process rights and appeal protections. Such a

   the Civil Service Reform Act beyond their established interpretation, it
   creates a vague category that can encompass almost any white-collar employee
   and effectively nullifies civil service protections enshrined in law by
   Congress. Our democratic freedoms depend on the rule of law--that government

   Reform Act of 1883, which was established to eliminate patronage and create
   merit-based hiring processes. By allowing potentially tens of thousands of
   career civil servants with policy responsibilities to be reclassified and
   dismissed without established cause, Schedule F would effectively reintroduce
   a political spoils system. This contradicts the core principle of an
   apolitical civil service codified in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which requires
   federal employment decisions to be based on qualifications and protected from

   I strongly oppose this rule change, which greatly exaggerates the “problem”
   of poorly-performing government workers in order to replace tens of thousands
   of well-qualified, talented public servants with appointees who may be
   unwilling to place public good over blind loyalty to the executive branch.
   People may complain about specific instances in which this agency or that, or
   a particular government worker or another seemed inefficient or unresponsive.
   Of course this is occasionally going to occur when each year consists of
   millions of interactions between the public and the federal workforce. But to
   blow the frequency of unsatisfactory interactions out of proportion and,
   furthermore, pretend that more political appointees could improve the
   public’s experience is ludicrous. The main “problem” for government agencies
   today is that the public neither notices nor appreciates all the good that
   talented public servants perform. No one notices the cases of food poisoning

   From day one, the Trump administration and Elon Musk have unleashed an
   unprecedented assault on the federal workforce. Recently, this has included
   announcing intentions to cut 15% of U.S.-based State Department staff, 10,000
   jobs in the nation’s health care agencies, 80,000 Veterans Affairs positions,
   7,000 in the Social Security Administration, and tens of thousands more
   across the federal government. Meanwhile, President Trump has illegally fired
   heads of independent boards and agencies (in some instances, rendering these
   independent bodies unable to act), not to mention 17 inspectors general and
   the government’s chief ethics official and head of whistleblower
   protection—the watchdogs for good government. And in late March, Trump issued
   an executive order attempting to end workers’ collective bargaining rights at

   I strongly oppose the proposed changes outlined in "Improving Performance,
   Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service." While the proposal
   claims to enhance efficiency, it will have serious detrimental effects on the
   functioning of our civil service. The rule would foster a counterproductive
   culture of fear among civil servants. When employees operate under constant
   threat of punitive action, they become risk-averse. Under this rule,
   crucially important viewpoints as well as valuable mechanisms for problem
   solving will become incompatible with employee survival and advancement. The
   proposal overlooks numerous unintended consequences. Civil servants may
   prioritize short-term metrics over long-term public benefit, avoid necessary
   but politically sensitive work, and experience decreased morale and increased
   turnover—ultimately undermining the very performance improvements sought.
   Most concerning is that these changes are fundamentally incompatible with

   Turning thousands of policy-related roles into at-will positions undermines

   Detrimental Effects of the Proposed Rule on Civil Service Performance and
   Accountability 1. Introduction: The Perils of Politicizing the Civil Service
   The proposed rule, published in the Federal Register on April 23, 2025 1,
   seeks to implement Executive Order 14171 and establish a new personnel
   category known as Schedule Policy/Career within the civil service. The stated
   aim is to enhance performance, accountability, and responsiveness within the
   federal workforce.1 However, this initiative, which reinstates and amends the
   previous Schedule F executive order 2, presents a significant threat to the
   foundational principles of a merit-based, nonpartisan civil service. This
   report argues against the implementation of this rule, asserting that it
   undermines the established merit system, erodes job security for dedicated
   career professionals, risks increased politicization and a decline in

   While the goal of improving performance, accountability, and responsiveness
   in the civil service is commendable, the proposed reforms often overlook the
   unique challenges faced by veterans transitioning into federal employment.
   Many policies fail to address systemic inefficiencies that disproportionately
   hinder veterans, despite their proven leadership and technical skills. Here’s
   why the current approach falls short: 1. Veterans Face Structural Barriers to
   Performance Civil service reforms frequently emphasize "performance metrics"
   without acknowledging bureaucratic hurdles that stifle veterans’
   productivity. Lengthy security clearance delays, redundant training programs,
   and inflexible hierarchies often prevent veterans from applying their

   I am writing to express strong opposition to the proposed Executive Order and
   accompanying rule changes by the Office of Personnel Management that would
   reclassify many career civil servant positions, such as program officers and
   program directors, into political appointments. This policy threatens to
   fundamentally undermine the integrity, objectivity, and continuity of
   scientific research and public service in the United States. Science, by its
   very nature, must remain nonpartisan and rooted in empirical evidence,
   rigorous peer review, and long-term perspective. The proposed changes would
   allow for the dismissal of scientific experts based not on performance or
   ethics, but for political disagreement. This creates an environment in which
   critical research on public health, education, the environment, and
   innovation could be manipulated—or suppressed entirely—to fit transient
   political agendas rather than serving the public interest. Federal program

   civil servants shouldn’t be forced to become Trump loyalists to keep their
   jobs From day one, the Trump administration and Elon Musk have set out to
   punish federal employees in unprecedented and illegal ways. From attempting
   to disregard federal employees’ union rights to initiating mass layoffs and
   placing other employees on administrative leave to halt the work of their
   agencies, they have tried to take a hacksaw to important government services
   and the people who provide them. And this is no surprise – Trump’s head of
   the government operations agency, Russell Vought, also the architect of the
   right-wing policy playbook Project 2025, once said he wanted federal

   QUOTE: "Reinstating Schedule F would mark a regression to partisan patronage, destabilize the professional capacity of government, and erode the foundational principle that government should serve the people, not a political party."

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   Schedule F proposal is detrimental to American democracy. The idea of
   reinstating Schedule F represents one of the most dangerous threats to the
   integrity of the United States federal government in modern times. At its
   core, Schedule F would politicize vast swaths of the career civil service,
   stripping essential job protections from thousands of federal employees whose
   primary qualifications are expertise, impartiality, and a commitment to
   public service, not political loyalty. The American civil service system,
   built over a century, was designed explicitly to shield public administration
   from partisan manipulation. This reform traces directly back to the Pendleton
   Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, enacted in response to rampant political
   patronage and corruption during the so-called spoils system.The Pendleton Act
   replaced cronyism with a merit-based hiring system, protecting the government
   from becoming a revolving door of political loyalists and ensuring that

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   While this proposal provides the legal rationale, the how-to is missing.
   Typically, proposals often reference guidance documents to explain how the
   proposal is to be implemented. This proposal states that a workplace culture
   that prizes “frank and fearless advice to agency leadership” is desired. I
   hope that is true, but without the guidance on how Schedule Policy/Career is
   to be implemented, I have too many questions. A person working under this
   schedule may need to be very careful. Sometimes the employee might need to
   make a split-second decision on speaking up or remaining silent. Sometimes,
   that will be easy – the supervisor calls a meeting and states that the
   purpose of the meeting is to provide input/advice. Discussion proceeds until
   the supervisor states some version of “Do it this way.” Then, at that

   As a former Social Studies teacher at the high school level, I am very
   concerned about President Trump's proposal to remove 50,000 civil servants
   from the merit-based selection system. There is a reason the Pendleton Act of
   1883 was passed: a spoils system for federal jobs meant that many unqualified
   and lazy supporters of the President were rewarded with jobs. Because current
   civil service employees cannot easily be terminated and replaced with a
   President's friends or relatives, many civil servants are employed for
   decades and have a wealth of knowledge about the program they administer.
   This knowledge base can be lost if every President fires the previous
   President's appointees in order to bring in loyalists in their place. The
   President already has many high level officials (Cabinet members and others)
   that he or she can appoint in order to have government leaders who generally

   pave the way for a modern-day spoils system by facilitating the

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   As a retired employee with 30+ years of experience in federal government, I
   strongly oppose this proposed rule. The rationale for the rule is that many
   in federal service believe that it is too difficult to fire underperforming
   employees. Further, there are multiple examples of employees, regardless of
   competence, opposing or resisting the implementation of policies determined
   by an Administration with no consequence. As I understand it, the proposed
   solution to these problems is to create a new class of excepted service
   employees, mostly consisting of employees involuntarily classified from
   competitive positions. These reclassified employees would not be provided any
   means of challenging their reclassification and could be fired at will from
   their new positions. This problem is compounded by the considerable
   discretion that agencies are given in determining the particular positions
   that are subject to reclassification. A central reason for having a

   TRUNCATED TEXT (999 characters):
   The proposal creates significant challenges to the core principles of a
   merit-based civil service. Reclassification of positions into Schedule
   Policy/Career without traditional civil service protections allows for
   politicization of roles that operate in a nonpartisan manner. This undermines
   the impartiality and expertise essential to effective governance. The policy
   permits agencies to reclassify positions without notifying affected employees
   nor does it provide avenues for appeal. This absence of transparency and due
   process compromises employee rights and negatively impacts morale and trust.
   Eliminating procedural safeguards will lead to politicization of positions
   that influence policy. This results in decisions driven by political
   considerations rather than objective analysis and expertise. This will also

   I oppose this proposed rule to convert certain federal employees to Schedule
   Policy/Career for two reasons. FIRST, the proposed Schedule Policy/Career
   rule is arbitrary and capricious because the remedy (converting

   connection to the stated problem (difficulty removing officials for

   strengthen employee accountability and the democratic responsiveness of
   American government, while addressing longstanding performance management
   challenges in the Federal workforce. Thus, according to the proposal, (a)
   employees who perform well and faithfully implement the President's agenda to

   I'm very concerned about the proposed rule and think it would be a troubling
   change in policy. There are two main reasons that I think this proposed rule
   is a terrible idea: Although it portends to make employees more accountable
   to their assigned work objectives, in fact it would make them less
   accountable to their work and more accountable to the whims of the executive
   branch leader, the President. There are reasons why federal employees are not
   currently "at will" employees - because it helps them be insulated from
   political calculations and allows them to be loyal to the assigned work. Why
   does this matter? It matters because the MOST important quality of an
   employee is their merit. Do they have the knowledge and skills to do the job
   well? This rule would instead make the most important characteristic of a
   federal employee their loyalty to the President. Federal employees do not
   work for the president, they work for the American people. There was a time

   During my time working in the federal government, I observed 100’s of my
   fellow workers striving to accomplish the agency mission without regard to
   their party affiliation or their personal political philosophy. Although I
   was friendly with many supervisors, I never observed nor heard of a
   supervisor frustrated by the inability to fire an underperforming employee.
   Supervisors presently have adequate authority to address underperforming
   employees. Enabling the firing of employees “for poor performance or
   misconduct, such as corruption or for injecting partisanship into the
   performance of their official duties.” will inject partisanship into the
   federal workforce. The rationale for this rule is bogus and the impact will
   decrease the effectiveness of the federal workforce. It will amplify the

   Institutionalizing politicized science Donald Moynihan and Pamela Herd The

   personal sacrifices for the greater good, and worked long hours,

   The ongoing push to fire federal workers is deeply misguided and harmful to

   I oppose the proposed Schedule F classification. As a retired Federal
   employee I know that a professional, stable, knowledgeable, non-partisan
   civil service is to a well-functioning government. Career employees smooth
   the transitions between administrations. This new proposal would violate the
   Civil Service Reform Act protections against arbitrary dismissal. The
   language and history of the CSRA provides only very narrow exceptions for
   positions of a “confidential or policy-determining character.” I do not
   understand how the unprecedentedly broad interpretation of the statutory
   language could be consistent with the statutory language, legislative
   history, or caselaw concerning this narrow exception to the CSRA's broad
   civil service protections. The proposed regulations remove this longstanding
   and important protection without justification or due process. The Federal

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   OPM’s proposed rule to reintroduce a modernized version of “Schedule F” under
   the name “Schedule Policy/Career” poses a direct threat to American
   democracy, the public interest, and the foundational integrity of the federal
   civil service. By enabling the removal of key civil servants from established
   due process protections, the rule would create a broad class of at-will
   government employees in vaguely defined “policy-influencing” roles. This
   would effectively strip thousands of career professionals of the procedural
   safeguards that uphold merit-based employment, exposing them to dismissal
   based on ideological differences or political disfavor. In doing so, it
   revives the dangerous logic of the spoils system the U.S. overwhelmingly
   rejected over a century ago. The justifications for this rule are not only
   flawed—they are deeply misleading. OPM claims that the rule is necessary to
   restore merit-based employment, but in reality, it does the opposite.

   The proposed Schedule F stated goal is to keep employees from “injecting

   political appointees and Schedule C employees take considerable time to come
   up to speed to understand their jobs and the breadth and complexity of their
   departments so that they can make reasonable and informed decisions on
   leading their departments. Adding an additional layer of political appointees

   working in senior positions at the Department of Energy Headquarters in

   This rule is a sharp break with civil service merit principles, which assume

   protections, the basic constraint against political interference. The
   administration says that the purpose of this rule is to increase
   accountability for civil servants involved in policy-making. Set aside the

   QUOTE: "Simply put, allowing scientific grantmaking Federal employees to be Schedule Policy/Career employees subject to the volatile and transitory political forces of any presidential administration will destroy scientific integrity and render it impossible to either train quality scientists or to develop and benefit from scientific and medical discoveries."

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I am writing to argue that scientific grant-making federal employees should
   never be classified as Schedule Policy/Career positions, and further that
   none of the justifications for this rule change described as “resistance”
   apply to or concern the methods or people employed in scientific research
   grantmaking. As described, Schedule Policy/Career positions require federal
   employees to "implement administration policies to the best of their ability,
   consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive
   authority solely in the President." (Section 1.B.2) This direction is
   inappropriate for anyone with “substantive participation and discretionary
   authority in agency grantmaking, such as the substantive exercise of
   discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation
   of grant applications, or recommending or selecting grant
   recipients.”(Section 1.B.2) Scientific research is a slow, laborious

   American citizens rely on our federal government for disaster relief, weather

   research. Such research investments often pay off for decades, often in the
   form of economic prosperity. I offer an example from my own life. Since 1996,

   The proposed rule of converting policy-related positions to schedule F,
   states the following: "These positions will remain career jobs filled on a

   employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly,

   rule contradicting itself by indicating it wants to have career jobs filled
   on a non-partisan basis, meaning the employee should be providing the best
   guidance and counsel based on knowledge, expertise and current laws, but then

   Respectfully, switching career civil service employees to an at-will

   (OPM) proposed rule titled “Improving Performance, Accountability and
   Responsiveness in the Civil Service” (Docket OPM-2025-0004). The rule would

   Legal Argument Against OPM’s Schedule F NPRM (April 2025) The Office of
   Personnel Management’s (OPM) April 23, 2025, NPRM establishing “Schedule
   Policy/Career” (Schedule F) violates federal law, exceeds executive
   authority, and undermines the merit-based civil service. By reclassifying
   career civil servants as at-will employees without protections under 5 U.S.C.
   §§ 4303 and 7513, the rule contravenes the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA)
   and judicial precedent. Reclassifying employees not hired into Schedule F
   further violates due process and accrued rights. Argument 1: Schedule F
   Violates Statutory Intent and Precedent Schedule F misinterprets the CSRA’s
   excepted service exemptions, limited to “confidential, policy-determining”
   roles (5 U.S.C. § 2103). United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439 (1988),
   underscores Congress’s intent to protect career employees from arbitrary
   dismissal. Lovshin v. Department of Navy, 767 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985),

   Schedule Policy/Career: An Assault on Expertise, Integrity, and Democratic

   without due process, particularly those involved in policy formulation. This
   is not simply a restructuring—it is a calculated effort to purge expertise,
   suppress dissent, and consolidate power by targeting those who best
   understand the workings of government. Firing the Capable and Informed At the
   heart of this policy is a deeply troubling trend: the removal of smart,
   capable, and experienced professionals. These individuals are not political

   Legal Challenge to Proposed Regulation on "Improving Performance,

   misconduct or poor performance, the mechanism it proposes would dramatically
   undermine the longstanding tradition of civil service independence. By
   allowing agency supervisors to easily dismiss career employees in
   policy-influencing positions for reasons not constrained by established civil

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   At will employment for federal employees too easily risks shaping the
   government into biased, unquestioning servitude to partisan politics. It
   would massively destabilize the effectiveness of the entire federal
   government as populations of federal employees are systematically replaced in
   favor of sycophants who would resist the will of executive office should
   control of the presidency change hands from one party to another.
   Additionally, federal employees have been facing increased undue criticism,
   declining benefits, and lower pay than their private sector counterparts.
   Removing the protections on federal employees will leave no true benefits of
   working for the federal government aside from a patriotic dedication to one's
   country. Continuing to degrade the standard of living of the populace reduces
   ones patriotism to the country, removing even that benefit from recruitment
   and making recruitment near impossible without further making life worse in

   Just as with most recent bills, the name says just the opposite of what it

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I strongly oppose this rule for the following reasons: 1. Undermines the
   Merit System and Nonpartisanship The creation of a new “Schedule
   Policy/Career” category effectively revives the discredited Schedule F scheme
   by reclassifying career policy positions as at‑will. This shift removes
   procedural protections under 5 U.S.C. Chapters 43 and 75, inviting political
   influence into roles that must remain nonpartisan to ensure objective policy
   implementation. 2. Circumvents Statutory Safeguards Congress has consistently
   protected career civil servants from arbitrary removal to preserve expertise
   and institutional memory. The Administrative Procedure Act and Civil Service
   Reform Act establish clear appeals processes; this rule seeks to bypass those
   safeguards without congressional authorization, risking legal challenges and
   executive overreach. 3. Chills Whistleblowing and Oversight By permitting

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   It's deeply concerning to consider the implications of a federal rule that
   would dismantle the professional civil service and replace it with a
   patronage system, reminiscent of the Schedule F proposal. Such a move would
   fundamentally undermine the principles of merit-based hiring and retention
   that have long been the bedrock of an effective and impartial government.
   Converting professional civil servants into political appointees who can be
   fired "at will" opens the door to potential politicization of crucial
   government functions, eroding the expertise and continuity that career
   professionals bring. Here in California, we understand firsthand the vital
   importance of a robust and high-quality state civil service. Our dedicated

   I respectfully urge OPM to withdraw its proposed “Improving Performance,

   conflicts with established statutory protections, violates due process, and
   undermines the merit-based civil service system enshrined in the Civil

   Act (CSRA) of 1978 The CSRA (5 U.S.C. §§ 4301-4305, 7511-7514) ensures that
   federal employees may only be removed or disciplined for cause, with
   procedural protections including the right to appeal adverse actions to the
   Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The proposed rule creates a new
   “Schedule Policy/Career” category that exempts employees from Chapters 43 and

   I have worked at FDA for almost a decade, and I have been a supervisor at the
   agency for nearly five years. The proposed rule states that supervisors in
   the federal government report "great difficulty removing employees for poor
   performance or misconduct." This is not the case within FDA. We have
   terminated employees in my operating unit for poor performance, and my
   colleagues in other operating units have terminated employees for misconduct.
   Federal employees have civil service rights; therefore, proper documentation
   of poor performance or misconduct is necessary, as is following formal
   procedures when removing an employee. Nevertheless, removing employees for
   poor performance or misconduct happens, and it happens without "great
   difficulty" as the proposed rule suggests. The proposed rule cites surveys
   that indicate some federal employees perceive that poor performers are dealt
   with inadequately and some supervisors believe the process for removing poor
   performers is "discouraging.

   comment addresses the proposed rule to reestablish an excepted service

   Employees who are part of a recognized bargaining unit should be

   I write to express deep concern and strong opposition to the proposed
   regulation, which would convert many federal civil service positions into
   at-will roles, enabling swift removals and political replacements. While
   presented as a reform to enhance accountability, this proposal threatens to
   severely undermine the integrity, functionality, and long-term stability of
   the federal government. Critically, this policy could backfire on the very
   administration that seeks to implement it—not after a future election, but
   even before. By enabling the mass dismissal of experienced, merit-based
   professionals and encouraging the installation of ideologically aligned
   loyalists, this rule would destabilize agencies that require continuity,
   technical skill, and deep institutional knowledge to function. Federal

   (formerly Schedule F) classification, poses a significant threat to the
   integrity of the federal civil service and the protections afforded to career
   federal employees. Erosion of Due Process Protections The proposed rule would
   allow for the reclassification of numerous policy-influencing positions into
   the Schedule Policy/Career category, effectively stripping affected employees
   of critical due process rights. Under this classification, employees could be
   terminated without notice, cause or the ability to appeal, undermining the
   merit-based principles that have long been the foundation of the federal
   workforce.

   Public Comment Opposing the Establishment of Schedule Policy/Career Authority
   Submitted by: Former Federal Employee To Whom It May Concern: I respectfully
   submit this comment in strong opposition to the establishment of the
   “Schedule Policy/Career” classification under Executive Order 14171. While
   framed as a tool for accountability, this authority undermines civil service
   protections, politicizes public administration, and destabilizes
   constitutional governance. Though renamed, Schedule Policy/Career mirrors the
   intent of the rescinded Schedule F and presents even greater risks by

   I am submitting this comment regarding regulations proposed by the Office of
   Personnel Management (OPM) Docket ID OPM-2025-0004, RIN 3206-AO80. The
   proposed regulations seek to remove civil service protections from a new
   class of federal workers called Schedule Policy/Career (P/C) and make these
   workers at-will employees. The proposed regulations state that the President
   would have sole authority to reclassify employees as P/C and that such
   employees would lose the ability to challenge the reclassification. The
   rationale for the proposed regulations is to allow the "quick removal" of
   employees from critical positions who "engage in misconduct, perform poorly
   or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential
   directives." I am a retired state government employee who worked in state
   government as an attorney, both as a civil service employee and as an exempt

   I strongly oppose the implementation of the proposed Schedule F rule. As a

   deeply concerned about the threat this rule poses to the integrity and

   a critical role in evaluating scientific grant proposals. This change would
   open the door to political interference in a process that must remain
   impartial and evidence-based. Grant decisions are not political acts. Rather,
   they are determinations of scientific merit made by subject-matter experts
   and trained professionals who follow rigorous, peer-reviewed evaluation

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   The primary reason given for implementing Schedule F is that “Agency
   supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance
   or misconduct.” How does this comport with the administration laying off
   120,000 federal employees (many of who had just received outstanding
   performance reviews from superiors) in 100 days? Many of those employees who
   went public with their stories said the official reason they had been
   terminated was for “poor performance,” when a month earlier their performance
   reviews said they were exceeding expectations. Given that the administration
   didn’t seem to have a problem removing large swaths of the federal workforce,
   why are we focused on finding ways to make it even easier to remove federal
   employees? It’s not for efficiency reasons - many positions that were
   eliminated were added back, and many roles that were vacated by people who
   took the severance package through September needed to be filled again.

   walked sterile halls, whispered warnings no one wanted to hear, filed reports
   no one wanted to read, and carried laws on their backs like lanterns in the

   called it Schedule Career/Policy. Just enough words to sound important, just
   vague enough to sound harmless. The rule allowed truth to be silenced gently,
   professionally, without fuss. It gave permission to power—not the honest
   kind, but the sort that curls inward like smoke. It allowed those who served

   I am a current federal employee with over a decade of service in a complex

   First, the rule as written will result in a loss of expertise and

   Implementing the directive in a way that, while technically compliant,

   After reviewing the proposed rule, there appear to be significant

   protections for employees in those positions. The U.S. Supreme Court has

   due process is necessary to determine if that cause has been met. Neither

   procedural rules that are being changed here were enacted to help ensure that
   adverse actions are taken in accordance with the Constitution and for proper
   cause. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees that no person
   shall "be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I am a federal employee who is concerned about the overacting issues with
   this proposed rule. The principle of separation of powers, as outlined in the
   U.S. Constitution, establishes a system of distinct roles and
   responsibilities for the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. This
   principle, along with the system of checks and balances, aims to prevent any
   single branch from accumulating excessive power. The proposed rule, which
   seeks to alter the employment status and procedural rights of certain federal
   employees, raises concerns about whether it oversteps the boundaries of
   executive authority and encroaches upon the legislative domain. Congress has
   historically played a significant role in defining the terms and conditions
   of federal employment. Through legislation such as the Civil Service Reform
   Act, Congress has established the rights and protections of federal
   employees, including the procedures for adverse actions and appeals. These

   As a current federal employee, the proposed rule's reliance on the term
   "policy-influencing positions" as the basis for altering the employment

   undefined scope – the rule fails to provide specific criteria or standards

   TRUNCATED TEXT (999 characters):
   Schedule F describes its stated purpose as to "allow agencies to quickly
   remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform
   poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting
   Presidential directives". However, it seems unlikely that the proposed rule
   will have this effect. A core principle of democracy in the United States is
   the system of checks and balances. Numerous Presidential directives have been
   identified as unconstitutional or in opposition to the democratic process by
   legislators, courts, the general public, or all three. It is not necessarily
   the case that compliance with all Presidential directives will be the most
   effective way to ensure the stability of the democratic process. For example,
   if the President were to issue an Executive Order declaring that federal
   elections will be suspended and current office-holders will retain their
   posts indefinitely, then non-compliance with the Presidential directive would

   I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule titled
   “Career Civil Service Protections for Policy-Determining, Policymaking, or

   Policy/Career” federal employment classification. This proposal would
   undermine long-standing civil service protections by allowing sweeping
   reclassification of federal employees into an “at-will” employment status,
   where they could be terminated without cause or due process. Such a change
   would violate the principles of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which
   was enacted to ensure that federal employees are hired and retained based on
   merit, not politics. The proposed rule is excessively broad and vague. The
   term “policy-influencing” is undefined and open to expansive interpretation,
   potentially covering tens of thousands of employees — including career

   I write as a scientist and science educator. During my 40 year career I have
   had many interactions with personnel at the major federal agencies and
   institutes that support basic scientific research - especially NIH, NSF, and
   USDA. I have received federal funding in support of my research, provided
   peer reviews for countless proposals, served on review panels, and mentored
   undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers receiving
   federal support for their education and research. I have believed for decades
   that the strength and success of the US research endeavor - I think it is
   fair to say that we have led the global scientific community for decades -
   arose in major part because of the lack of political interference in grants
   assessment and the overall integrity of the award process. The nonpartisan

   I am opposed to the federal rule change proposing to abolish the federal
   civil service and replacing it with what is basically a patronage system. As
   a former Professor of American history, I have researched and taught the
   history of this country, including civics, for decades. This proposed rule
   change is precisely NOT what the founding fathers wanted -- in fact, it is
   exactly what they attempted to prevent while writing the Constitution.
   Supporters of Schedule F have proposed converting 50,000 career civil
   servants into political appointee status. That is a massive degree of
   additional politicization, and the most fundamental change to the civil
   service system since its inception in 1883. Increasing the number of
   political appointees would create a new venue where political polarization
   would undermine the quality of governance by replacing moderates with

   1. Legal Authority and Statutory Interpretation The proposed rule appears to
   conflict with established statutory protections under Title 5 of the U.S.
   Code, particularly Chapters 43 and 75, which govern performance-based actions
   and adverse actions, respectively. By reclassifying positions into Schedule
   P/C and removing these protections, OPM may be exceeding its regulatory
   authority, as these statutes were enacted by Congress to ensure fair
   treatment of federal employees. The abrupt removal of due process rights
   without clear legislative backing could be deemed ultra vires and subject to
   legal challenge. 2. Administrative Procedure Act (APA) Concerns The APA
   mandates that rulemaking be based on substantial evidence and reasoned

   It is the purpose of government employees to serve the American public. It is
   my belief that government employees take their responsibility to serve the
   public very seriously. It is not the responsibility of government employees
   to only serve the desires of the president as proposed in Schedule F. The
   president has taken an oath to represent everyone in the country. Those
   serving under him are expected to do the same. The President is not a king
   and those working in the government are not his personal servants. In my
   experience, government employees are highly educated and dedicated to serving
   their respected agencies. It is my understanding that current employees are
   high performers in their positions and many have institutional memory, which
   also adds value to the problem-solving and decision-making processes of their
   agencies.

   TRUNCATED TEXT (999 characters):
   This rule making has multiple legal and practical issues with moving forward.
   The statutory language of the civil service reform act for the exception for
   policy making employees only applies to those not in the competitive service.
   To extend this to employees that have been hired through the competitive
   service is a clear violation of the statute. Congress clearly intended the
   Civil Service Reform Act’s exemption from protections to apply only to
   policy-making employees hired outside the competitive service. OPM issued a
   rule making just last year in 2024 that protected civil service rights to
   workers and clarified this. Now, less than a year later, the same agency is
   interpreting the exact same statute in a completely different way with this
   updated rule making. Even if one accepts that there is ambiguity in the
   statutory language, in light of the Chevron decision, OPM as a federal agency
   does not have sole authority to determine interpretation of the statute.

   I am commenting re OPM-2025-0004, RIN 3206-AO80. Federal acquisition
   personnel are responsible for complying with a plethora of laws and
   regulations that have been put into place to ensure accountability and to

   they often must resist pressure from agency leadership and outside vendors to
   protect the integrity of the procurement process. Without the protections
   that come with being non-partisan, career civil servants, these employees
   would not be able to enforce these high standards. They would be coerced to

   I am opposed to the rule that would allow career civil servants to be
   replaced with political appointees. David Lewis finds in his 2008 book The
   Politics of Presidential Appointments that appointees are less competent than
   career civil servants. The bureaucracy would not only lose integral

   A significant number of the existing 4,000 presidential appointees remain

   with a growth in the number of appointed positions. Increased vacancies will
   result in a decrease in bureaucratic capacity and efficiency. Bolton,

   Legal and Constitutional Concerns - The proposed rule, which effectively
   revives and expands the concept of "Schedule F" (here named "Schedule

   a professional, apolitical civil service. By making thousands of
   policy-influencing positions "at-will," the rule directly contradicts the
   Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which established merit-based
   hiring to end patronage. - The reclassification strips employees of
   procedural protections guaranteed under the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA)
   and the Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912, both of which require just cause and
   due process for terminations. The Supreme Court has affirmed in Cleveland

   I am a concerned citzen who strongly opposes the administration's proposed
   changes to weaken competitive hiring rules for career federal employees. If
   these rules are weakened or eliminated, the civil service, one of the great
   strengths of our American system, will become politicized and toxic. Its
   members would be hired not for their skills or knowledge or experience, but
   their ideological and political loyalties. Career civil servants are the
   backbone of federal agencies, providing stability and continuity across
   changing administrations. My father-in-law was one such civil servant,
   faithfully serving the Bureau of Labor Statistics for more than three
   decades. Had he been treated as a political appointee, rather than the
   dedicated civil servant he was, the Bureau and the nation would have been
   worse off for not having had his service. We are already seeing the
   devastating consequences of entrusting critical government responsibilities

   The historical analysis is misleading. From your own account, shortly after

   You are suggesting that presidential appointees can fire a policy employee
   (why are you picking on policy employees?) without cause. Cause is reason, so
   without reason. That's not okay. They need cause to show there was actually a
   problem and it's not just a termination based on personal bias... and it

   TRUNCATED TEXT (999 characters):
   As an American citizen I find this proposed rule to be patently offensive,
   blatantly corrupt, and intentionally designed to subvert the Constitution and
   the people who serve the public through civil service. The only purpose of
   this proposed rule is to dismantle checks and balances against the
   President's unbridled pursuit of power and to push an agenda that robs power
   from the public, whom the President is supposed to serve. If this rule is
   implemented, there will be no improvement in performance, no improvement to
   accountability, and a distinct lack of responsiveness in the civil service.
   In fact, every aspect of the Federal workforce will suffer, and thus will
   attract only those who grovel the lowest at the President's feet or those who
   ruthlessly climb over the backs of others in pursuit of whatever power
   fantasy the President dangles in front of them. Gone will be the dedicated,
   patriotic, proud, loyal (to the US Constitution), and hard working people

   I am an epidemiologist with experience applying for research funding at NIH

   following section of the proposed rule to be quite worrisome: "Substantive
   participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking, such as the
   substantive exercise of discretion in the drafting of funding opportunity
   announcements, evaluation of grant applications, or recommending or selecting
   grant recipients. Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so
   employees with a substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets
   allocated may occupy policymaking positions." The plain meaning is that
   grantmaking responsibilities should effectuate the policy of the
   administration, justifying the replacement of civil servant experts with
   political appointees. Science and research succeed in a context of rigorous

   rule undermines more than 140 years of civil service reform following the
   spoils system. It opens the door to politically motivated firings and

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I think it is deeply problematic to make it easier to fire federal employees.
   Expertise is built over time, but political winds can shift quickly. Our
   federal workforce is effective because of the certainty that they can
   continue their work on behalf of the American people, despite changes in
   administration. Further, Federal workers have accepted lower pay than they
   could earn in the private sector because of the certainty that they will be
   able to keep their job in the Federal government as long as they continue to
   perform their duties. Removing these protections will make it harder for the
   federal government to hire the most qualified individuals for the job.
   Finally, administrations can demand workers carry out duties that are on
   conflict with the law. Workers should be able to plainly refuse to carry out
   such orders, but this law could result in retaliation or removal of the
   employee for upholding the law. Federal worker protections have ben hard won

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I am commenting to express my strong opposition to the implementation of the
   “Schedule F” classification for federal employees. The proposal would
   significantly weaken the merit-based foundation of the civil service system,
   which has upheld a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for more than
   a hundred years. The Office of Personnel Management is statutorily charged
   under 5 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq. with protecting and promoting merit system
   principles. Schedule F runs directly counter to this mission. By
   reclassifying career civil servants—particularly those engaged in
   policy-making, analysis, or related functions—as excepted service employees
   without the usual civil service protections, Schedule F would enable hiring
   and firing based on political considerations rather than qualifications and
   performance. This shift would undermine the principle that federal employment
   decisions must be based on merit, as enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8).

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   Medical research should be led by scientists, not politicians, for several
   clear and critical reasons: 1. Expertise and Training: Scientists spend years
   gaining specialized knowledge in biology, medicine, and research methodology.
   Their decisions are based on rigorous evidence, peer-reviewed data, and
   established scientific principles. Politicians, while often skilled in
   leadership and public policy, typically lack the technical expertise required
   to guide complex medical research responsibly. 2. Objectivity and Integrity:
   Scientific research is rooted in objectivity—driven by data, not ideology.
   Politicians, by nature of their roles, often operate within the constraints
   of public opinion, political agendas, or election cycles. Allowing political
   interests to override scientific judgment risks biasing research outcomes,

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   The proposed rule would significantly erode the principles of merit-based
   hiring, due process protections, and the non-partisan nature of the federal
   civil service. By introducing an at-will employment structure for
   policy-influencing positions, this measure dismantles the very safeguards
   that ensure government employees serve the public interest rather than
   political agendas. Federal employees are protected under a structured system
   that allows for fair accountability processes, ensuring that removal
   decisions are based on legitimate concerns rather than political bias or
   retaliation. Eliminating these protections would make civil servants
   vulnerable to abrupt termination, chilling their ability to provide honest,

   This is an absolutely terrible idea that will make government less efficient,
   reduce the trust the populace has in the government, and add politics into
   things that ideally should remain as politically neutral as possible. This
   rule would effectively put in place a system where non-partisan career civil
   servants, those with the expertise and drive to perform the vital functions
   of the government and its agencies, would be routinely removed and replaced
   with ideologues without the correct expertise to perform their jobs every
   time the current whims of whatever administration is in power changes. Anyone
   who claims to value the importance of a meritocratic system of hiring,
   whether that is in the public or private sphere, should recognize that such a
   system would not hire the best people for the job, but instead would emplace
   only sycophants who can parrot a party line. That should similarly frighten

   Having at-will political appointees in such positions will further undermine
   the U.S. leading position and reputation across the globe, and hinder
   groundbreaking innovations and developments to improve health and well-being
   of the US population. Credibility is already taking a hit with the
   appointment of RFK Jr as HHS secretary and the initiation of a study to 'find

   Grantmaking is an important form of policymaking, so employees with a

   This regulation would revive the first Trump Administration’s “Schedule F”
   initiative under a new name: “Schedule Policy / Career.” Most career civil
   servants are in what’s known as the competitive or the excepted services and
   earn due process protections after they complete their probationary or trial
   periods of employment. That means that they can be fired for cause—for
   example, poor performance—but not for other, political reasons. But this new
   excepted service schedule, Schedule Policy/Career, lacks such protections and
   once “policy influencing” positions are moved into that schedule, the career
   employees in those positions would be fireable “at will.” This would impact
   tens or even hundreds of thousands of federal workers in “policy-influencing”
   roles and give the Administration the ability to fire them based on political
   allegiance rather than merit. The proposed rule undermines more than 140

   QUOTE: "This proposed rule of OPM must not be allowed to take effect in managing our civil service employees. Our civil service must stay a merit based, nonpartisan professionals and experts who are dedicated and loyal to constitution, democracy and the rule of law."

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   The proposed rule of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is a harmful
   sinister plot to create a civil service workforce based on cronyism and
   composed of sycophants. Removal of civil servants due to poor performance and
   misconduct is an excuse. It is a cunning excuse because no tax payer and a
   professional like me will tolerate a subpar and incompetent civil servant or
   somebody engaged in misconduct unless he/she works for the current
   President's cabinet! Why are these supervisors not coming forward to document
   their difficulties in removing employees for poor performance and misconduct?
   OPM has bunch of tools to do just that. May be these supervisors are
   themselves incompetent and politically affiliated partisan individuals. They
   do not want to be bothered or delayed by "due process" that an individual
   must get. Schedule F violates the Civil Service Reform Act. I strongly
   disagree with Schedule F. Congress must stop Schedule F. Politicizing the
   civil service undermines Americans'

   RE: Public Comment in Response to Improving Performance, Accountability and

   to express my deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific
   federal positions, which would erode necessary protections for those serving
   within the federal statistical system and could transform positions which
   rely on specific expertise to political ones. The proposed rule, “Improving
   Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” would
   call into question the objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for
   our economic indicators, public health assessments, energy utilization and
   many other statistics. Federal statistical agencies are particularly
   vulnerable to the proposed rule: Politicization: Schedule Policy/Career could
   lead to the politicization of the federal statistical workforce. Official
   federal statistics clearly influence public policy of all sorts: monetary,

   Undoubtedly, the US is far and away the world’s leader in medical research.
   The secret to why so many life-saving and economy-boosting therapies and

   scientists and the rigorous, peer-reviewed, and non-politicized manner in
   which scientists receive federal funding to conduct this research. I lead a

   serving on the review panels (“study sections”) that examine these grants,

   I am a former Federal employee, and I am commenting in my personal capacity.
   Federal workers take an oath to protect the Constitution against all enemies,

   Rather, we serve the American people, regardless of their political

   political appointee positions, so an exponential increase of this type of
   position could lead to many open positions and reduced effectiveness of many
   agencies. There is also insufficient justification for this policy change.
   The proposed rule states that it is difficult to fire Federal employees who
   do not perform at a high standard. This is stated without evidence, yet such

   This rule change is NOT needed. It's funny how this is the ONLY
   administration to supposedly need this rule change. Because they say they are
   not be able to fire someone for "poor performance or misconduct". The reason
   is that this administration defines "misconduct" as "not obeying the
   directives of this administration because they are illegal". In other words,
   not that the employee's conduct was improper according to the normal rules of
   employment, but that the rules of conduct are changing under this
   administration. If there were actual misconduct according to normal, or
   actual poor performance, that would be easily documented and the employee can
   be removed. This president has made a career of "you're fired". Why is it so
   incompeted that his administration cannot use the rules that are in place for
   removing bad employees? The answer is simple - their definition of "bad" is
   "not a sycophant, not a loyalist, not willing to just obey orders". Plus,

   Dear Office of Personnel Management: I, Anonymous, submit these comments

   Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” 90 Fed.
   Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025). I write to express opposition to the Proposed
   Rule. 1. As a retired IRS agent, and now a mostly retired Certified Public
   Accountant, I have observed the workings of federal government agencies from

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I am concerned about the proposed ruling and, most importantly, this portion:
   The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing a rule to increase
   career employee accountability. Agency supervisors report great difficulty
   removing employees for poor performance or misconduct. The proposed rule lets
   policy-influencing positions be moved into Schedule Policy/Career. These
   positions will remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis. Yet they
   will be at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals.
   This will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions
   who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process
   by intentionally subverting Presidential directives. First, I would like to
   see documented evidence of "great difficulty removing employees for poor
   performance or misconduct." Second, I understand that some federal scientific
   employees, like those who work for the NSF, will be under this move. NSF and

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I oppose this proposal to drastically increase the number of political
   appointees in the Federal workforce by involuntarily reclassifying career
   civil servants as appointees and thereby removing job protections which act
   as a fundamental constraint against political interference. Replacing career
   civil servants with partisan loyalists that can be fired at will politicizes
   public service and reduces organizational performance. This is particularly
   true for science agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF),
   National Institutes for Health (NIH), and the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); they cannot meet their statutorily
   mandated scientific missions if politics, rather than scientific expertise,
   drive decision-making. Federally supported science has been so successful

   This Executive Order should not be implemented. Given what we've seen

   The politicization of science destroys knowledge, innovation, careers, and

   support my claim about the Trump administration politicizing science, I'm
   referring to the administration's involvement in terminating thousands of

   Management’s (OPM) Proposed Rule “Improving Performance, Accountability and
   Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” 90 Fed. Reg. 17182 (April 23, 2025), on
   behalf of myself as a concerned citizen. I write to express opposition to the
   Proposed Rule. I served for over 33 years in the Federal government in both
   staff level and management positions, including as a GS-15 division director.
   In those years, I never considered myself in a policy making or influencing
   position. We all considered ourselves as information gatherers, scribes, and

   QUOTE: "Eroding these protections, particularly for scientists, would increase their vulnerability to undue political influence, severely damaging the integrity of public science."

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   Science is fundamentally about uncovering objective facts, independent of
   political considerations. Facts do not shift with political tides; they
   remain constant, irrespective of who occupies the White House or holds
   legislative power. Therefore, categorizing scientists—whose role is purely to
   discover and communicate these objective truths—as politically influential or
   aligned is both misleading and harmful. Scientists provide policymakers and
   the public with essential, unbiased information. Their data and analyses
   inform decisions across critical areas such as public health, environmental
   safety, national security, and technological innovation. Viewing this vital
   role as politically charged undermines the integrity of scientific inquiry
   and erodes trust in science itself. Firing or sidelining scientists simply
   because their factual findings conflict with prevailing political narratives
   is not only absurd but dangerous. Doing so denies policymakers and the public
   access to accurate,

   (OPM-2025-0004) I strongly oppose OPM’s Proposed Rule: OPM Proposed Rule
   “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil
   Service”. The Rule would be little more than a return to the patronage or
   “spoils” system, which existed before the enactment of Pendleton Act of 1883,
   by allowing the replacement of hundreds of thousands of nonpartisan, career
   civil servants with political appointees loyal to the current president. I
   joined the White House Office of Management and Budget in 1980, at the end of
   the Carter Administration. Like other OMB career staff, I was not primarily a
   Democrat or a Republican, but instead I strongly endorsed and practiced the

   Comment addressing Docket No. OPM-2025-0004 :
   https://www.regulations.gov/document/OPM-2025-0004-0001 The rule proposed by
   the Office of Personnel Management, identified by Docket No. OPM-2025-0004,
   aims to create an additional category for federal employees referred to as
   “Schedule Policy/Career” (“Regulations.gov,” 2025). This proposal would
   remove federal employees from their positions without mandating procedures
   and authorize the fast removal of those employees. I oppose the Office of
   Personnel Management's proposal for the removal of employees who engage in
   misconduct, and I believe it would undermine our current political system by
   silencing voices that oppose the presidential candidates. As a person who
   believes in nonpartisan civil service, those civil servants must provide an
   impartial role in maintaining partisan merit and serve to uphold the
   Constitution. I am concerned that this order would politic

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   The Trump administration’s new regulation would institute Schedule F, a plan
   to reclassify tens of thousands of government jobs as “policymaking
   positions” and therefore subject to presidential appointment and removal of
   those in these positions. This regulation would reclassify jobs that once
   fell under civil service protection and where the jobs could be filled on the
   basis of expertise and experience to policymaker positions. Those in these
   poisitions could be fired at will if they do not align with current
   Administration policy. These new policymaker positions would include those
   with substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency
   grantmaking, drafting of funding opportunity announcements, evaluation of
   grant applications, and recommending or selecting grant recipients. In regard
   to NIH it appears that all Institute and Center Directors would become
   political appointees. This will remove scientific decision making on public

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   It is crucial for U.S. federal employees, particularly those in career civil

   Non-partisanship and Neutrality: A core principle of the civil service is to
   provide consistent, unbiased service to the American public, regardless of
   which political party is in power. If career employees were political
   appointees, their jobs could be tied to the shifting political winds of each
   administration. This would undermine public trust and lead to a perception
   that government services are being administered for political gain rather
   than for the common good. The Hatch Act, for instance, specifically aims to
   maintain a federal workforce free from partisan political influence or

   I have concerns regarding changes proposed to the employment status of

   I oppose the adoption of the proposed Office of Personnel Management rule
   change, RIN 3206-A080; Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004. The proposed rule change is
   so wrong for, at least, the following reasons. This change would politicize
   the United States civil service by making up to 50,000 civil service
   employees “at-will” employees across multiple agencies such as Agriculture,
   Defense and Treasury, dependent upon the desires or whims of the current
   administration, no matter who is in power. At-will employment will require
   civil service employees to follow Presidential directives or lose their
   respective jobs. Also, the anticipated employee turnover will deter qualified
   persons from applying for at-will civil service employment, thereby reducing
   the pool of qualified applicants. Finally, at-will employment will discourage
   those already employed from speaking the truth and cause the loss of
   institutional knowledge. Examples of such conduct have been evident in the
   current administration.

   Reinstating Schedule F, as proposed in this rule would undermine the ability
   for our government to function according to laws and regulations. Under the
   current system, civil service jobs are protected to ensure that those holding
   them are free from outside interference and political pressure. This is how
   it should be. A bureaucracy cannot function effectively if it changes with
   the political winds every 4-8 years, or with the whims of the president.
   Further, a functioning democracy requires stability in the various agencies
   of government and this policy would create instability and chaos.That's
   because while politics may change, facts do not. The civil servants who have
   worked their way up through the ranks of government have experience and

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I oppose this change to how the civil service runs. As an academic in STEM
   with many peers working in career civil servant positions, the primary reason
   my colleagues are willing to take those jobs is the job security. Civil
   servant positions often have significantly worse pay than comparable
   positions in industry, but have similar job protections to tenure in
   academia. Researchers and other technical people who want to help others and
   make the country better are often willing to take those jobs despite the
   lower salary because the job protections help them plan financially for their
   futures. This enables government agencies to hire people with important
   expertise and skillsets. While the rule states that reclassified employees
   will only be fired for poor performance or partisanship, it's unclear what
   protections will be in place to ensure this is how it will be used. The

   The United States has a historic tradition of civic service that began in the
   early 1900s, after significant anti-corruption reform. Prior to these
   reforms, the civic service was used as a spoils system to reward political
   loyalty, rather than competence or to ensure care for the public. It created
   a system where loyalty was owed to whoever got you your job and whoever could
   fire you, rather than to the public interest of the United States. The civil
   service reforms changed all of that, creating a non-partisan workforce that
   remained from administration to administration. These civil service employees
   are rewarded with strong government benefits and job security, all in the
   name of helping them maintain their neutrality. It is unsurprising, yet no
   less striking, that the most corrupt administration in memory (this one!) is

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   True, sound science is not partisan and should not be controlled by
   particular federal administrations and political parties. For decades,
   federal scientists of varying personal political, religious, social and
   philosophical leanings have worked together as dedicated civil servants to
   improve the quality of life for individuals in the USA, often with impacts
   around the world. Science is not a 4 or 8 year process and it would be
   chaotic for broad swaths of staff doing basic and translational science to be
   unable to continue their work, unhindered, every time a new administration
   arrives. Continuity of skilled staffing and long-term planning by leadership
   is critical to establishing and carrying out goals such as the major
   accomplishment of the Human Genome Project and other achievements that might
   get less attention, such as determining that mind-body practices can protect
   the brain from detrimental effects of chronic pain (PMID: 23719569) and NIDCD

   I am writing to oppose the implementation of the proposed Office Of Personnel
   Management regulation, Docket OPM-2025-0004 (RIN 3206-A080). I am
   specifically appalled at the wording: "This will allow agencies to quickly
   remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform
   poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting
   Presidential directives." This puts experts with specialized backgrounds,
   education, training and experience at full risk from and at the whim of
   political retaliation. Of course, a poorly performing employee should be
   subject to review. However, as has already been experienced since January 20,
   2025, too many employees are being kicked out of their jobs for no other
   reason than politics, i.e., simply because they weren't bowing to political
   pressure. When an employee with experience in defense, health, meteorology,

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I write in strong opposition to this rule for the four reasons detailed
   below. 1. Statutory overreach: The rule rests on 5 U.S.C. §§ 3301–3302, yet
   those provisions must be read with the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The
   CSRA permits removals of career employees only “for such cause as will
   promote the efficiency of the service,” § 7513(a), and limits new excepted
   schedules to roles that are inherently “confidential” or
   “policy-determining.” Reclassifying broad swaths of analysts, engineers, and
   scientists exceeds any historical exercise of § 3302 and guts protections
   Congress has never repealed. 2. Due process: Once an employee earns
   competitive status, the Fifth Amendment recognizes a property interest in
   continued employment. Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532
   (1985). A regulation cannot extinguish that interest wholesale. Only Congress
   can do so. Transforming existing positions into an at-will “Schedule

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   Though the proposed justification for the changes in the regulations
   surrounding federal employees seems reasonable (increase efficiency of
   management and decrease the chance of employee malfeasance or undue

   worker/employee job security as well as a significant increase in likely
   policy volatility from presidential administration to administration. In
   theory, the new paradigm of at will employment could be beneficial if managed
   reasonably and carefully by a trusted leadership group. However, Mr Trump has
   given the country ample opportunity to view an alternative potential reality.
   He has slashed funding and work forces at multiple federal agencies without
   apparent serious consideration for the implications on workers or public

   This comment is submitted in strong opposition to any proposed
   reclassification of federal employees under a new "Schedule Policy/Career" or
   similar mechanism that would strip career civil servants of their
   long-standing merit system protections. Such a change represents a
   fundamental assault on the principles of good governance, effective public
   service, and the very foundation of a non-partisan federal workforce. The
   implications of implementing Schedule Policy/Career are far-reaching and
   profoundly detrimental, threatening to undermine the efficiency, integrity,
   and public trust in the United States government. Specifically, I oppose
   these proposed changes as they will erode merit-based principles, pressure
   federal employees to be loyal to current and future administrations instead
   of upholding their oath to the U.S. Constitution. They will also undermine
   expertise and institutional knowledge and weaken accountability. ---

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   This regulation is deficient in several areas. For one, it fails to properly
   describe the legal distinction between the Supreme Court decision that
   shields the President from conviction or lawsuits based on actions that may
   not be legal and those of employees who are ordered to commit actions against
   statutory requirements under the threat of coercion as they are designated
   "at will". The regulation at a minimum should define that an at will federal
   employee may not be compelled or face any disciplinary action for failing to
   follow an order that is in violation of statutory provisions. The regulation
   should define an appeal process for an at will employee against who action is
   taking for failing to perform an illegal order. Failure to address even these
   basic requirements should result in the rule being reproposed with these
   components to allow the public to sufficient review and comment on how the
   government intends to address these requirements, or risk a violation of the

   To whom it may concern I am in complete opposition to this proposed
   regulation for “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in
   the Civil Service “ (Regulation) submitted by the Office of Management and
   Budget under the Trump Administration. The federal civil service system ,
   which is based on merit, was established by The Pendleton Act ( Act) of 1863.
   This Act was in response to the ineffectiveness and inefficiencies of the
   “Spoils System “ in which federal employment was based upon political
   loyalties or personal relationships. Career Civil Servants were further
   protected by enactment of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, which stated that removal
   actions must be for merit-based reasons and not inappropriate causes, such as
   whistleblowing. Furthermore, under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the
   concerns that the merit-based civil service rules impeded agencies’ abilities
   to effectively manage employees and remove poor performance were addressed.

   Politicizing NIH will degrade the scientific integrity of research done in

   has this investment resulted in breakthrough scientific discoveries that have

   Nevertheless, the funding of the NIH is not the only critical element

   Throughout my nearly five years of service, I have worked under both

   an openly stated ambition long before his second term. The White House frames

   Donald Moynihan noted in Brookings that Trump unveiled an executive order
   weeks before the 2020 election invoking the so-called “Schedule F” to create
   a new class of political appointee. The public understands that the clear
   purpose of the schedule F proposed here is partisan politicization. This
   means that public employees Will be hired and fired on the basis of their
   political loyalty to the president. This is a disservice to the American

   Overall, the proposed rule is a bad idea. It may improve organizational
   performance by making it easier to to get rid or poor performers, but it is
   just as likely that it will get rid of outstanding performers who have
   unconventional ideas: remember the Apple “think different” ad campaign. The
   most likely outcome reclassifying a large number positions as “at will” is a
   culture of caution and conformity—people at every level just doing what the

   It makes a subtle switch from talking about policy-determining and

   Allowing these positions to be converted to political appointees risks
   replacing seasoned, apolitical experts with individuals lacking technical

   Specifically, the reduced internship hour requirements, broadened

   work closely with many employees of several federal agencies. All of these
   career employees were dedicated professionals who were recruited as
   non-partisan experts in their fields. These employees were committed to
   serving the best interests of our country in non-partisan ways. Under current
   practices, Federal agencies recruit employees based on merit-based
   principles; that recruitment process must be maintained to ensure the

   I am publicly commenting on OPM Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004; RIN 3206-AO80
   "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil
   Service". I oppose the move to reclassify federal workers making them more
   susceptible to the whims of political forces. Our federal workforce needs to
   remain a-political and unbiased. They need to be assured of their positions
   regardless of the administration in power at any given time. They hold
   institutional knowledge and expertise that is essential for the functioning
   of the government and the maintenance of trust in our government. Our civil
   service workforce should remain that--civil. This is not possible if their
   protections erode, and their jobs depend on administrative tests of loyalty.
   These are my primary concerns: 1. This proposed rule undermines Merit System

   The only crisis of incompetence anywhere in the federal workforce is the one

   I strongly object to the introduction or revival of the "Schedule F"
   classification for federal workers. This proposal poses a serious threat to
   the foundation of the federal civil service, which is built on the principle
   of merit-based hiring and promotion. The merit system ensures that government
   positions are awarded based on qualifications, experience, and
   performance—not political loyalty or affiliation. This system has safeguarded
   the professionalism, impartiality, and competence of the federal workforce
   for over a century. While President Trump has previously framed Schedule F as
   a merit-based initiative through Executive Order 14173, the reality is that
   it would erode, not enhance, the merit system. By permitting the dismissal of
   career civil servants without cause, Schedule F directly undermines the
   Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883. That law was enacted to dismantle
   the spoils system, where political favoritism dictated employment decisions,

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Office of Personnel
   Management’s proposed rule (Docket ID: OPM-2025-0004), which seeks to
   establish a new “Schedule Policy/Career” (Schedule P/C) classification for
   federal employees in policy-influencing roles. This proposal would
   effectively strip approximately 50,000 career civil servants of long-standing
   merit-based protections by reclassifying them as at-will employees. While
   these positions would technically remain part of the competitive service, the
   rule would eliminate essential due process safeguards, allowing agencies to
   terminate employees without the standard adverse action procedures or appeals
   processes. Such a change undermines the foundational principles of a
   nonpartisan civil service. By removing protections from employees in
   policy-making and policy-advocating roles, the rule opens the door to
   politicization, enabling administrations to replace experienced professionals
   with individuals chosen for their political

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   The rule's discussion of Free Enterprise Fund repeatedly explains that MSPB
   administrative judges (AJs) cannot constitutionally enjoy removal protections
   because the politically appointed Board members have such protections,
   impermissibly creating dual for cause removal protections. But the President
   has in fact removed at least one such Board member and has argued in court
   that the Board members' removal protections are unconstitutional. If this is
   so, then there is no Free Enterprise problem with the AJs' removal
   protections. The rule addresses this in cursory and unconvincing fashion,
   ignoring that the government is trying to argue both ways. If the government
   truly believes the Board members' removal protections are unconstitutional,
   and prevails on that view, that obviates the constitutional need under Free
   Enterprise Fund to vitiate the AJs' protections. Additionally, while citing
   Arthrex, the rule does not convincingly explain why another method of control

   I submit these comments in strong opposition to the proposed rule. The
   justification offered for this rule is built on a series of misleading

   carrying out lawful directives based on personal preference, ignoring the
   fundamental legal and ethical obligations that guide civil service behavior.
   Refusing to execute an order that is unlawful, unconstitutional, or
   inconsistent with statutory authority is not insubordination — it is
   adherence to the oath of office and longstanding legal requirements. The rule
   also implies that exercising First Amendment rights during personal time is
   grounds for professional censure, a position that is constitutionally
   indefensible. Federal employees, like all citizens, retain their rights to
   free speech and lawful political participation outside of work hours. The

   This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has
   underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.
   First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the

   merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath
   of career civil servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or

   Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is
   unetical to the principle in accordance with 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8), which
   mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   Proposed Schedule P/C misrepresents career civil servants, implying
   legal/operational concerns justify removal – a false portrayal of their duty
   to ethically implement law. Dissent isn't misconduct, but professionalism.
   Removing such voices erodes integrity. The rule ignores existing
   accountability (probation, PIPs, adverse actions). The issue is inconsistent
   use, not lack of tools. Reclassifying won't fix poor supervision, but worsen
   morale. Invest in manager training instead. "Policy-influencing" is too
   broad, risking politicization of apolitical experts (attorneys, analysts).
   Removing their rights creates a loyalty test over merit. Career employees are
   institutional memory, not saboteurs. This rule makes expertise expendable.
   The rule undermines merit principles and due process. Accountability needs
   documentation, not unchecked discretion. Stripping protections risks

   In response to Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in
   the Civil Service, I want to say that involuntarily transferring workers into
   Policy/Career positions and depriving them of adverse action procedures and
   appeals to the MSPB will hurt our solid science and fact-based programs more
   than help. The president is over-reaching into the minutiae of everyday
   government agency work. Our best and brightest scientists, engineers and
   technicians can not do their best work with worrying if an action or analysis
   will be interpreted as somehow against the President’s policies. What would
   his policies have to do with the everyday work of food and drug inspection,
   for example, or keeping cow manure out of a stream? Our country needs to keep

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I do not support this proposed rule. It is quite clear that this proposed
   rule would increase partisanship and decrease the effectiveness of the civil
   service. As noted in the proposed rule, there are already clear procedures to
   remove ineffective or poor performing employees and clear procedures for
   these employees to appeal adverse actions. The claim that it is very
   difficult to remove poor performers or that many believe it is not possible
   to remove poor performers is not proof that this system is ineffective. The
   claim that it is difficult to remove poor performers and an "at will"
   classification is needed is misleading. It is already possible to remove poor
   performers. This proposed rule would simply make it easier to remove
   employees without due process, creating a chilling effect where career

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   This rule should not be adopted. I want a functioning federal government with
   employees who are productive in their work, professional in their conduct,
   and accountable to the taxpayer for their performance. While poor performance
   and misconduct are never acceptable, there are already robust mechanisms in
   place to a) identify those problematic employees, b) provide them due process
   to defend their case if there was a mistake, and c) terminate them if the
   allegations are valid. Many federal agencies regularly publish internal
   reports explaining how many employees have been flagged for misconduct or
   poor performance and removed from service. There are always terminations on
   these reports. The system works. In short, the new proposal is not necessary.
   Furthermore, this removes the civil service protections from partisanship

   I am commenting in regards to Docket No. OPM–2025–0004, Proposed rule
   “Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil
   Service”. As an American, the protection of our civil service is of critical
   importance in preserving trust in government data. As such, I oppose this
   proposed rule. While the rule claims to preserve the non-partisan nature of
   these positions, this is difficult to square with removing the protections
   that keep these positions free from partisan influence, one of which is
   rigorous protection from arbitrary and political retaliation. The rule change
   attempts to hide the significance of this change behind the term
   "policy-influencing positions". Many non-partisan federal employees including
   those from agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics could be
   considered to have "policy-influencing positions". But these are not policy

   **Introduction** The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 was a landmark piece of
   legislation designed to ensure that federal employees are hired, promoted,
   and retained based on merit rather than political affiliation. The proposed
   creation of Schedule Policy/Career is a bureaucratic maneuver that undermines

   opens the door to unwarranted political influence over career civil servants.
   **Background** The merit-based civil service system has been a cornerstone of
   effective government operation since the Pendleton Act of 1883, which sought
   to eliminate political patronage and establish professional standards. The

   reclassify thousands of career civil service positions as “confidential,
   policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating.” These roles would

   TRUNCATED TEXT (999 characters):
   I am opposed to the proposed regulation that is enacting EO 14171 through the
   creation of the Schedule Policy/Career classification. It is at odds with the
   plain text of Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 as well as the intent. By
   moving some employees from the General Schedule to the Schedule Policy/Career
   and making them at-will employees means that they can be fired for any
   reason, no matter how minor. This also makes them vulnerable to the whims of
   an administration which will undermine the non-partisan aspect of the career
   civil service. 5 USC § 2302 (b)(3) plainly states that employees shall not
   coerce political activities or take action against other employees as
   reprisal for the political beliefs. At-will employment is at odds with the
   section of the CSRA. In addition, 5 USC § 2301 (b)(8)(A) further reinforces
   this point as employees are explicitly protected against arbitrary actions,

   I strongly oppose the proposed rule to implement Schedule Policy/Career
   (formerly Schedule F), which would move thousands of career federal employees

   applying 5 U.S.C. § 7511(b)(2) to exclude incumbent employees from chapter 75
   procedural protections when they are reclassified or involuntarily
   transferred. This provision clearly ties exceptions to the position, not to
   incumbent employees’ accrued rights. The rule’s retroactive denial of fair
   process contradicts established precedent (Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134

   you through the brave new world this policy seems to want. You wake up. Your

   the old fire chief was let go. Why? Not because he was bad at his job. Not
   because he set a fire. No, it’s because he suggested sprinklers were a good
   idea and someone in City Hall said that sounded like sabotage. The new chief
   is a motivational speaker named Randy who once played a firefighter in a
   middle school play. But he is very excited and extremely on-message. At
   school drop-off, your kid’s science teacher has also been replaced. The

   I strongly oppose the proposed rule. Its scope will have a substantial
   negative impact on many facets of American life, and will make America worse
   rather than great. The specific aspect I would like to highlight is the
   potential for intrusion into the scientific grants process. I have been a
   professor in chemical engineering for over 15 years, and my work has been
   supported by federal grants from multiple agencies including NSF, NIH, and
   DARPA. I have also served on grant review panels in various for capacities
   for multiple federal agencies. I thus have experience and knowledge related
   to the scientific grants process. The OPM final guidance to agencies for
   including positions in Schedule Policy/Career indicates that the following

   TRUNCATED TEXT (999 characters):
   The proposed changes in the rules and processes seem more inclined to allow
   political appointees to more easily remove persons who are not aligned with
   their specific political ideology, despite the justifications for the changes
   being rooted in the belief that it is the workers who are unacceptably
   politically aligned. The changes, therefore, defeat their own justifications
   by allowing political ideology to rule who is part of the Federal civil
   service (as the threat of being easily replaced if one does not fall in line
   with a political appointee's demands is very real) rather than by merit and a
   non-partisan agenda of ensuring the agencies and roles function appropriately
   regardless of political appointees and their ideologies. The changes must not
   be adopted, then, until they can provide a method of ensuring that the
   unacceptable political ideologies the changes intend to fight are not allowed
   to creep in to the process through other means. Processes such as the appeals

   I am submitting this comment in opposition to the proposed rule, “Improving
   Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.” As a
   former U.S. Army Field Artillery Officer and a Presidential Management

   Service to nation guided my actions during military service and again as a
   federal civilian employee working across two agencies with exposure to many

   with the understanding that my loyalty was to the Constitution and the law,
   not to any one president. I served knowing there were legal and procedural
   protections to allow me to act faithfully as I served the American people.
   This rule threatens to upend that tradition. By reviving a version of

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I strongly oppose creation of a new Schedule “Policy/Career” for federal
   workers. This proposed regulation would decimate the merit-based civil

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I oppose this change for civil service employee protections. There are
   already set rules for how to handle employees who are performing under what
   is required. If it is deemed that process is ineffective, then the evaluation
   process should change. This proposal will make it easier for the sitting
   president to remove civilian service employees that have more awareness of
   previous changes enacted and how that affected the government office they
   worked in. The continuity of a civil servant is an invaluable piece of
   information that can benefit the government they have chosen to work for.
   People choose to be civil servants for the honor of serving their country.
   Majority of government positions are paid exponentially less than private
   sector counterparts. Removing any protections from firing at will would only
   prevent having qualified people applying for open positions. The President of

   Comment in Response to Docket No. OPM-2025-0004 I am writing to express my
   deep concern regarding the effort to reclassify specific federal positions.
   Reclassification would erode necessary protections for those serving within
   the federal government and could transform positions which rely on specific
   expertise into political positions, thus eroding both the quality of work and
   public trust in the federal government. My particular expertise is in federal
   statistics. The proposed rule, “Improving Performance, Accountability and
   Responsiveness in the Civil Service,” would call into question the
   objectivity that both sides of the aisle rely on for key data on the economy,

   I am commenting on the proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management
   Docket ID OPM-2025-0004 RIN 3206-AO80 I am strongly opposed to this proposed
   rule change. First, the creation of a Schedule Policy/Career directly

   to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for
   federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil
   servants—particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be
   reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the
   door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the
   principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8),
   which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free
   from political influence. Moreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   To whom it may concern, I recently learned about Executive Order 14171, and
   upon reading it, I believe it is likely to damage scientific progress in the
   US. Over my 14 years as a scientific researcher, I’ve learned that
   advancement of scientific knowledge relies on scientists’ ability to build
   upon existing work—both their own and their colleagues’. One way this can be
   seen is in the emphasis, which exists broadly across disciplines, on
   communicating your findings through publication, oral presentation, and other
   formats. On page 17187, section 2 states that people in career positions “are
   required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their
   ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of
   executive authority solely in the President. Failure to do so is grounds for

   I. Introduction This comment is submitted in strong opposition to any
   rulemaking or executive policy that would implement or reinstate "Schedule F"

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   The proposed rule suffers from fundamental inconsistencies and lacks
   evidentiary support. While OPM claims the rule will enhance accountability by
   easing the removal of career employees, citing supervisors’ alleged
   difficulties addressing underperformance, its practical effect would be to
   strip due process protections primarily from policy-oriented employees, not
   the lower-level employees purportedly "hard to fire." Notably, many
   reclassified positions under this rule are supervisory (e.g., GS-14/15 policy
   advisors), contradicting its stated goal of targeting non-performing staff.
   This misalignment raises questions about the rule’s true objectives. 1.
   Arbitrary Distinction Between Policy and Non-Policy Roles The rule’s
   bifurcation of employees into "policy" and "non-policy" categories is legally
   and logically untenable: 2. No Empirical Basis: OPM provides no evidence that

   The stated purpose of the new rule is to "to increase career employee

   I am writing to ask that OPM-2025-0004 be dropped for several reasons. I feel
   it will drastically diminish the expertise and performance of our federal

   average 2 months, recently it has started to take, on average, over 150 days.
   That’s over 5 months! That is too long for so many positions to remain
   unfilled. Government organizations will not work well with so many positions
   left unfilled or filled with temporary appointments. I’ve seen firsthand how
   people in these temporary appointments are scared to make decisions that may
   be at odds with those who may follow them. Second, at-will employment can

   codifies merit principles and guarantees career civil servants procedural
   protections against arbitrary removal. Reclassifying policy-adjacent roles
   into an at-will category undermines these statutory rights. Title 5
   guarantees notice, response, and appeal rights before adverse actions. This
   rule circumvents those requirements and exceeds OPM’s authority by
   effectively rewriting statute through regulation—an ultra vires action. II.

   I am strongly opposed to this proposed rule change. Federal workers are
   protected by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Title VII of the Civil
   Rights Act, and many other federal laws and rules. These laws and rules exist
   for a reason – to ensure that the U.S. government is able to attract and
   retain experienced federal workers. These laws and rules also already allow
   for removal of civil service workers that are underperforming or have been
   found in misconduct. The due process protections are essential to ensure that
   workers are given fair opportunities and employees are not fired for unjust
   or unlawful reasons. Further, the civil service is an extremely competitive,
   merit-based system. Job offers are very difficult to get, and all job
   postings have highly detailed and complex KSAs and requirements. Applications
   are deeply vetted, going through numerous layers of review to ensure that

   The proposed implementation of Schedule F represents a fundamental threat to

   and competence, rather than their political affiliations. It fosters a
   professional, nonpartisan workforce dedicated to serving the public interest,

   First and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the

   spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal
   employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants—particularly
   those involved in policy-making or analysis—to be reclassified and
   potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to
   politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the

   Congress—not the President—established the Merit System Principles, adverse

   does not permit executive override of these frameworks by fiat. Furthermore,

   adverse action protections from career employees is legally flawed and
   dangerously expansive. The agency’s argument—that even if these terms are
   terms of art, they merely convert positions into political designations
   without consequence—fails to engage with the purpose and structure of Title
   5. Congress specifically designed the civil service to differentiate between
   political and career appointments. This distinction is fundamental to
   ensuring a nonpartisan professional workforce. By suggesting that a
   presidential declaration alone can redefine the status and protections of
   career employees, OPM contradicts longstanding civil service norms and
   statutes. Treating policy-influencing responsibilities as sufficient to
   nullify chapter 75 protections effectively eliminates any meaningful
   difference between Schedule C and Schedule Policy/Career. The a

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   This proposed regulation introduces a subtle but significant change by
   replacing the term "civil service" with "civil employees." While this might
   appear to be a minor semantic update, it signals a troubling shift in how the
   federal workforce is viewed. Words matter. The term "civil service" reflects
   the duty, responsibility, and tradition of public servants who are committed
   to serving the American people and upholding the Constitution. Recasting
   these individuals as mere "employees" risks reducing their roles to that of
   private-sector workers whose primary obligation is to a manager or executive
   - not to the public or the law. The United States government is not a
   business. Its purpose is not to generate profit or efficiency at the cost of
   independence or institutional stability. It exists to serve the people,
   protect their rights, and promote general welfare. Federal civil servants are
   not loyal to any one individual or administration. They take and oath to the

   These proposals will do more harm than good. The biggest obstacle to
   accountability is that supervisors fail to timely document performance and/or

   action to address performance and/or disciplinary issues or stack charges on
   issues that span multiple performance cycles. Other factors include
   supervisor micromanagement of employees to a point where trust is broken
   beyond repair. I’ve seen examples of this in a role of supervisor and as a
   union representative. Many times problem employees move from work unit to
   work unit without any accountability because supervisors failed to do their
   jobs. I’ve represented employees where supervisors were heavy handed and the

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   Essentially, placing civil servants in a schedule F type position essentially
   politicizes what is currently a nonpartisan position. Meaning, currently
   civil servants perform their duties based on the needs of the American people
   and led by their specific expertise (e.g., scientists making decisions based
   on science). Turning their positions into schedule F or the like essentially
   places them to carry out their duties based on the whoever is currently
   president, which makes these positions subject to the politics of any future
   president, whether you like them or not. So, if an American citizen doesn’t
   align with a sitting presidents ideology, they will be significantly impacted
   by the decisions being made by civil servants working in government because
   their decisions must align with the president’s. The downstream effects of

   The “Schedule F” classification for federal employees must be rejected. This
   proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system, which is the bedrock

   effectively undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which

   approach to hiring federal employees. By authorizing reclassification and
   potential termination for a wide swathe of career civil servants who are
   involved in policy-making or analysis, Schedule F clears the way for
   political hiring and firing. This goes against the principle of a politically
   neutral civil service, which is guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. § 2301(b)(8). This
   statute requires that all federal employment choices be based on merit and
   should not be affected by political considerations. Furthermore, the vague

   Introduction The proposed rule by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
   titled "Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the
   Civil Service," published in the Federal Register on April 23, 2025, attempts
   to reintroduce the principles of the rescinded "Schedule F" classification by
   creating a new subcategory of federal positions stripped of longstanding
   merit-based employment protections. The proposed rule is a controversial
   pivot in the modern regulatory structure of federal employment. The stated
   aim of this rule is to allow greater presidential control over policy-making
   personnel. However, the proposal is deeply flawed from both a legal and
   policy perspective. This comment critically examines the legality inherent in
   the proposed rule and illustrates its potential to undermine governmental
   efficiency, particularly in domains critical to national security. The

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I am against the proposed rule to establish a new "Schedule Policy/Career"
   category. Civil service protections were introduced in the late 19th century
   to combat the "spoils" system, where government officials appointed their
   supporters to political offices. This system led to corruption and
   inefficiency. Over the years, several civil service reform acts have been
   enacted to ensure that government positions are filled by non-partisan,
   competent, and qualified civil servants. America requires a federal workforce
   that is professional, nonpartisan, and capable of providing honest,
   evidence-based advice to policymakers without fear of political retaliation.
   Converting many career roles into at-will positions risks politicizing
   government operations and undermines the reliability of essential public
   programs. Moreover, the rule repeatedly claims that it is not a mechanism for
   firing federal employees based on their political affiliation. If that were

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   The proposed rule unlawfully undermines veterans' competitive hiring
   advantages in federal employment, directly contravening 38 U.S.C. § 4214 and
   Supreme Court precedent (Department of Transportation v. Paralyzed Veterans
   of America, 1986). By diluting competitive service protections, the rule
   illegally obstructs congressionally mandated preferences for veterans—a
   violation that demands immediate rescission. Legal Violations 1. Violation of
   Veterans' Preference Laws (38 U.S.C. § 4214) - Congress explicitly granted
   veterans hiring and retention preferences to recognize their service and
   sacrifice. - The rule weakens competitive service safeguards, effectively
   diminishing veterans' statutory advantages in federal hiring, promotions, and
   retention. - Department of Transportation v. Paralyzed Veterans (1986)
   reinforced that veterans’ hiring rights cannot be circumvented by
   administrative maneuvers. 2. Contravenes Merit System Principles (5 U.S.C. §

   TRUNCATED TEXT (999 characters):
   I am a retired Milwaukee nature center director with a MS degree and the
   author of several books in my field published by the University of Wisconsin
   Press. One of main concerns with this proposed rule is that it compromises
   federal law. Federal law states that civil servants must be hired and
   promoted based on expertise not political loyalty. The proposed rule would
   undermine this and make it likely that civil servants who are expert in their
   fields vulnerable to retribution if their expert evaluations and work are not
   in alignment with the views of President. For example, my family and I are
   gravely concerned that the air we breathe and water we drink will not be
   protected if expert civil servants are eliminated for speaking out on
   polluters and environmental problems.. Another fear is that our health will
   be affected by the elimination of civil servant experts in the CDC and other

   The Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) proposed rule fails to meet the
   most basic requirements of reasoned rulemaking under the Administrative

   reclassified—or even provide criteria for such reclassifications—OPM has
   rendered this rule arbitrary and capricious under Motor Vehicle Manufacturers

   There are existing frameworks of accountability which can be adjusted without
   going to the scope proposed by the new rule. Given that the pattern of
   removing government employees since the creation of DOGE has resulted in a
   large number of errors, public fights, and funding delays, the proposed rule
   does not inspire confidence that a careful mode of establishing
   accountability will be adopted. Consider the decisions regarding the NIH and
   the NSF. The individuals responsible for grant reviews were not
   "unaccountable" in any meaningful way, and they represented experts in their
   fields who applied rigorous review to every application. These actions are
   not in dispute when one consults the track record of the agencies and the
   incredible levels of transparency and accountability afforded to the public
   through the basic structure of the funding scheme. However, the
   implementation of new "accountability" and cost cutting measures at both

   Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil

   To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to express my strong opposition to the
   proposed rule that would reclassify tens of thousands of career federal
   employees as political appointees. This policy would undermine the core
   merit-based principles of the civil service, increase administrative burdens
   on agencies, and significantly harm the effectiveness, transparency, and
   equity of federal programs. The proposed rule undermines good governance.
   Research consistently shows that politicizing the civil service lowers
   organizational performance, reduces employee investment, and creates
   instability. As Hertel-Fernandez, Mertens, and Carpenter (2023) found in
   their study published in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management,
   politicization of the public sector erodes capacity, especially among
   frontline staff tasked with complex implementation. It creates a chilling
   effect that deters civil servants from surfacing politically inconvenient
   information—undermining oversight and accountabilit

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I am writing in regards to the Office of Personnel Management, Docket ID:
   OPM-2025-0004, RIN 3206-AO80. The proposed rules change regarding procedures
   for taking action against civil servants will undermine federal services and
   democracy. These changes are being proposed to make it easier to fire
   employees without cause and due process. Reclassifying a broad category of
   federal employees is a smokescreen for being able to fire employees for
   political reasons, not for "accountability" or "responsiveness." This is a
   baldly political gambit to gain more power for the current administration.
   For evidence of this, just look at Project 2025. Competent and responsible
   government work is vital for the health of our country and its citizens.
   Firing 50,000 federal employees will tragically wound the trust that
   Americans have in their federal government. The vast majority of these
   employees are hard working and honest, and are doing their best every day,

   I am a proud United States veteran writing to express my deep concern about
   the potential reinstatement of Schedule F in the federal workforce. As

   prevail in court cases when removals are challenged by simply documenting its

   that they work for are also underperforming. Therefore, the OPM goes on to

   underperformers quickly so that they can be replaced by other, better
   workers. This might be a reasonable suggestion if the reality of previous
   mass firings under the current presidential administration bore this theory

   Office of Personnel Management Proposed rule RIN 3206-AO80 (Docket ID
   OPM-2025-0004) should not be adopted. The proposed rule would create a
   chilling effect on federal employees. The rule summary states that the
   intended purpose of this rule includes to "remove employees from critical
   positions who [...] intentionally subvert Presidential directives". Or, in
   other words, whose fulfillment of their job duties in furtherance of their
   agency's statutory mandate conflicts with the policy preferences of whoever
   is currently President. The proposed rule affects federal employees
   classified as nonpartisan "career" employees. However, if employees can be
   removed for upholding the law when the law is inconvenient for the
   President's political preferences, then this proposed rule would completely
   abolish the idea of either nonpartisan positions or career federal employees.

   First of all, the federal work force is not bloated. It is about the same
   size it was when Truman was president, although the U.S. population has

   monitoring the ethics of our politicians and employees, testing our water,
   helping with disaster assistance, maintaining our national parks, educating

   I would like to submit a comment in opposition to the proposed rule. One of
   the things that makes our country strong is that the backbone of civil
   servants who perform duties necessary to the public welfare are not easily
   removable when the government changes hands. We once had a system where
   government employees turned over every time a new administration was voted
   into office. It was called patronage, and it delivered a uniformly low level
   of government service as well as massive opportunities for political and
   financial corruption. There is a reason that the patronage system began to be
   reformed all the way back under President Arthur, when he signed the
   Pendleton Act of 1883. I don't see why we should backslide to a 19th century
   understanding of government employment. We need an institutionally
   knowledgable, nonpartisan, professional government workforce more beholden to

   consistently skeptical and mistrustful of career staff when they first
   started in their new positions. But they soon learned that career staff,
   rather than being obstacles to their new initiatives and priorities, were
   highly skilled and professional with a wealth of knowledge and expertise that

   I find the proposal to reinstate a schedule F for the civil service to be

   long-term expertise and experience to effectively do their job. Especially in
   these times of hyper-partisanship, the idea that huge swathes of the civil
   service will turn over with changes in the presidential administration will
   result in a merry go round of workers entering and exiting the service, never
   building the required expertise and constantly changing direction to the

   about what it would mean if people dedicated to their particular field of

   This is an inherently bad rule and should not be implemented. First, it’s
   violates the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) enacted by Congress in 1978. The
   CSRA provides that an agency may only fire, demote, or issue a lengthy
   suspension to an employee “for cause,” not for arbitrary or improper reasons.
   And it must first provide notice of its reasons and an opportunity for the
   employee to respond. The employee may then appeal the action to a neutral
   federal adjudicator, the Merit Systems Protection Board. If the Board rules
   against her, she may go to federal court. The CSRA does carve out employees
   “whose position[s] ha[ve] been determined to be of a confidential,
   policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.” But this

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   OPM, Docket ID (OPM-2025-0004), RIN (3206-AO80). I understand that the Trump
   Administration has issued a new policy that would make it easy to fire
   hundreds of thousands of federal employees and replace them with political
   loyalists. As a government contractor who works in medical research, and as
   someone who's already lost funding and months of wages due to the mass
   firings and funding cuts that support Veterans health and public health
   research, I'm appalled that this is even being considered. My work is
   grounded in evidence, guided by public health priorities, and intended to
   serve everyone—regardless of political affiliation. The ability to carry out
   this mission depends on a nonpartisan, merit-based civil service that values
   expertise and insulates scientific integrity from political pressures. On a
   personal level, this policy would make it difficult or impossible for my
   friends and collogues to continue working under DOD or NIH funded programs.

   some of these taxpayers after they had given praise for my work ethic and
   empathy towards the taxpayers that I had the pleasure to work with. Frankly,
   I was fantastic at my job, and I was absolutely an asset not only to the

   Hello, as a concerned citizen, I'd like to voice my opinion to the Office of
   Personnel Management on RIN 3206-AO80. I am deeply opposed to decreasing
   protections for civil servants positions. Like a lot of people, I didn't
   really think about how many vital services and functions were run by federal
   employees, because I took their steady, competent work for granted. In the
   last few months, seeing civil servant roles threatened and cut across the
   board, and jeopardizing key functions of normal life (getting returns on the
   money we paid into social security, taking care of our most vulnerable
   citizens, or getting help from an unbiased 3rd party in fraud cases), has
   highlighted how important they are. One thing that made me realize how bad
   even the threat of instability was was earlier this year when I watched a

   Rhetoric aside, the federal civil service is not bloated. 2 million people
   serve a population of 340 million people across the federal government

   think about them most of the time—other than when, as here, an administration

   political agendas—is a credit to their efficiency and competence. It is not
   easy to obtain a position as a career civil servant. The application process
   is grueling and hiring is competitive. While one must demonstrate competitive
   merit to obtain career federal employment, such jobs universally pay less

   Within the criteria for defining positions, the involvement in grant making
   appears misaligned with current practices and may be difficult to implement.
   At the very least, clarification over “discretion” and “discretionary” should
   be clarified and mapped to different grant-making approaches. For example,
   HHS grant policy uses Objective Review Panels to score grant applications,
   and participation in ORPs is largely an “other duty as assigned.” NOFOs also
   largely take direction from other places (laws, policies, directives, etc) in
   terms of language and specifics, and subject-matter experts may review or
   offer technical input. These actions could be considered discretionary, but
   they do not fit the intent behind this new Scheudle. Without better language,
   far too many positions will meet the criteria for inclusion. Also, rather

   Reclassifying federal employees to "Schedule F" or "Schedule Policy/Career"

   The proposed rule change, Schedule F, would catastrophically undermine the

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule “Improving
   Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service”
   (Document Number 2025-06904). This proposal, which seeks to reintroduce
   Schedule F, raises significant legal and ethical concerns that threaten the
   foundational principles of the federal civil service. Legal Concerns: 1.
   Contravention of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA): The CSRA
   established a merit-based system designed to protect federal employees from
   arbitrary actions and political coercion. By allowing for the
   reclassification of positions into Schedule F, thereby removing established
   civil service protections, the proposed rule undermines the intent of the
   CSRA and disrupts the balance of power between the executive branch and
   Congress. ￼ 2. The reintroduction of Schedule F exceeds presidential
   authority. Legal challenges that will follow such an enactment are both
   disruptive to essential operations but further make a moc

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I strongly oppose any effort to reinstate Schedule F in the federal
   workforce. This proposal threatens the foundational principles of a
   merit-based civil service, invites political interference, and risks
   violating statutory and constitutional protections. Schedule F would allow
   career civil servants to be hired and fired without the usual competitive
   processes or cause, undermining the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act and
   the protections enshrined in Title 5 of the U.S. Code. These laws exist to
   ensure that federal employment decisions are made on the basis of merit, not
   political loyalty. Such a reclassification also raises serious constitutional
   concerns. Career federal employees have a recognized property interest in
   their continued employment, and removing their due process rights could
   violate the Fifth Amendment. As the Supreme Court made clear in Loudermill
   (1985), these protections cannot be stripped away arbitrarily. Schedule F

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I am a current federal employee and strongly oppose the proposition to turn
   federal civil service employees into at-will employees for multiple reasons.
   First, such a proposition is extremely expensive and will cause unnecessary
   government spending waste. It is incredibly expensive to recruit, do
   background checks on, and train hired federal employees. If those employees
   were to be fired with every change in administration, all the money invested
   in them would be wasted. And then, would need to be spent again to rehire
   workers. It would be an endless cycle of unnecessary and wasteful spending.
   Second, the idea of turning federal civil service employees to at-will
   employees is flawed. As a federal employee, I do not serve at the will of the
   president, as I do not work for the president. I work for the American
   public. So to deem us "at-will", whose "will" are we specifically talking

   removal. This is not accountability, it is the institutionalization of

   They just want it to sound good so they can get the rule pushed through.

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   The goal of OPM and the proposed rule change is to make the federal
   government an at-will employer. In their argument, OPM cites a past FEVS
   survey shows high federal employee satisfaction and other mischaracterized
   data to support their claim for returning to the previous system that was in
   place prior to the Biden administration. This argument is in bad faith. Not
   only has OPM mischaracterized the FEVS survey results, but recently cancelled
   this years FEVS survey that was planned for this year because theu are aware
   of current employees sufferinf at the hands of OPM's draconian and illegal
   acts since January 2025. To use the FEVS survey results from the 1st Trump
   administration while actively silencing current federal employees shows that
   OPM has no interest in fact-based, data-driven decisions on the ground, but
   is instead pushing an ideological agenda ment to undermine the public sector

   government less effective, since they will need to be looking over their

   QUOTE: "...removing their statutory due process rights, is untenable."

   TRUNCATED TEXT (843 characters):
   Developing a new schedule of employees by executive order... And converting
   federal employees to this schedule, that would remove their statutory due
   process rights, is untenable. The CSRA bars expanding the confidential and
   policymaking designation beyond political appointees. The CSRA does not
   extend removal protections to “an employee whose position has been
   determined” by the President “to be of a confidential, policy-determining,
   policy-making, or policy-advocating character.” 16 But that phrase does not
   authorize the President to rove the executive branch for any employee who
   does substantive work. Instead, it has a specific meaning, established by the
   text and confirmed by years of unbroken practice: political appointees. Any
   effort to expand the reach of the exception beyond that settled meaning would
   be contrary to law.

   Subject: Public Comment on OPM-2025-0004-0001 – Concerns Regarding Compliance
   with Existing Laws and Negative Impacts on Federal Workers Dear Office of
   Personnel Management, As a current federal employee, I am writing to express
   deep concern regarding the proposed policy changes outlined in
   OPM-2025-0004-0001. These changes threaten to undermine both the integrity of
   the civil service and the foundational principles that protect and support

   removal of explicit prohibitions against discrimination based on gender
   identity—specifically through the elimination of the "Prohibition of
   Segregated Facilities" clause (FAR 52.222-21)—is deeply troubling. While the
   proposal suggests reliance on existing civil rights laws such as Title VII of
   the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the absence of these specific contractual
   protections weakens our ability to ensure safe, inclusive workplaces. As a

   “Improving Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil

   OPM cited a research paper, stating that "career Federal employees...advance

   a theoretical model, not observations from the real world. Moreover, the
   study dates back to 2007. OPM should cite more recent findings to back up
   their claim. Additionally, the following sentence states that "career
   employees perform less effectively under appointees they politically disagree

   not the entire civil service. The inline text mischaracterizes the study's
   findings and generalized a specific subset of workers to the entire Federal
   workforce. Finally, OPM should provide a citation on that same page when they

   To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to express my strong opposition to the
   Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) proposed rule titled “Improving
   Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service.” The
   proposal to reclassify policy-influencing positions as Schedule F
   (Policy/Career), making them at-will and exempt from standard adverse action
   procedures and appeals, is deeply concerning. While the administration
   asserts that this change will allow for the swift removal of employees who
   engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or intentionally subvert Presidential
   directives, the broad scope and potential for misuse of this authority
   outweigh the purported benefits. My own experience highlights the overreach
   of this proposed regulation. I previously held a federal position identified
   as potentially subject to this reclassification. I led scientists and oversaw
   the planning and execution of operations. Similarly, positions in my

   The recent funding cuts to key scientific agencies such as the National

   NSF, which played a pivotal role in the development of the internet,
   exemplifies the critical importance of sustained investment in foundational
   research—an importance that cannot be overstated. By reducing support for
   these institutions, the administration has effectively undermined its own
   stated priorities in advancing science and technology. These actions appear

   Do not politicize government civil service work. “Schedule F” (now renamed
   Schedule Policy/Career) is shorthand for an executive order that is a sharp
   break with civil service merit principles, which assume that career employees
   should be retained on the basis of performance and protected against
   political coercion. The US is already unusual in the degree to which it
   reserves the top layers of organizational leadership for short-term political
   appointees. Schedule F will vastly expand the number of appointees, adding a
   proposed 50,000 from the current 4000. It does so by involuntarily
   reclassifying career civil servants as appointees, removing job protections,
   the basic constraint against political interference. Studies show that
   politicization of public services generally worsens public-sector outcomes.
   Public employees invest less in developing their expertise and become more

   attachment_1.pdf] Comments on Proposed OPM Rule on “Schedule Policy/Career” I
   am submitting these comments in opposition to the Office of Personnel
   Management’s (OPM) proposed regulation “Schedule Policy/Career.” The proposed
   rule undermines more than 140 years of civil service reform following the
   spoils system. It opens the door to politically motivated firings and
   tramples on employees’ constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, the
   proposed regulation to dismantle civil service protections destabilizes the
   career workforce, politicizes the day- to- day work of government, and erodes
   the very idea of a professional, independent civil service. Specific concerns
   are presented below.  Performance: This proposal gives lip service to
   performance management, but rather than providing thoughtful reform, it
   weaponizes the classification of “policy-influencing” roles to make it easier
   to purge career staff.

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   I strongly oppose any efforts to revive or implement policies like Schedule
   F, which would unlawfully strip civil service protections from tens of
   thousands of career federal employees. Schedule F seeks to reclassify
   nonpartisan professionals as “confidential or policy-determining” employees—a
   designation reserved by law for political appointees—not for career staff
   carrying out the technical and administrative work of government. As detailed
   in the January 2025 Issue Brief from Governing for Impact, Schedule F
   attempts to circumvent longstanding merit-based hiring rules by creating a
   broad exception to civil service protections. This contradicts both the
   letter and the spirit of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which was
   enacted to prevent exactly this type of patronage-based employment. The law,
   and its consistent interpretation over decades, requires that federal
   employees be hired and retained based on merit—not politics. The proposed

   I am an academic researcher who has both received funding from the National
   Science Foundation and served on multiple peer-review boards for submitted
   proposals. It is essential that the administration of this very successful
   public funding of science research remain independent of the views of
   shifting political administrations, as noted when Congress passed the
   original National Science Foundation Act of 1950 (establishing NSF as an
   “independent agency”). Reclassifying administrator positions as falling under
   Schedule F, which would limit their decision-making to be in accord with
   whomever is currently the U.S. President, would severely compromise this
   important work. Progress in science is often slow, painstaking, and comes
   from the accretion of knowledge over many years with the contributions of

   I oppose this proposed rule because it allows any Administration to replace

   servants into a category of at-will employment makes those civil service
   positions vulnerable to political manipulation and influence, including by

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1000 characters):
   In October 2020, the Trump administration issued Executive Order 13957,
   creating a new classification within the federal workforce known as "Schedule
   F." This classification aimed to reclassify a significant number of career
   federal employees—particularly those in policy-related roles—as "excepted
   service," thereby stripping them of traditional civil service protections
   such as due process and merit-based hiring. Although this order was rescinded
   by President Joe Biden in January 2021, there has been renewed discussion and
   advocacy among certain political factions to reinstate Schedule F,
   potentially with even broader scope. Reinstating Schedule F would not only
   disrupt the long-standing principles of a professional, nonpartisan federal
   workforce, but it would also open the door to widespread political patronage,
   reduce institutional expertise, and erode public trust in government. At the

   TRUNCATED TEXT (999 characters):
   am writing in regards to the Office of Personnel Management, Docket ID:
   OPM-2025-0004, RIN 3206-AO80. The proposed rules change regarding procedures
   for taking action against civil servants is alarming. These changes are being
   proposed to make it easier to fire employees without cause and due process.
   Reclassifying a broad category of federal employees is a smokescreen for
   being able to fire employees for political reasons, not for "accountability"
   or "responsiveness." Competent and responsible government work is vital for
   the health of our country and its citizens. Firing 50,000 federal employees
   is going to permanently impact the trust that Americans have in their federal
   government. The vast majority of these employees are hard working and honest,
   and are doing their best every day, with little acclaim and low pay. For
   example, people near retirement age, like me, would like to know that workers
   in the Social Security Administration are experienced and qualified and able
   to help

   return a big piece of what is now the competitive civil service to the
   previous spoils system, a system with much incompetence and corruption. Trump
   has already shown his definition of competence is loyalty to him. Lacking
   competence himself, he has no criteria for defining competence, such as
   relevant experience, training, etc. I am opposed to this proposal. Contrary
   to the myth you can't fire a federal employee, as a supervisor and program
   director in Federal Civil Service with the Dept. of Veterans Affairs over a
   41+ year span of service I was responsible for the removal of 8 incompetent,
   and in one case criminal, civil service employees. There is a process one
   must follow, which is as it should be to insure employees have rights to due
   process and a fair hearing if they appeal. Terminating incompetent employees
   is actually good for employee morale as their peers always know who they are

   As a retired Federal employee, I am very concerned about the actions the
   administration has taken and intends to implement on executive departments.
   The idea of expanding the the number and type of positions that are
   appointed, and therefore political in nature, subverts the purpose of keeping
   the civil service and the professional experts hired to perform the work of
   the Federal agencies free from the kind of political pressure that President
   Trump is apparently trying to exert. The continuity of expertise and
   experience of the Federal workforce under the civil service system helps to
   ensure the quality, stability and efficiency necessary to operate the
   agencies and provide the public services that are their mission. The system
   is designed to ensure that the work and priorities of each agency are set by
   the policies of top political leadership appointed by the President and
   confirmed by Congress when required, but the management and workforce who

   fired “at will.” Further moving civil servants to a “political appointments”
   Schedule F status may cause persons to be hired as “yes” men rather based on

   TRUNCATED TEXT (555 characters):
   I strongly oppose the proposed Schedule F or "Schedule Policy/Career" rule.
   As a scientific researcher, I know that the proposed rule will seriously
   damage U.S. science and innovation. Scientists are needed to evaluate and
   make decisions regarding science, not political appointees. Scientists can
   implement less biased standards to support the integrity, credibility, and
   scientific rigorousness of federally-funded science. This leads to better
   science to help mankind and advance human knowledge. This would be hamstrung
   by replacing career scientists.

   TRUNCATED TEXT (907 characters):
   As a retired federal employee I'm angered that the government wants to take
   away any grievance rights from any employee management or bargaining unit
   employees. Removing civil service protections from loyal hard working
   employees is wrong. Protections from political interference is essential for
   the smooth operation of government agencies . If one goes back to understand
   why the Pendelton Civil Service Act was passed after President Garfield was
   shot the leaders realized political pressures must be removed . This way
   civil servants could be kept free from political interference while
   performing their jobs. Keep the civil service protections as they are now. I
   remember how I was called into the office for something that I was charged
   with that happened on my day off. I had the right to a hearing , without any
   civil service protections employees would be thrown out with out ant rights.

However, the reasons for the official's decisions/actions should be heard (due process) and assessed by an independent panel of peers with the same expertise, similar experience, from different areas (if possible outside the Government) like academia and industry."

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1649 characters):
   I am greatly concerned by this rule, which includes simply removing a high
   level official for questioning a directive from the Executive Branch of the
   Government. The high level official should be an expert on the topic covered
   by the agency with many years of experience, which should be the reason the
   high-level official was appointed to this position in the first place. The
   said official should have the best interest of the American People at heart
   above else. The Government, on the other hand, may have good intentions but
   act under ill-informed motives, possibly more on ideological than pragmatic
   grounds. As stated in the proposed rule, political affiliation can not be
   ground for appointment or dismissal, but this rule is a slippery slop toward
   placing blind loyalty above all. I do agree that an official who is hindering
   the efforts of the Government should be removed if this is done simply for
   personal or political reason. However, the reasons for the official's
   decisions/actions should be heard (due process) and assessed by an
   independent panel of peers with the same expertise, similar experience, from
   different areas (if possible outside the Government) like academia and
   industry, who can evaluate the facts and provide an open report to the
   American People. We, the People, have a right to know why someone who has
   been appointed based on merit and expertise is suddenly no longer capable of
   meeting the goals of the Agency. The section on Addressing Further Objections
   is not compelling and not supported by recent cabinet appointments being
   blatantly based more on loyalty than on merit and relevant
   expertise/experience.

   TRUNCATED TEXT (874 characters):
   The President's plan to implement Schedule F for civil servants in general
   and the NIH in particular is bad for the United States. The duties of civil
   servants should have a long time horizon. Retention of civil servants for
   their institutional knowledge, specialized expertise, and professionalism in
   the service of the United States is more valuable to the US taxpayer than
   allegiance to any political party or perceived indifference or even objection
   to the current administration. With regard to NIH, all Institute and Center
   Directors and their division directors and managers should be career civil
   servants and not become political appointees. In addition to politicizing the
   NIH, such a change would also increase the turnover of key positions,
   limiting longer-term planning and execution, increasing costs to the
   taxpayers and limiting what the NIH can achieve.

   TRUNCATED TEXT (1210 characters):
   I am a federal employee submitting this comment in my personal capacity. I
   strongly oppose this proposed rule for the reasons articulated in a prior
   comment by Angel Reyes (Comment ID OPM-2025-0004-7584). Effective and
   efficient government "depends on the ability of civil servants to offer
   independent legal and policy analysis without fear of political retaliation,"
   but "[t]his rule would undermine that independence." Addressing poor
   performance in the civil service can be accomplished without the negative
   consequences of this proposed rule. Additionally, the rule does nothing to
   address alleged poor performance among the much larger number of employees
   who do not occupy positions of "confidential, policy-determining,
   policy-making, or policy-advocating character." The under- and
   over-inclusiveness of the rule raises doubts about whether addressing poor
   performance is really the focus of this proposal. Finally, the proposed rule
   does not adequately consider the importance of job stability in recruiting
   skilled professionals who could earn higher salaries in the private sector. I
   urge OPM to withdraw the proposal and preserve the nonpartisan, expert-driven
   foundation of our civil service.
