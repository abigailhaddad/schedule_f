   Title: Comment from Leonard  Kahl
   Key Quote: "Schedule F seems a reasonable way of going, and if not, change it back in time."
   LLM Rationale: The comment explicitly supports the implementation of Schedule F, arguing that it is necessary for accountability and oversight of federal employees. The author expresses a belief that the current civil service system is outdated and abused, which aligns with the rule's goals.

   Full Text: This is very interesting. Every comment I browsed, maybe 20+, was against this regulation. And every comment except one, played the anti Trump, DOGE and Musk cards. This, alone, makes me think that Schedule F implementation is necessary. Something’s amiss here. If, as a Federal Government employee, you are immune to criticism, performance review, essentially any sort of oversight regarding your job, then of course you will be against Schedule F. What is wrong with justification of your salary an...

   Stance: Neutral/Unclear
   Title: Comment from Anonymous
   Key Quote: "This means that policy positions should only be at the senior executive service level or equivalent."
   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily provides a legal interpretation of Title 5 3132 regarding the Senior Executive Service and does not express a clear stance for or against the proposed rule. It focuses on the definitions and responsibilities associated with policy positions without addressing the implications of the proposed rule.

   Key Quote: "Obtaining precise answers to these questions is essential to assess whether Schedule F’s reclassification framework aligns with statutory mandates, protects employee rights, and maintains government effectiveness."
   LLM Rationale: The comment does not express a clear stance for or against the proposed rule but instead requests detailed information to evaluate its implications. It focuses on seeking clarity on various aspects of the rule rather than advocating for or opposing it.

   Full Text: Preamble
As an engaged citizen with direct experience in rule-making, I have no predisposed stance on the Schedule F proposal. To evaluate its legality, scope, and practical effects, I respectfully request detailed information on the rule’s design, implementation, and oversight. The following questions are intended to elicit clear, specific explanations that will inform a thorough legal analysis.

   Title: Comment from Janice Watkins
   Key Quote: "30 days does not provide a meaningful opportunity to comment, as required by 5 U.S.C. § 553(c), on this proposed rule."
   LLM Rationale: The comment primarily requests an extension of the comment period and does not express a clear stance for or against the proposed rule. It focuses on procedural concerns rather than the substance of the rule itself.
   Link: https://www.regulations.gov/comment/OPM-2025-0004-0185
   Full Text: 30 days does not provide a meaningful opportunity to comment, as required by 5 U.S.C. § 553(c), on this proposed rule. 30 days is generally only considered sufficient when the rulemaking is not significant. This would be a change to how the government operates, and as such is not insignificant. Furthermore, access to this rule will be unavailable from 5 pm today through the weekend, effectively reducing the comment period by days.

   Full Text: Bottom line: the new proposed act could cause future legal challenges, using the 1st, 5th, and 14th amendments, based upon OPM’s interpretation of the Administrative Procedure Act.  It may be wise to either reconsider / address, or at the very least, strength the OPM’s argument that the President should have unlimited and unrestricted control, (ie: without legal oversight), if future legal challenges wish to be prevented.

   Full Text: Although he was elected, can we fire President Donald Trump?  He doesn't care about the average American except to get their vote or hold a rally to feed his narcism.  However, that's not what you want to hear, is it?  Ok.  Maybe start Secretary Hegseth because of his incompetency, but wait...the all-knowing Donald hand picked Petey, right?  Geeze, you guys must have a big circle jerk going on.
