This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file. 
Please note that .ico files are binary and can't be created directly through text editing.

You'll need to:
1. Save the SVG file we created
2. Use an online converter (like favicon.io) to generate an .ico file
3. Replace this placeholder with the actual .ico file
