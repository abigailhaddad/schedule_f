The underlying logic of this proposal is that, 1) all federal employees, no matter where they are located or what they do, must first and foremost be loyal to the President. This is, of course, patently ridiculous. 2) It implies that anyone can do any Federal employee's job; there is no requirement for institutional knowledge or specialization, or years of experience. This, too, is patently ridiculous. Federal employees hold positions ranging from lower-level (security guards and janitors, for example) to highly educated and experienced roles (research scientists and administrators). In any of these roles, Federal employees need to first perform the duties of the position to the level expected in their performance documents. As part of that review process, they should not be working against the government, no matter who the President is at the time. However, allegiance to that President above all else, as implied here, is UNAMERICAN and ACONSITUIONAL.\n\nIf implemented, it would move us further into authoritarianism with Federal employees whose allegiance, rather than skill, earns them employment. It would weaken services and disrupt our national security. None of this improves Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service; rather, it would destroy the Civil Service.",

      "comment": "I object to OPM's proposed new rule that would reclassify 50,000 federal workers to \"at-will\" employees. \"At-will\" employment will make it easier to fire any employee for political rather than merit-based reasons. Under \"at-will\" employment, no reason is required for termination. And, there is little recourse for appeal. \n\nUS civil servants are not political appointees and as such are not subject to removal by Presidential authority. The Civil Service was established to create a professional, non-partisan workforce rather than one based on cronyism. Fealty to the President and his agenda should never be a condition of civil service employment and yet, this is exactly what this proposed regulation seeks to establish. The regulation authors say the reclassification will make it easier to fire employees for \"intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\" This is moving our government further in the direction of a dictatorship. This reclassification effort is a huge over-reach by the Executive Branch which will undermine the federal workforce and reduce public trust in government. \n\nAnother reason given for changing civil servants to at-will employees is that the current protections employees enjoy (e.g., a fair workplace) purportedly makes it difficult \"to hold employees accountable.\" If that is the case, improve the evaluation system. \n\nThe drafters of this rule assert that \"positions will remain career jobs filled on a non-partisan basis.\" This is a disingenuous claim. At-will employment undermines career employment. Job security and due process for employees are critical assurances to those who seek a career job in the federal government. These do not rule out a robust training and evaluation program to ensure good job performance. \n\nIn addition, the assertion that one can be fired without due process for \"intentionally subverting Presidential directives\" undermines the professional, non-partisan character of civil service positions. The message is clear. Obey or be gone. No professional person would choose to work under such conditions. Our government has long upheld model employment regulations. Let's not abandon our commitment to a fair working conditions for a President's political gain.",

Chan School of Public Health. As a researcher with extensive experience in the NIH grant system, I am writing to express significant concerns regarding the section of the proposed rule that designates employees with \"substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking\" as potentially occupying \"policymaking positions\" that could be reclassified under Schedule Policy/Career.\n\nSpecific Concerns with the Proposed Rule\n\nThe proposed rule identifies grant-making as \"an important form of policymaking\" and suggests that employees with \"substantive discretionary role in how federal funding gets allocated may occupy policymaking positions.\" This characterization fundamentally misunderstands the scientific grant review process at agencies like NIH and NSF, which rely on scientific merit and peer review rather than political considerations.\n\nThe stated purpose of this rule is to allow agencies to \"quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.\" When applied to scientific grant-making, this creates a dangerous framework that could politicize what should be an independent, merit-based process.\n\nEvidence-Based Arguments\n\nThe primacy of American scientific research in the world depends on insulating technical grant review from political influence:\n\n1. NIH and NSF grant review processes are designed to fund the most scientifically promising research through rigorous peer review. The NIH is \"arguably the most important institution shaping the rate and direction of scientific research\" with significant implications for human well-being. Even small changes to how funding is allocated could have massive effects on social welfare.\n\n2. International examples demonstrate the severe consequences when politics interferes with scientific funding decisions. Soviet biology, which had achieved peak prominence by the mid-1930s, was essentially ruined by Lysenko's politically-backed campaign against genetics (Ptushenko, Genetics, 2021). The damage was so profound that even after Lysenkoism was officially renounced in 1964, it took decades for Russian science to recover from this political interference.\n\n3. Similarly, in countries like China where \"personal relationships have affected government decisions, such as the review of scientific grants,\" scientific integrity issues have damaged progress despite massive investments (Zeng et al. Dev World Bioeth, 2010). Studies indicate that politicization of science funding leads to inefficient allocation of resources, limiting China's ability to achieve global scientific leadership commensurate with its spending (Shu et al. Minerva, 2022; Yu et al. Res Policy, 2022).\n\n4. The existing peer review system, while imperfect, provides important guardrails against bias. These decisions should be made by scientific experts, not political appointees.\n\nSpecific Recommendations for Improvement\n\nI propose the following improvements to the rule:\n\n1. Explicitly exclude scientific grant review personnel at NIH, NSF, and similar research agencies from the Schedule Policy/Career designation. Scientific merit review is a technical function, not a political one.\n\n2. Provide a clear, narrow definition of what constitutes \"substantive discretionary authority\" in grant-making that distinguishes between technical evaluation based on scientific merit (which should remain protected) and truly discretionary policy decisions.\n\n3. Add specific safeguards ensuring the independence of scientific peer review committees from political interference, including explicit protections for review panel members.\n\n4. Require transparency in any actions that would redesignate positions related to scientific grant review, including advance notice and comment periods specific to each affected role.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile improving accountability in government service is a worthwhile goal, applying at-will employment status to scientific grant-making personnel poses significant risks to American scientific leadership. The independence of the scientific grant-making process from political influence has been a cornerstone of American research excellence and must be preserved.",

This proposal threatens the merit-based civil service system that has underpinned a professional, nonpartisan federal workforce for over a century.\n\nFirst and foremost, the creation of Schedule F directly undermines the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which was enacted to combat the spoils system and establish a merit-based hiring process for federal employees. By allowing a broad swath of career civil servants\u2014particularly those involved in policy-making or analysis\u2014to be reclassified and potentially terminated without cause, Schedule F opens the door to politically motivated hiring and firing. This is antithetical to the principle of an apolitical civil service enshrined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(8), which mandates that federal employment decisions be based on merit and free from political influence.\n\nMoreover, the vague and sweeping criteria for inclusion in Schedule F violate the due process protections guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513, which requires cause and procedural safeguards for the removal of career federal employees. Stripping thousands of workers of these protections not only weakens accountability but also risks chilling expert advice and dissent within agencies\u2014undermining the very effectiveness of government operations.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is also bound by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. to support the merit system principles. Implementing Schedule F contradicts this statutory mission and places undue political pressure on career professionals, compromising the integrity and continuity of federal programs across administrations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Schedule F proposal poses a grave threat to the foundational principles of good governance, civil service independence, and the rule of law.

This rule will strip job protections from thousands of federal workers, allowing them to be fired at any time, without cause, including the very administrative judges tasked with enforcing job protections for federal employees. Under the guise of promoting accountability, this rule makes it easier to fire employees not only for poor performance or misconduct, but also for not toeing the ideological party line of the current president. This rule will remove the safeguards that protected the non-partisan nature of the federal workforce, allowing Democrats to serve under Republican presidents and Republicans to keep serving and doing their jobs for the American people under Presidents Obama and Biden. This will undermine Americans' trust that our federal government is working for all of us, regardless of party and ideology.",

        "comment": "As a federal employee, a Foreign Service Officer in the Department of State for over 25 years, I am appalled at the idea of expanding political appointees in the USG any further than they already exist.  The idea of an entire corps of officers whose loyalty is to the president and political party in power rather than to the oath to defend, protect and uphold the U.S. Constitution is an abomination. After having worked with foreign governments in a variety of countries (Kenya, Nigeria, Venezuela, Panama, Belgium, India) I can assert with great confidence that the countries with the weakest governance (Kenya, Nigeria, Venezuela and Panama) had weak or non-existent civil service employees.  In Panama, after every election, virtually the entire employee roster, from janitors to Ministers, changed, leaving no institutional memory and a new group of employees who often had no idea what to do or how to do it and who spent most of their time undoing what their predecessors had done rather than advance the agenda of the current president.  One of the major saving graces in India, for example, is an extremely strong civil service.  There are highly competitive exams for the Indian Administrative Service, the Indian Police Service and the Indian Foreign Service and members of the IAS, the IPS or the IFS cannot even vote in elections until they retire.  If nothing else, it keeps government administration focused on governing and not on implementing the whims of the current government for fear of losing their jobs.  \n\nApart from that consideration, it should be crystal clear that the loyalty oaths required of the new \"Schedule F\" employees would likely be written in the vaguest possible terms, so that virtually anyone who doesn't meet the definition of \"loyalty\" demanded by someone farther up the ranks from them would be cashiered.  Not only would this lack of protection ensure that the employee's loyalty would be to an individual politician, rather than to defend, protect and uphold the U.S. Constitution, it would also lead to disruption of government functioning, as employees not considered sufficiently \"loyal\" could be fired at whim, leaving gaping holes for key responsibilities.\n\nWe're not a dictatorship . . . yet.  Schedule F is a huge step towards becoming one.  ",
