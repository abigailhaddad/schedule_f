   TRUNCATED TEXT (487 characters):
   ‬ ‭ The‬‭ CSRA‬‭ bars‬‭ expanding‬‭ the‬‭ confidential‬‭ and‬‭ policymaking‬‭
   designation‬‭ beyond‬‭ political‬ ‭ appointees.‬ Federal‬‭ civil‬‭
   servants,‬‭ once‬‭ granted‬‭ CSRA‬‭ protections,‬‭ may‬‭ not‬‭ be‬‭ fired‬‭
   (or‬ ‭ otherwise‬‭ deprived‬‭ of‬‭ their‬‭ CSRA‬‭ rights)‬‭ without‬‭
   procedures‬‭ closely‬‭ tracking‬‭ those‬‭ the‬ ‭ CSRA‬‭ requires.‬‭ This
   proposal,‬‭ by‬‭ stripping numerous‬‭ civil‬‭ servants‬‭ of‬‭ their‬‭ tenure‬
   ‭ protections, blatantly violates that rule.‬
