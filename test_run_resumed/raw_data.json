You're talking about removing 50,000 career public servants to replace them with unqualified Trump supporters?\n\nThe purpose of government civil servants is to work for the benefit of the American people, not one want-to-be dictator. I don't understand how the GOP can support this man who is so against the Constitution and the will of the American people.\n\nBad idea. No thank you.",

      "comment": "this is a terrible idea. The underlying logic of this proposal is that, 1) all federal employees, no matter where they are located or what they do, must first and foremost be loyal to the President. This is, of course, patently ridiculous. 2) It implies that anyone can do any Federal employee's job; there is no requirement for institutional knowledge or specialization, or years of experience. This, too, is patently ridiculous. Federal employees hold positions ranging from lower-level (security guards and janitors, for example) to highly educated and experienced roles (research scientists and administrators). In any of these roles, Federal employees need to first perform the duties of the position to the level expected in their performance documents. As part of that review process, they should not be working against the government, no matter who the President is at the time. However, allegiance to that President above all else, as implied here, is UNAMERICAN and ACONSITUIONAL.\n\nIf implemented, it would move us further into authoritarianism with Federal employees whose allegiance, rather than skill, earns them employment. It would weaken services and disrupt our national security. None of this improves Performance, Accountability, and Responsiveness in the Civil Service; rather, it would destroy the Civil Service.",

      "comment": "The Schedule F/Policy and Career reclassification plans outlined in this new regulation, Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service, do not achieve the goals outlined in the regulations. 1) The policy categories as defined (policy advocating, influencing) apply to literally the entire government workforce, and therefore, it becomes a lottery of who is selected for this reclassification. Recent leaked Schedule F lists from NOAA disproportionately identify scientists and science leadership, rather than people who make policy! 2) Accountability must apply across the board and not just middle-management, which is what this will ultimately affect not the low performing employee, but likely the high performing boss of that employee, concurrently, very senior leadership or senior executives will engage in self preservation will be further politicized and become corrupt and divorced from the mission. All you will get is a fearful and incompetent workforce, which is perhaps what this regulation aims to do, and 3) Due process is built into every regulation/law in the United States, and violating the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) covering due process.

This is a hatchet job on hard-working public servants, with the end goal of removing anyone who has the seniority, know-how, and will to resist illegal executive overreach.  \n\nBut you already know that, don't you? That's why it's happening.\n\nI utterly oppose this proposed new rule; I call for the OPM to withdraw it and, instead, make some attempt to follow existing legal and procedural guidelines for classifying--and, when necessary but ONLY when necessary, removing--federal employees.

The proposed rule is excellent, and provides well-considered protections against the dangers posed by politicization. In particular, the previously signed Schedule F Executive Order represents the greatest threat to the system of merit embedded in the American civil service system since its inception.\n\nIt is impotent to have a functioning government that employees involved in the day to day workings of said government remain constant and not be subject to firing because of their political views. That\u2019s not why these people took these jobs. They\u2019re the ones who keep things moving. We\u2019re seeing what happens when this current administration politicizes leadership by only appointing those who would follow commands ignoring the Constitution and due process of law. This isn\u2019t healthy for a democratic republic. Schedule F would attempt to make this government wide thus destroying any semblance of a democratic institution. ",

This \nregulation, which seeks to establish a new \"Schedule Policy/Career\" classification within \nthe excepted service, is a direct threat to the integrity, independence, and democratic \nfoundation of the U.S. civil service.  \nThis proposal is not a minor administrative adjustment; it is a sweeping and dangerous \ntransformation of how federal personnel are hired, retained, and dismissed. Below are five \ncritical reasons why this rule must be withdrawn.  \n1. Erosion of Due Process and Merit Protections  \nThe proposed regulation, which would create a new \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d \nclassification within the excepted service, directly contradicts the foundational principles \nof a merit -based civil service. It would allow thousands of career federal employee s, those \nlabeled as \u201cpolicy -influencing\u201d , to be stripped of the rights and protections afforded under \nTitle 5 of the U.S. Code. These individuals could be terminated without cause, without \nnotice, and without recourse , removing the procedural safeguards that ha ve long protected \nthe integrity of our nonpartisan civil service.  \nThis is fundamentally at odds with the stated intentions of Executive Order titled Restoring \nEquality of Opportunity and Meritocracy  (April 2025). That EO opens with a powerful \naffirmation:  \n\u201cA bedrock principle of the United States is that all citizens are treated equally under \nthe law... It encourages meritocracy... not favoritism.\u201d (Sec. 1)  \nFurther, it underscores the importance of evaluating individuals based on \u201cindividual \nstrengths, effort, or achievement\u201d and explicitly warns against systems that undermine \nopportunities for individuals to succeed on their own merits:  \n\u201cDisparate -impact liability... has hindered businesses from making hiring and other \nemployment decisions based on merit and skill...\u201d (Sec. 1)  \nYet this proposed rule moves in the opposite direction. It does not encourage meritocracy, \nbut instead replaces it with political discretion. It does not promote equal opportunity, but \ninstead allows for arbitrary dismissal based on a shifting and opaque d efinition of \u201cpolicy \ninfluence.\u201d This directly undermines the very goal of treating individuals based on \u201ctheir \nstrengths, effort, or achievement.\u201d  \nIf the administration is sincere in its belief that:  \n\u201cEmployers should be able to use bona fide job -oriented evaluations when \nrecruiting,\u201d  \u2014 Section 1, Purpose  \nthen it cannot support a system in which qualified, experienced, and competent civil \nservants are denied job security , not because of performance or misconduct, but because \nthey occupy roles that may be politically inconvenient . \nIf the administration is committed to promoting individual merit, equal treatment under the \nlaw, and protection from arbitrary decision -making, then this proposed rule is an \nundeniable contradiction. The \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d rule removes employment \nprotections from qualified, experienced, and loyal civil servants, many of whom have \ndedicated their careers to upholding the law, regardless of political party.  \nRather than advancing meritocracy, this rule promotes ideological conformity by allowing \nfor the removal of employees based on perceived political misalignment , turning a system \ngrounded in qualifications and expertise into one vulnerable to favoritism and political \ncoercion.  \nMoreover, the rule would expose many employees to termination simply because they hold \npolicy-related responsibilities , not because of poor performance, lack of merit, or legal \nmisconduct, but because of where their role sits within an organizational chart.  \nThe President\u2019s own Executive Order recognizes:  \n\u201cCitizens will be treated equally before the law and as individuals, not consigned to \na certain fate based on their immutable characteristics.\u201d (Sec. 1)  \nYet this regulation, by categorizing certain roles as inherently subject to political will, \neffectively consigns public servants to professional instability and career vulnerability \u2014not \nbased on individual merit or misconduct, but based on administrative d esignation and \nperceived policy influence.  \nAt its core, this rule trades merit for loyalty, skill for silence, and due process for political \ncontrol. It is incompatible with the values enshrined in the American civil service system as \na whole.  \nThis is not meritocracy.  \nThis is not due process.  \nAnd this is not equality under the law.  \nThe Office of Personnel Management should uphold the merit system principles codified in \nlaw and reaffirmed by executive action. I urge OPM to withdraw this proposed rule in its \nentirety.  \n2. Politicization of the Civil Service  \nThe proposed regulation grants the President unprecedented authority to unilaterally \nreclassify a wide range of federal positions into a new category  called \u201cSchedule \nPolicy/Career\u201d  and effectively stripping those roles of the statutory protections that ensure \na nonpartisan, merit -based federal workforce. This move would mark a radical shift in the \ncivil service system by enabling the wholesale replacement of experienced professionals \nbased not on performance or legal violations, but on perceived political alignment.  \nThis fundamentally politicizes the federal workforce, blurring the essential distinction \nbetween career civil servants , who are charged with implementing the law faithfully , and \npolitical appointees, who serve at the pleasure of the President.  \nThis regulation directly undermines several pillars of U.S. law:  \nTitle 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 \u2013 Merit System Principles  \nThe federal merit system is governed by nine core principles, including:  \n1. \u201cRecruitment should be from qualified individuals from appropriate sources in an \nendeavor to achieve a workforce from all segments of society.  \n2. \u201cSelection and advancement should be determined solely on the basis of relative \nability, knowledge, and skills after fair and open competition.\"  \n3. \u201cEmployees should be protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or \ncoercion for partisan political purposes.\u201d  \nReclassifying policy -influencing roles into an at -will category contradicts every one of these \nprinciples by removing fair competition, merit -based selection, and protection from \npolitical coercion.  \nTitle 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302 \u2013 Prohibited Personnel Practices  \nThis law explicitly prohibits:  \n\u2022 \u201cAny personnel action based on political affiliation or conduct.\u201d  \n\u2022 \u201cAny action that violates merit system principles.\u201d  \nUnder this rule, civil servants in roles like policy analysis, grant oversight, and scientific \nevaluation could be terminated or reassigned solely because their professional \nrecommendations differ from the political objectives of the current administration . This is \nthe very type of action Congress sought to prevent when it codified protections against \npolitical abuse in the civil service.  \nPublic trust in federal agencies depends on their independence, professionalism, and \nconsistency across administrations. This regulation opens the door to loyalty tests, where \ncontinued employment depends on agreement with political priorities , not legal obligation, \nscientific evidence, or expert judgment. That would:  \n\u2022 Chill dissent and innovation  \n\u2022 Deter qualified professionals from public service  \n\u2022 Concentrate power in the Executive  \n\u2022 Replace institutional expertise with ideological conformity  \nIn practice, this means public affairs officers could be fired for not echoing political talking \npoints, scientists removed for reporting inconvenient findings, or regulatory experts purged \nfor upholding laws the administration seeks to weaken.  \nBy eroding this firewall between policy implementation and political will, the proposed rule \nignores the delicate constitutional balance between administration of the law and political \nleadership. This sets a precedent where federal employment is contingen t not on expertise \nor lawfulness, but on political loyalty , an arrangement more characteristic of authoritarian \nregimes than democratic societies.  \nIn a constitutional republic, the law , not the preferences of the President , must guide \nagency action. The civil service exists precisely to ensure continuity, competence, and \naccountability across changing political leadership.  \nThis rule would instead bring us one step closer to a patronage system that the Pendleton \nAct of 1883 , and every merit -based reform since  has sought to eliminate.  \nBy granting the President sweeping authority to reclassify roles into this new category, the \nregulation politicizes positions that are meant to remain nonpartisan. From regulatory \nanalysts and grant administrators to public affairs officers and scientists,  a wide range of \nprofessionals could be targeted for their beliefs or actions  undermining the essential \nindependence of federal agencies.  \nThis concentration of power in the executive branch is incompatible with democratic \nprinciples and opens the door to loyalty tests, purges, and the erosion of public trust in \ngovernment.  \nThis proposed rule is not a technical reclassification ; it is a fundamental restructuring of \nthe civil service that threatens the nonpartisan foundation of our federal government. It \ndirectly contradicts the core merit principles codified in federal law and undermines the \nvery goals set forth in the April 2025 Executive Order on Restoring Equality of Opportunity \nand Meritocracy , which promotes individual merit, constitutional adherence, and equal \ntreatment under the law.  \nInstead of advancing those principles, this rule invites political interference, weakens legal \nsafeguards, and destabilizes the institutions designed to serve the American people with \nimpartiality and integrity.  \nFor the sake of our democracy, our public institutions, and our Constitution, I urge the \nOffice of Personnel Management to rescind this rule in its entirety. At a minimum, \nsubstantial revisions must be made to:  \n\u2022 Reinstate full due process protections for all reclassified employees  \n\u2022 Limit the scope of reclassification to true political appointees  \n\u2022 Ensure compliance with Title 5 merit system principles and prohibited personnel \npractices  \n\u2022 Include explicit language protecting civil servants from political retaliation  \nAnything less risks transforming our civil service into a tool of political enforcement . \n3. Threat to Whistleblowers and Good Governance  \nOne of the most alarming implications of the proposed \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d \nclassification is its potential to erode critical whistleblower protections, undermining \nethical oversight and insulating the executive branch from lawful accountability.  \nUnder the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA), codified in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8), \nfederal employees are protected from retaliation when they disclose evidence of:  \n\u2022 A violation of law, rule, or regulation,  \n\u2022 Gross mismanagement,  \n\u2022 Gross waste of funds,  \n\u2022 An abuse of authority,  \n\u2022 Or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.  \nHowever, these protections explicitly exclude employees in \u201cconfidential, policy -\ndetermining, policymaking, or policy -advocating positions\u201d , a category that directly \noverlaps with the proposed definition of \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d roles.  \nBy reclassifying large swaths of the federal workforc e, especially those engaged in \nregulatory, scientific, and policy oversight , this regulation could render thousands of civil \nservants ineligible for whistleblower protection. This would not only silence those best \npositioned to identify misconduct or illegality but also send a chilling message throughout \nthe entire federal workforce: Speak up, and you may be punished without recourse.  \nThe proposed rule would functionally undermine several critical components of the federal \naccountability system:  \n1. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9) \u2013 Retaliation Protections  \nThis statute protects employees who exercise appeal rights, cooperate with investigations, \nor refuse to obey orders that would require them to break the law. Those protections could \nbe bypassed if agencies can simply reclassify employees as at -will.  \n2.  Inspector General Act of 1978  \nFederal Inspectors General (IGs) rely on the willingness of employees to report misconduct \nwithout fear of reprisal. Removing these protections discourages cooperation and weakens \nthe independence of the IG system.  \n3.  Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)  \nThe MSPB is tasked with hearing appeals from employees who claim they\u2019ve been subject \nto unlawful retaliation. If \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d employees are stripped of MSPB \naccess, there is no impartial forum to adjudicate whistleblower claims.  \nThe federal government depends on courageous, principled civil servants to report when \npolicies are being broken, funds are being misused, or the public interest is being betrayed. \nThese individuals have exposed:  \n\u2022 Corruption in federal contracts  \n\u2022 Unsafe practices in public health  \n\u2022 Suppression of scientific data  \n\u2022 Discrimination and abuse within agencies  \nSilencing those voices does not promote efficiency \u2014it protects misconduct.  By weakening \nwhistleblower protections through broad reclassification, this rule:  \n\u2022 Makes fraud, waste, and abuse harder to detect  \n\u2022 Discourages good -faith reporting of legal violations  \n\u2022 Creates a culture of fear, secrecy, and blind loyalty  \n\u2022 Undermines the American public\u2019s right to honest government  \nIn a healthy democracy, government accountability begins with those on the inside willing \nto speak truth to power. The proposed rule endangers that principle by removing key \nprotections for those most likely to encounter wrongdoing. It rewards silence and punishes \nintegrity, turning a system designed to serve the people into one that protects power at all \ncosts.  \nThis is not good governance ; it is a recipe for unchecked executive abuse. I urge the Office \nof Personnel Management to withdraw or amend this rule to explicitly preserve \nwhistleblower protections for all civil servants, regardless of their role in shaping or \ncommunicating policy.  \n4. Undermining Checks and Balances  \nThe proposed rule not only dismantles protections for civil servants but also alters the \nbalance of power between the branches of government, weakening core institutions \ndesigned to enforce lawful governance and prevent abuse. By granting the Executive \nBranch broad authority to unilaterally reclassify federal roles into \u201cSchedule Policy/Career ,\u201d \nthe regulation effectively bypasses Congress, undermines existing statutory frameworks, \nand eliminates essential institutional safeguards. This action centralizes power in the \nhands of the President in a way that is inconsistent with the constitutional principle of \nseparation of powers.  \nThis regulation directly undermines several pillars of U.S. law  and the Constitution : \nU.S. Constitution \u2013 Article I, Section 8  \nCongress holds the power to \u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for \ncarrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.\u201d That includes authority over civil service \nstructures, personnel rules, and the administrative framework of federal agencies. By \noverriding long -standing statutory frameworks through regulatory action alone, the \nExecutive is unilaterally reshaping a system Congress established and maintains.  \nTitle 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204 \u2013 Powers and Functions of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)  \nThe MSPB is an independent agency tasked with ensuring merit system principles are \nupheld, adjudicating appeals of personnel actions, and protecting against prohibited \npersonnel practices. The proposed rule strips thousands of employees of access to MSPB \nappeals, effectively defanging the agency and bypassing the enforcement mechanisms \nCongress created.  \nTitle 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521 \u2013 Protections for Administrative Law Judges (ALJs)  \nAdministrative judges  who oversee regulatory, enforcement, and benefits hearings across \nthe federal government  are insulated from removal except for \u201cgood cause\u201d as determined \nby the MSPB. The proposed rule could place these judges under Schedule Policy/Career, \nallowing their termination without cause or independent review, thus violating statutory \nprotections and threatening the impartiality of legal proceedings across agencies.  \nIndependent administrative bodies like the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Office of \nSpecial Counsel, and agency -level adjudicative offices serve as vital bulwarks against \npolitical interference. They exist to ensure:  \n\u2022 That personnel decisions are made lawfully,  \n\u2022 That whistleblower protections are enforced,  \n\u2022 And that citizens receive impartial decisions in disputes involving government \nbenefits, enforcement, and regulation.  \nThe proposed rule threatens all of this by granting the President unchecked authority over \nappointments and terminations in roles critical to checks and balances, rule of law, and \ncitizen recourse.  \nThe danger of executive overreach in federal employment has been well understood since \nthe passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which abolished the \npatronage \u201cspoils system.\u201d Congress enacted these reforms after it became clear that \nallowing elected officials to fire and hire federal employees for political reasons eroded \npublic trust and opened the door to corruption.  \nThis rule is a step back toward that dangerous model. It transforms roles that should be \nneutral, professional, and governed by law into positions that serve at the pleasure of a \npolitical leader , exposing our administrative institutions to manipulation, intimidation, and \ninstability.  \nThe result would be an Executive Branch that not only administers policy but also controls \nall institutional resistance to unlawful conduct, a scenario the framers of our Constitution \nexplicitly sought to avoid.  \nIn our constitutional system, no branch of government should be able to exercise \nunchecked power, particularly over the mechanisms of enforcement, oversight, and \nadjudication. The proposed rule undermines these checks and balances by concentrating \npersonnel contr ol in the Executive and disabling independent bodies meant to constrain it.  \nIf enacted, this rule would not only jeopardize the integrity of the civil service but also erode \nthe constitutional structure that protects individual rights and democratic governance.  \nI urge OPM to withdraw or significantly amend this rule to ensure alignment with the \nConstitution, federal statutes, and the principles of independent, impartial public service.  \n5. A Step Toward Authoritarianism  \nThe creation of the \u201cSchedule Policy/Career\u201d classification is not merely a bureaucratic \nadjustment ; it is a structural shift in governance that would bring the United States \nalarmingly close to the systems of control found in authoritarian regimes. By enabling the \nPresident to unilaterally reclassify and dismiss career federal employees who engage in \npolicy, regulatory, or communications work, this rule dismantles one of the last remaining \nbulwarks against executive overreach: a nonpartisan, professional c ivil service.  \nIn a healthy constitutional democracy, federal employees are expected to serve the public, \nuphold the law, and execute the policies of the elected government without regard to party, \nideology, or personality. The civil service is structured to ensure that public administration \nis guided by:  \n\u2022 Professional expertise  \n\u2022 Continuity across administrations  \n\u2022 Fidelity to laws passed by Congress  \nThis proposal threatens to replace that professionalism with loyalty tests, where \nemployment is contingent not on competence or compliance with law \u2014but on personal \nallegiance to a President or administration.  \nHistory offers chilling reminders of where this leads. Regimes that elevate personal loyalty \nabove lawful governance inevitably breed corruption, suppress dissent, and erode the \nrights of citizens. What begins as administrative restructuring quickly become s a tool of \npolitical purification , and the consequences for democracy are profound.  \nBefore the Pendleton Act of 1883, federal jobs were awarded based on political patronage. \nPresidents routinely purged civil servants to make room for loyalists, ensuring that \ngovernment agencies became extensions of partisan machinery. The result was insta bility, \ncorruption, and a public administration that served power , not people.  \nThe Pendleton Act and later reforms were not accidental ; they were deliberate safeguards \nagainst autocracy. Repealing those protections in the form of this proposed rule does not \nmerely revert us to a less efficient system. It dismantles over a century of hard -won reforms \ndesigned to protect democracy itself.  \nThis rule undermines the constitutional principle of checks and balances, concentrates \nundue power in the Executive Branch, and enables the systematic removal of individuals \nwho may resist illegal or unethical orders.  \nIt also directly contradicts principles articulated in landmark rulings and documents, such \nas: \nFederalist No. 51: \u201cAmbition must be made to counteract ambition.\u201d The founders \nunderstood the need for internal restraints within government to preserve liberty.  \nMyers v. United States (1926) and Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States (1935): \nThese cases drew lines around the President\u2019s removal powers, affirming limits in \ncontexts where independence is essential.  \nThe Civil Service Reform Act of 1978: This law reaffirmed Congress\u2019s intent to \nprotect employees from arbitrary political retaliation and to ensure a career \nworkforce that could serve any administration impartially.  \nOnce politicized, the federal workforce becomes a tool not of democratic administration, \nbut of personal rule. This regulation could:  \n\u2022 Be used to silence dissenting internal voices  \n\u2022 Enable mass firings based on ideology  \n\u2022 Lead to the collapse of public confidence in government agencies  \n\u2022 Empower future presidents to govern without oversight  \nWhat results is a government that serves the President , not the people, and that structure \nis no longer a republic in any meaningful sense.  \nThe United States was never meant to be ruled by a king. Our founders fought a revolution \nto reject unchecked executive power. This regulation moves us closer to the very system \nthey sought to replace.  \nIf the civil service can be purged at will, based on vague and sweeping criteria, then the \ninstitutions meant to preserve democracy become weapons to destroy it.  \nWe must not allow that to happen. The proposed rule must be withdrawn completely or \nradically revised to prevent its abuse by any present or future administration.  \nConclusion and Call to Action  \nThis regulation is incompatible with the laws, principles, and values that define the U.S. \ngovernment. It erodes merit, eliminates accountability, and opens the federal workforce to \npolitical exploitation.  \nI urge the Office of Personnel Management to rescind this rule in its entirety. If any \nelements are retained, they must be significantly amended to:  \n\u2022 Preserve full due process and appeal rights;  \n\u2022 Protect whistleblowers and independent adjudicators;  \n\u2022 Reinforce merit -based hiring and promotion;  \n\u2022 Prevent political retaliation;  \n\u2022 Uphold statutory checks and constitutional balances.  \nWithdraw this rule. Protect our civil service. Preserve our democracy.  \nRespectfully,  \nFree State Coalition",

      "comment": "I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed rule that would create a new Schedule Policy/Career category of federal employment, which would convert existing career civil service roles into effectively at-will positions. This proposal poses a direct threat to the integrity, stability, and nonpartisan nature of the federal civil service.\nThe current protections in place for career employees are not barriers\u2014they are essential safeguards that ensure federal workers can carry out their duties based on evidence, expertise, and the public interest, free from political retaliation or undue influence. Removing these protections risks politicizing critical policy-making roles and undermining the impartiality that is foundational to good governance.\nWhile misconduct and poor performance must be addressed, the existing civil service framework already provides mechanisms to do so. Weakening due process rights under the guise of improving accountability will only erode trust, morale, and institutional knowledge across federal agencies. Furthermore, conflating dissent or policy-based disagreement with \"undermining the democratic process\" sets a dangerous precedent that could silence experts whose perspectives are inconvenient to political leadership, regardless of merit.\nThe American people deserve a government led by professionals committed to law, science, and the Constitution\u2014not one hollowed out by fear or loyalty tests. This proposal would move us in the wrong direction.\nI urge OPM to withdraw this rule and instead focus on strengthening the civil service, investing in training and performance management, and protecting the nonpartisan values that have long defined federal service.\n",

The merits of scientific grants must be evaluated by scientists who have a deep understanding of the material  and who make decisions on scientific merit, not political ones. This change of rule will put politics first and will result in America being last in global scientific advances.",

      "comment": "As a concerned citizen, I am strongly opposed to the proposed changes that would undermine the stability of and public trust in our government employees. This is a thinly veiled attempt to exert more control by the executive branch. We have already seen how the current administration has fired government employees with excellent performance reviews and replaced them based on political ideology rather than expertise in their field, to the detriment of the American people and the services we pay for.\n\nThis is another step towards autocracy, buried in bland and reasonable-sounding bureaucratic legalese. Our government must remain fair and trustworthy in serving ALL of its people. To do that, we cannot risk firing vast swaths of positions every 4 years. We will lose many great workers from the lack of stability alone. Please reject this proposal.",

      "comment": "The proposed Schedule Policy/Career classification seeks to create a category of federal employees who hold policymaking or confidential roles but lack traditional civil service protections. While marketed as a means to increase accountability and flexibility, this structure inherently depends on stable and consistent executive leadership. In the current environment\u2014where the President is experiencing visible and accelerating cognitive decline\u2014such leadership stability is in serious question.\n\nThe success and security of any Schedule Policy/Career appointment relies on sustained political support, clear policy direction, and continuity at the highest levels of government. Cognitive deterioration at the top can lead to unpredictable shifts in personnel priorities, internal power struggles, and rapid turnover\u2014placing those in Schedule Policy/Career roles at significant risk of sudden dismissal or marginalization.\n\nWithout the safeguards of the competitive civil service system, individuals in these roles are effectively at-will employees, particularly vulnerable to leadership changes or political purges. In an administration where the president\u2019s capacity to govern is in doubt, accepting such an appointment may mean trading long-term career stability for short-term access\u2014an increasingly untenable tradeoff in today\u2019s volatile climate.",
